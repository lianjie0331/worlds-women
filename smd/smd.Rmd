For each word $w$ in arbitrary corpus $c$, 

\[\mu_{w} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{D}w_i}{N}\] 

where $w_i$ is the number of times a $w$ appears in document $i$, $D$ is the total number of documents in $c$ and $N$ is the total number of words in $c$.

For each word $w$ in regional sub-corpus $r$, the standardized mean difference score $x$ can be calculated as:

\[x_{w,r}=\frac{\mu_{w,r} - \mu_{w,-r}}{\sqrt{ \frac{var(w_{r})}{N_{r}} + \frac{var(w_{-r})}{N_{-r} }}}\]

Where $var(w_{r})$ is the variance of $w_{i}$ across documents $i$ in $r$.
