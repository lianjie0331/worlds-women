"1","Malawi Orders Parents of Md. Woman Hanged","Africa","Florence Simfukwe of Hyattsville was at work when the bad news came in a telephone call from a family friend: Her parents, Orton and Vera Chirwa, are to be hanged for treason in their native country, the small African nation of Malawi. ""It's like I'm having a funeral without the bodies. I'm mourning,"" Simfukwe said of the sentence imposed on her father and stepmother, who are both highly educated lawyers and opponents of the one-party rule of Malawi's President for Life Hastings K. Banda. The decision imposed May 5 by a Malawian court sent the 42-year-old widow into an emotional tailspin. Since that day, she has been unable to concentrate on her college courses and has felt ""really depressed."" Simfukwe, who supports her three sons by working as a delivery room nurse at Columbia Hospital for Women, also fears that her youngest brother, Fumbani, 27, is dead. Detained by Malawian security police along with her parents on Christmas Eve 1981, he has not been seen or heard from since. The Chirwas have appealed the death sentences. A strong, articulate woman who talks with warmth and an earthy verve, Simfukwe has felt the toll of her parents' troubles. ""I go back and forth between being mad and feeling sorry for myself,"" said Simfukwe, who sings in the choir of the Hyattsville Presbyterian Church, where she has found moral support. Jack Carlson, pastor of the church, said he and many of his parishioners have asked U.S. congressmen to intercede and have written letters to Malawian officials ""to bring our concern to the attention of the Malawian government."" They have never received a reply from Malawi, he said. Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), Charles McC. Mathias Jr. (R-Md.) and Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) have all been in touch with the State Department to express their concern about the case, staff aides confirmed. But State Department officials have said that there is little they can do beyond emphasizing to the Malawi government their concern that the Chirwas received due process of law. The history of Orton Chirwa, 64, is intricately bound up with that of his country: The first black Malawian called to the British bar, he helped write Malawi's constitution and served as the country's first justice minister and attorney general. His wife, Vera, 51, is the country's first woman lawyer and they are both well known in international legal circles. News of the death sentences shocked many lawyers and followers of African political developments, who say the sentence is unduly harsh for the alleged crimes. In addition, the lower court in which the Chirwas were tried does not ""comply with international standards of due process,"" according to Niall MacDermot, secretary general of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists. ""Many years ago they set up traditional courts in Malawi to try criminal offenses. They were composed of chiefs without legal training and no lawyer has any right of appearance before the courts so the accused cannot be defended,"" said MacDermot, who knows Chirwa personally. Trying a person for treason in one of the local courts rather than in the country's higher courts ""is a little bit like trying someone for homicide in a District small claims court,"" said Jay Jacobson, a New York lawyer who was sent by the Kennedy administration to help the Malawians negotiate their independence from Britain and met Chirwa then. Simfukwe said that her father began to oppose Banda, Malawi's first president, shortly after the country achieved its independence in 1964. That same year, after receiving death threats, he and his wife went into exile in neighboring Tanzania. In 1977 they set up the Malawi Freedom Movement, which published tracts criticizing Banda and calling for his overthrow. But by all accounts, the movement did not engage in violent activities. Simfukwe came to the United States with her diplomat husband in 1971 when he was assigned to the Malawian Embassy here. But because of Simfukwe's family connections, her husband was so harassed by other embassy employes that he quit in 1972, she said. They were given permanent residence permits to remain in the United States and he made his living at odd jobs, Simfukwe said. During a trip home to Malawi to visit relatives in 1977 they were both arrested and held for a week by Malawi police, Simfukwe said. While being interrogated about her father's activities, she said, they were refused food for a week. Her husband, who was on special medication after a kidney transplant, was denied his treatment. He died six months after they returned from Malawi. In early 1982, Simfukwe received word from a sister living in Zambia, which borders on Malawi, that her parents and her brother had been kidnaped by Malawi security police. Malawi authorities deny this and say the Chirwas were arrested after they slipped into Malawi with the intention of overthrowing the government. Simfukwe says that as a wanted man, her father would not be ""stupid"" enough to enter Malawi. The Chirwas were detained incommunicado until their trial, which began last July and resulted in conviction and the death sentence. They have appealed the sentence, but foreign observers point out that the appeals court of the traditional legal system also does not meet international standards of due process. According to ICJ's MacDermot,""we know of no evidence presented at the trial which would amount to what we would call treasonable activity. In a democratic society it would be perfectly lawful."" The ICJ, Amnesty International, the House subcommittee on Africa and the American Bar Association's International Law and Practice Section, have all made appeals to Banda for a commutation of the death sentence. A State Department official said: ""We are interested in making sure that the Chirwas receive due process of law under Malawian law and that's all we can really express an interest in . . . . We hope that this former colleague of President Banda and his wife will receive the full consideration of Malawian law and that their appeal will be heard."" He added that ""up to this point we have no reason to question"" that due process has been followed. Officials at the Embassy of Malawi declined to comment on the case. Meanwhile, Simfukwe and her sons, who attend Riverdale Elementary School and Bladensburg High School, wait anxiously for news. ""I'm in mourning and yet they are not really dead, pyschologically it's really rough,"" Simfukwe said. ""But I still believe that miracles do happen in this day and age. But knowing the way things happen in Malawi I'm dead scared, but I try to be optimistic because I believe in God. But it's the helplessness, being so far away here. I guess that's what's eating me.""",1983,"Malawi"
"2","Official Asks Clemency for Parents of Md. Woman","Africa","The Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, has asked Malawi's president to grant clemency to the parents of a Hyattsville woman who have been convicted of treason and sentenced to hang. Florence Simfukwe expressed gratitude when told Tuesday of Moi's intercession on behalf of her parents, Orton and Vera Chirwa, and said she is hoping that international appeals will help. The reaction of Malawi President-for-Life Hastings K. Banda to Moi's appeal could not be learned and it was also unknown whether an execution date has been set. The Chirwas, who led a Malawi opposition party outside the country, were found guilty of treason and sentenced by a Malawian court May 5. They have appealed the sentence. ""The more people write, the better, especially the heads of state. I really appreciate the concern they have for human rights,"" said Simfukwe, a 42-year-old widow who has been in the U.S. 13 years and supports her three sons by working as a nurse at Columbia Hospital for Women in Washington. Moi took the unusual step in his capacity as OAU chairman in a May 16 letter to President Banda, according to reports in the Kenya press. African leaders, sensitive to charges of intervention in the internal affairs of the OAU member states, infrequently make public pleas for clemency in domestic political cases. The Kenya Times, a publication of Moi's ruling party, reported that Moi wrote Banda after receiving an appeal to help the Chirwas from the World Young Women's Christian Association, the international umbrella group of YWCAs. Moi acknowledged in his letter to Banda that the Chirwas were given due process of law in Malawian courts, but he requested that Banda spare their lives on humanitarian grounds, the newspaper said. Legal observers here say that Malawian traditional courts, in which the Chirwas were tried, do not meet international legal standards of due process. Chirwa, 64, and his wife, 51, both well-known lawyers, were active in Malawi's independence struggle against Great Britain two decades ago. Chirwa served as Malawi's first Attorney General and Justice Minister before a falling out with Banda that forced him into exile.",1983,"Malawi"
"3","Steinem Arrested At Embassy; Protest Leader Hails Day of 'Victories'","Africa","Feminist Gloria Steinem was arrested with two other persons at the South African Embassy here yesterday as part of the continuing demonstrations here and elsewhere against apartheid. Steinem, publisher of Ms. magazine; Andrew McBride, D.C. commissioner of public health, and the Rev. Rollins Lambert, a member of the U.S. Catholic Conference, were arrested and charged with demonstrating within 500 feet of an embassy, a misdemeanor, D.C. police said. Shortly before their arrests, the three marched in a peaceful demonstration about 60 yards from the embassy with more than 150 other protestors. Daily protests at the embassy, part of the ""Free South Africa"" movement organized by the lobbying group TransAfrica, have been occurring since Nov. 21. Randall Robinson, director of TransAfrica, proclaimed that yesterday was a day of ""victories"" because a Pittsburgh department store and a Minneapolis bank both stopped selling Krugerrands, the popular South African gold coins. Also, he said, the South African honorary consulate in Boston was closed because of demonstrations and longshoremen in San Francisco voted not to unload South African cargo. So far, 286 persons have been arrested in demonstrations in cities across the country, including New York, Chicago, Houston and Seattle, Robinson said. ""This thing is growing,"" he said, predicting the number of arrests will increase ""dramatically"" beginning in January when Congress reconvenes. But South African Ambassador Bernardus Fourie has said that U.S. demonstrations will have no effect on his government's policies. Steinem denounced the government of South Africa for denying basic civil and human rights to the 22 million members of the black majority there. As a feminist, she said, ""I am against any caste system"" because they usually discriminate against women. McBride urged an end to apartheid, South Africa's controversial system of segregation, because it has led to poor health conditions among blacks in the country, including a high infant mortality rate. As the crowd of demonstrators marched in a single file near the embassy at 3051 Massachusetts Ave. NW, some raised placards that urged passing motorists to ""Honk for Freedom"" and ""Stop Apartheid."" Dozens honked and raised their fists, but one man yelled ""Never!"" as he rode past on his motorcycle.",1984,"South Africa"
"4","CORRECTIONS","Africa","An editorial interpolation in an interview with Mayor Andrew Young published in today's Washington Post Magazine, which was printed in advance, inaccurately states the circumstances of the imprisonment in South Africa of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela. Mandela was sentenced to life in prison in August 1964. He was held in the maximum security prison on Robben Island in Table Bay until April 1, 1982, when he was transferred to a prison on the mainland in Pollsmoor, South Africa. In yesterday's Metro section, an article on infant mortality incorrectly stated that Greater Southeast Community Hospital, D.C. General Hospital and Georgetown University Hospital all treat seriously ill newborns transported from other District hospitals. Of the three facilities, only Georgetown has such a program. Also, Dr. Paul Domson's comments on the need for mothers-to-be to lose weight referred only to very overweight women. An article yesterday about a police investigation of counterfeit $1 and $5 bills in Prince George's and Charles counties incorrectly spelled the name of James Rembold, one of the men arrested.",1985,"South Africa"
"5","A ZIMBABWE ISSUE: KILLING OF BABIES","Africa","Eriya Jokasi was 38 years old, unemployed and a widow with seven children when she secretly gave birth to a baby in a cornfield and, using a heavy rock, killed it. Mrs. Jokasi, uneducated and dependent on her tribal chief for financial support, told the police that she killed the infant out of fear that her dead husband's relatives would expel her from their rural village if they learned she had had another man's child. She was sentenced to nine years in prison. But the Zimbabwe Supreme Court, calling for more research into the underlying causes of such killings, later reduced the sentence to four years. The court case and the judgments highlight both the psychological pressures involved in what is known here as ''baby dumping,'' and the ways that this southern African nation is grappling with the issue as one that is as much sociological as it is criminal. A Widespread Problem Infanticide, of course, is not peculiar to Zimbabwe, and sociologists maintain that improvements in a nation's social and economic conditions can reduce the number of such cases. Since 1967, courts here have given about 90 prison sentences to women charged with killing their babies -Zimbabwean law does not differentiate between murder and infanticide as crime. But one supporter of women's rights said the number of cases did not reflect the seriousness of the problem because the ''percentage of actual incidents, which no one can determine, is another thing entirely.'' Many Zimbabweans view the crime as abhorrent and callously premeditated. But some lawyers and women's rights groups say it often represents an act of desperation in male-dominated Africa, where women have low status and few options and tend to be economically dependent. Some women conceal pregnancies and then kill their babies, in the view of these lawyers and rights groups, because they fear abandonment by parents who would lose much of the ''lobola,'' or the ''bride's price,'' that a family might have received from a suitor had their daughter remained a virgin. Stigma of Rape This group includes schoolgirls who have been educated to increase the amount of lobola that families can demand, and who face expulsion from school and rejection by their families if they become pregnant. Others may be victims of rape but, fearing divorce or ostracism because of the social stigma, do not report it. Still other women become pregnant because of promises of marriage. Among some ethnic groups a woman must conceive before marriage to prove that she is fertile, but later may be abandoned by the baby's father. The father can be ordered by the court to provide child support, but such payments are said to be rare. Abortion is illegal in Zimbabwe, except in specific cases such as rape or incest. Still, Government gynecologists estimate that 40,000 illegal and often dangerous abortions are done each year. A widely held belief here is that legalized abortion would increase promiscuity. The same attitude undermines the use of contraceptives, some women's groups say. Older women often accuse younger ones of being prostitutes if they use birth-control methods. And husbands accuse their wives of using contraceptives so they can have extramarital affairs. Infertility Feared Many women who have been raised to believe that their primary function is to bear children also fear that the use of birth control could make them infertile. ''If a woman is rejected by her family and the father of the child and has no job and nowhere to go, these sorts of things crowd in on her and often force her to kill her baby,'' said Kathy O'Meara, a lawyer at the Harare Legal Projects center. She has studied sentencing patterns of women convicted of killing infants and has represented women in court who were convicted of the crime. ''The courts are beginning to take these things into account,'' she said, ''and are realizing that killing a baby is often more sociological than a straight crime.'' Prison sentences of up to 10 years have been handed down for the offense, according to court documents, with the most common sentences ranging from three to five years. The Supreme Court decision last year in the Jokasi case was seen by women's groups as a major judicial shift toward greater sensitivity in sentencing. Problem for Society The court that gave Mrs. Jokasi the nine-year sentence said she showed an ''unbelievable degree of callousness.'' When the Supreme Court reduced the sentence, a justice recommended that the problem be dealt with by society as a whole and called for greater research. Until solid findings are available, the justice said, the courts should avoid the ''extreme of severity presented by sentences of seven to 10 years.'' ''Judges are beginning to realize that baby dumping is a crime of self-defense,'' said Peggy Watson, a member of the Women's Action Group, which was formed in 1983 to safeguard the rights of women and to research the killing of infants. ''As such, there should be more understanding,'' she said. ''It is often not an act of gross wanton cruelty but women fighting for their own survival.''",1987,"Zimbabwe"
"6","KENYAN COURT RULES TRIBE, NOT WIDOW, CAN BURY A LAWYER","Africa","A Nairobi court ruled today that the body of one of Kenya's leading trial lawyers could be buried in his ancestral homeland, ending a legal battle that underscored the powerful force of tribalism in Africa and its intricate system of rights and beliefs. The Court of Appeal ruled that the body of the lawyer, S. M. Otieno, which has remained in Nairobi's mortuary for more than 140 days during the legal dispute, could be given to his fellow Luo tribesmen for a traditional burial in his homeland near Lake Victoria in western Kenya. Members of the lawyer's Luo clan had argued that without a proper tribal burial, the ghost of Mr. Otieno would haunt and torment his survivors. Mr. Otieno's widow, Virginia Wambui Otieno, a member of the rival Kikuyu tribe, had insisted in court that her husband led a modern way of life, disdained tribalism and divorced himself from Luo customs. She fought to have a non-tribal burial for him at his farm near the Ngong Hills on the outskirts of Nairobi. The ruling, by three judges in the Court of Appeal, represented to some Kenyans a victory for African customary law over Western modernity. The judges said it was impossible for an African to disassociate himself from his tribe and its customs, particularly if he was a member of a tribe such as the Luo, who trace descent and kinship through the father rather than the mother. As a result, the judges said, Mr. Otieno was bound by his tribe's customs, and his clan had the right to arrange his burial. A 'Fantastic Ruling' The court's 26-page decision suggested, however, that Parliament consider legislation that takes into account the burial wishes of the deceased and their widows. The judges said tribal elders owed it to ''themselves and their communities to insure that customary laws keep abreast of positive modern trends.'' The lawyer representing the Luo clan in the case, Richard Otieno Kwach, said: ''This is a very fantastic ruling by the court. This goes a long way to confirm the fact that a woman cannot be the head of an African family. Customary law must prevail. I always knew from the start that common law was irrelevant in this case.'' Mrs. Otieno's intertribal marriage to her husband in 1963 was one of the first between Kikuyu and Luo in Kenya and at the time was viewed as shameful. She had portrayed the court battle, which touched on the role of women in modern Africa, as a test case for women's rights in Kenya. In this East African country, as in much of the rest of the continent, men dominate society and women have inferior status. After the judgment, which ended one of Kenya's longest court cases involving a dispute over burial, Mrs. Otieno told reporters that she would take the case to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Attention Focused on Trial ''There is discrimination in Kenya, contrary to the United Nations convention for the elimination of discrimination against women, which Kenya ratified in 1984,'' said Mrs. Otieno, a pioneering feminist who was treasurer of an international women's conference held here in 1985 by the United Nations. The trial, which began in January, gripped the attention of a nation whose political leaders publicly deplore tribal divisions, but exploit them to seek or maintain power. Banner headlines in the three English-language daily newspapers accompanied full transcripts of the court proceedings. Two of the papers published rare special editions after the ruling today. Hundreds of Luo tribesmen from Mr. Otieno's clan crowded around the courthouse in downtown Nairobi and danced and sang after the court's ruling.",1987,"Kenya"
"7","200 Women Are Arrested in Protest in Cape Town","Africa","The police arrested at least 200 women in downtown Cape Town today when they marched toward Parliament to protest political detentions and other conditions in South Africa. Those arrested included Leah Tutu, the wife of Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu; Dorothy Boesak, whose husband is the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and Mary Burton, president of Black Sash, a white women's organization that battles apartheid. The arrests were the latest developments in the defiance campaign begun by anti-apartheid organizations before the country's elections, scheduled for next Wednesday. The black majority is excluded from voting. According to accounts from the police and from Black Sash, the women gathered this morning for a short prayer service in the hall of a Methodist Church in Cape Town. After the service, they went to deliver a message about the condition of political detainees, among other concerns, to the British Embassy, which is on the grounds of Parliament. The police said some of the women carried protest placards. Parliament is not in session, and the British Embassy maintains only a caretaker staff. Like many other countries, including the United States, Britain maintains another embassy in Pretoria when the Government is located there. The police said the women were ordered to disperse, and were loaded into vans when they failed to do so. A police spokesman estimated that 200 to 250 women were arrested. The police said the women would be charged under a 1973 law forbidding unsanctioned gatherings and demonstrations. Tonight, the women were still being brought into the Magistrate's Court in groups of 15 and 20 to be processed and released on their own recognizance, with trials set for October. In a speech in the Transvaal town of Krugersdorp, the South African Law and Order Minister, Adriaan Vlok, accused Archbishop Tutu of a ''blatant and scandalous misuse'' of St. George's Anglican Cathedral in Cape Town. Archbishop Tutu made his cathedral available for an anti-apartheid rally last Sunday when the police banned it at another site. When Archbishop Tutu learned of his wife's arrest, he said he was thrilled with her and the other women who, he said, ''have shown us how to organize these things.'' Mrs. Burton told reporters that the women were protesting capital punishment and the detention of children and were going to ask the British to convey their message to the South African Government. The other women arrested included Farieda Omar, wife of Dullah Omar, a prominent civil-rights lawyer, and Dorothy Zihlanga, who heads the Federation of South African Women. In other protests today, the riot police fired tear gas and live ammunition at high-school students who put up barricades of tires in Mitchell's Plain and Athlone, two mixed-race suburbs of Cape Town. One report said three youths were wounded. In Pretoria, the police reported, eight blacks and two whites were arrested after they tried to board buses reserved for white passengers. The two white women had bought tickets from the drivers and then given them to black companions to use.",1989,"South Africa"
"8","Kenya Teaches Its Citizens Lawlessness","Africa","To the Editor: ""Kenyans Do Some Soul-Searching After the Rape of 71 Schoolgirls"" (front page, July 29), on the events in Meru, is very distressing. Never in my days as a student in a boy's boarding school in Kenya could anything so atrocious have been contemplated. Indeed, such nefarious acts have until now been the sole preserve of the police and paramilitary forces, who have raided women's hostels at the universities while ""quelling"" student disturbances. Government spokesmen attribute the attack to a lack of discipline by male students. You suggest it was because of a general lack of respect for women. However, these reasons are merely symptomatic of the gradual breakdown of civil society and norms due to state-sponsored repression and violence. In the last few years, Kenyans and the world have watched as the Government has undone much of what made Kenya the envy of other African countries. The Government has taught by example that might makes right, unleashing coercive forces on anyone who dares question its policies (most of which have led to disastrous consequences). High-ranking officials have profited from corruption and graft. The Government has destroyed the educational system by ignoring merit in the selection of staff and students, and by changing the curriculum at the President's whim. Cabinet ministers openly cavort with women other than their wives, enticing them with wealth or threats. Any woman who dares challenge the Government (for example, Prof. Wangari Mathaai, the environmentalist who received the 1990 Africa Leadership Prize) faces insults from the President on down. The Kenyan Government must learn that the daily rhetorical venom and physical violence it perpetrates will only breed a culture of violence in the citizenry. This may manifest itself in organized armed struggle, increased violent crime or the type of vile attack that has now occurred. It is not enough for the Government to condemn the attack. The issue of women's rights and status needs to be addressed. Similarly, the male students should be brought to book. But these problems will recur and continue unless Kenya resorts to accountable and participatory government as envisaged by the framers of its constitution (who include Thurgood Marshall). Above all, the government and the political hierachy must lead by example. MAINA KIAI Research Fellow, TransAfrica Forum Washington, Aug. 1, 1991",1991,"Kenya"
"9","Kenya Doesn't Have Monopoly on Violence","Africa","To the Editor: Maini Kiai seems to be out of touch with reality (""Kenya Teaches Its Citizens Lawlessness,"" letter Aug. 12). What government in the world does not respect force? Governments have armies, police, commanders in chief and military guards of honor. This is not violent? Who are America's heroes? George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Rambo? Under what circumstances did they become heroes? And who are Kenya's heroes? The freedom fighters who rebelled against colonial rule? Were they not violent? It is a cop-out to lay blame for the tragic death of 19 girls in a boarding school in central Kenya at the door of the Government. Not so long ago, a crazed gunman killed a number of women students at a college in Canada; the United States has the highest rate of homicide in the world. Are we therefore to conclude that the Governments of Canada and the United States teach their citizens lawlessness? All of society bears some responsibility for acts of violence, and especially violence against women. Kenya is no worse than other places in this regard.

"10","Argentine Team Digs Up Ethiopia's Hidden Truth; Forensic Findings to Be Used in Atrocity Trials","Africa","From an open pit in a glade where birds sing, a young woman in jeans and sneakers dusts off the bones of human skeletons and neatly packages fragments of hands and feet in paper bags. Using scalpel and paintbrush, scissors and garden scoop, Mercedes Doretti pries bones, clothing and ceramic shards from the red earth and sorts them for later analysis in the laboratory. The skeletons, flung face down in the pit with ropes around their necks, were men and women killed by government hit men during the 17-year regime of military dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam. They are relics, officials say, of a reign of terror without precedent in modern Ethiopia, a turbulent era of civil war in the field and brutal repression behind the front lines. Doretti, 35, is one of the 12-member Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team that has traveled from Kurdistan to the Balkans, using forensic techniques to provide legal proof of mass killings. Most of the team's work is funded by human rights groups. In Ethiopia, the evidence will be used to undergird thousands of documents and the testimony of witnesses at the trials of hundreds of ex-officials held since a new government took power in mid-1991. If the proceedings are carried out on the scale promised by the Ethiopian government, they would be the biggest war crimes trials since the Allied powers brought Nazi criminals to justice at Nuremberg, Germany, in 1945-49. A primary focus in the Ethiopian trials will be the 1977-78 ""Red Terror,"" when the Marxist government crushed an urban-based insurgency and killed at least 10,000, according to estimates by rights groups. Tens of thousands of other Ethiopians were imprisoned or tortured. The Addis Ababa gravesite unearthed by Doretti and her colleagues contained 30 Red Terror victims who apparently were hanged and dumped in a 12-foot hole. The team, sponsored by Physicians for Human Rights and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, also has collected human remains in the northern town of Hawzein, which the Ethiopian air force bombed on market day in June 1988, killing hundreds. The sites are among scores of mass graves dug up under the three-year tenure of President Meles Zenawi, whose government is dominated by a former rebel front that ousted Mengistu. ""This grave is proof that evildoing will never remain hidden and that one day, all oppressors will come down,"" said an Ethiopian priest, who recited blessings over the Addis Ababa site. ""We must pray that never again will this happen in Ethiopia."" ""Never again"" could be the motto of the forensic team, which has exhumed and examined countless victims of state terror since its inception 10 years ago at the advent of democracy in Argentina. Born of popular angst over some 9,000 victims who ""disappeared"" during the Argentine military government's repression of leftists in 1976-83, the group's first assignment was to produce evidence for trials of members of the military junta charged with ordering the killings. Many of the Argentine group had relatives who were killed. Doretti and fellow university students were trained by Clyde Snow of Norman, Okla., who pioneered the combination of anthropological excavation and forensic science that is practiced by only a few specialists today. Together, they exhumed skeletons used as evidence during the Argentine trials, at which Snow was an expert witness. ""From the standpoint of human rights, forensic anthropology started in Argentina in 1984,"" Snow said in a recent interview here. ""It turns out we played a pretty central role in a lot of cases."" Five generals from three Argentine military juntas were convicted of mass killings -- one of the few times in recent history where former government officials have been brought to justice for such atrocities. The generals were jailed but ultimately pardoned under a general amnesty. In El Salvador, the team discovered hundreds of buried skeletons in the remote village of El Mozote, providing proof of the massacre there that had been the biggest of El Salvador's 12-year civil war. The team's evidence was critical to last year's report by the U.N.-sponsored Truth Commission, which revealed atrocities long denied by the U.S.-backed Salvadoran military. The group also has investigated mass graves near Vukovar, Croatia, where journalists have reported some 200 Croatians slaughtered by Serb soldiers. The suspected perpetrators are to appear before the International Court of Justice. Forensic anthropologists resemble archaeologists as they gently coax information from remains and other evidence, like identity cards or jewelry, from the ground. Once in the laboratory, their detective work is similar to that of a coroner, except that they are typically working with old bones, not fresh corpses. A restored skull can produce vital evidence. In Argentina, ex-military leaders maintained that the ""disappeared"" were killed during armed struggle. Most victims examined by the forensic team were executed by a bullet to the back of the head. Teeth and bones can provide clues for identification. Their hard structures preserve a victim's DNA, the genetic code that can be traced to the blood samples of living relatives. If that fails, the team might match photographs of a missing person with an unearthed skull, photographing it at the same angle and distance. This technique was used to identify Nazi concentration camp doctor Josef Mengele when his skeleton was dug up in Brazil in 1985. ""Superimposing a photo is generally not conclusive. It's just another clue,"" said Luis Fondebrider, another founding member of the group. ""But you try to match the physical evidence with what you know."" ""A document can be forged, a witness can be torn apart on the stand, but we bring scientific evidence that gives the sense that these things really happened,"" Snow said. ""In a court, this kind of evidence adds immensely to the credibility of the case."" In Ethiopia, he said, ""we all know bad things happened on a terrible scale, but we can't examine and identify every skeleton out there. ""What forensic science can do is act like a spotlight, singling out cases that are typical,"" he added. Creating a historical record for a country like Ethiopia or Argentina is another aim, ""so that the revisionists cannot come along 15 or 20 years later and say this never happened,"" Snow said. ""Hopefully, laying these things out in daylight will have a chilling effect on others tempted to commit such crimes in the future."" Finally, there is a sense of ""closure"" for the families of the victims. ""If a son or daughter has simply 'disappeared,' it's unfinished. Their lives have been paralyzed,"" Doretti explained. ""Of course, it's always terribly painful to tell the family that they are dead. You are cutting down their hope that their child is still living. ""But at the same time, it is also a great relief that, after so many years, they can finally bury their loved ones. In a way, it is the end of their anguish.""",1994,"Ethiopia"
"11","U.S. Frees African Fleeing Ritual Mutilation","Africa","Fauziya Kasinga, who sought sanctuary in the United States in 1994, saying she was escaping her African tribe's custom of mutilating the genitals of young women, was released by Federal immigration authorities yesterday after more than a year of sometimes harsh confinement in a detention center in New Jersey and prisons in Pennsylvania. Immigration officials said they decided to free Ms. Kasinga, 19, of Togo, because she has developed strong ties in recent months to religious and human rights groups who have promised to support her and insure she shows up for legal hearings. The officials phoned her lawyers yesterday with the decision and then told Ms. Kasinga. ""They called me in,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe I was leaving the prison today. I was screaming!"" Her case, scheduled to be heard on May 2 by the highest administrative tribunal in the immigration system, is expected to set a precedent that will influence the treatment of other women who say they are fleeing genital mutilation, a common rite in 26 African nations. Officials said the case might not be resolved for a year, and the limited detention space could be better used. But Ms. Kasinga's lawyer, Karen Musalo, said she believes the Immigration and Naturalization Service let her client go only after an April 15 article in The New York Times detailing the case and the conditions of her detention led to a public outcry, a barrage of news accounts and the promise of continuing protests by an array of advocacy groups. ""When their decision to detain her saw the light of day, there was an outpouring of concern and shock from the public,"" said Ms. Musalo, acting director of the International Human Rights Clinic at American University, Washington College of Law. ""I don't want to sound like a curmudgeon -- we're extremely pleased -- but we hope it doesn't take this kind of outcry for justice to be done for other asylum seekers who are being detained."" Immigration officials said publicity did not influence the decision to release Ms. Kasinga. David Martin, general counsel for the Immigration Service, said her lawyer had within the last week informed the agency that a Bahai family had agreed to take her in during the appeals process, giving her roots in the Bahai community and a way for immigration officials to monitor her. ""This decision was made by headquarters in consultation with the district director and he does concur with it,"" said Carole Florman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which operates the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Ms. Musalo and several law students who have worked on Ms. Kasinga's case and talked to her daily over the last six months picked her up at the York County Prison in York, Pa., yesterday. Ms. Kasinga skipped through the gate into the arms of her overjoyed, tearful legal advocates. She held a small box containing her few possessions. She spoke hesitantly to a crowd of reporters as the women she has lived with at the prison crowded at a window to wave goodbye. ""There's nothing like freedom,"" she said later, laughing exultantly. ""I want to be happy, to start a new life."" Ms. Kasinga will live with a family that is part of the Bahai community in a Washington suburb and will also spend time with a cousin in the area. Eventually, she said, her dream is to go to college, get an apartment and a car and become an accountant. Layli Miller Bashir, one of the law students who has worked on Ms. Kasinga's behalf, is a member of the Bahai religion who organized support for Ms. Kasinga among the Bahais. Ms. Miller Bashir's mother sent Ms. Kasinga yarn and needles for knitting while she was in prison. Ms. Kasinga said Ms. Miller Bashir is like a sister to her. Last night, Ms. Kasinga put on a flowing sun dress sprinkled with pink and white flowers that Ms. Miller Bashir loaned her -- the first dress she had worn since she arrived in America. At the conclusion of the celebration with her legal team and the family she is staying with, Ms. Kasinga blew out a single candle on the cake but kept her wish a secret. Ms. Kasinga arrived at Newark International Airport in December 1994, carrying another woman's passport she said she bought in Europe and seeking asylum. She was first held at the Esmor detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where she said she was shackled at times, denied sanitary napkins and put in isolation. After an uprising there last June, she and other asylum seekers who had entered the United States in the New York area were sent to prisons in Pennsylvania. There, she shared a maximum security cell with an American convict and was strip searched. In August, an immigration judge in Baltimore rejected her asylum claim, saying her account was ""not credible."" In October, Ms. Kasinga's lawyers asked the immigration service to release her, pending the outcome of her appeal. But in November, J. Scott Blackman, district director of the immigration service's Philadelphia office, denied the request, saying that the immigration judge who heard her case had not believed her and that she might flee before her appeal could be heard. In January and February, Ms. Musalo said she negotiated with lawyers in the immigration service's Washington headquarters and was hopeful they would overrule Mr. Blackman. But in March, she said, she was informed that Mr. Blackman still refused to change his decision. Ms. Kasinga says she came to America, seeking asylum, after her family forced her to become the fourth wife of a man old enough to be her father, a man who insisted she undergo genital mutilation, typically done without anesthesia. She said she had been protected from the tribal practices of polygamy and female genital mutilation by her wealthy father, a businessman who personally opposed the practices. Her four older sisters had all married out of the tribe and avoided the bloody rite. But Ms. Kasinga said her father died when she was 16. His family took over the home under the tribe's patriarchal customs, her mother was banished and Ms. Kasinga was married off and days from being subjected to genital mutilation when she fled with her oldest sister's help. Her case will be the first in which the Board of Immigration Appeals considers whether to grant asylum to a woman who says she is fleeing genital mutilation. The board's decision will be binding on all 179 of the nation's immigration judges. By law, an individual can be granted asylum based on a well-founded fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a social group. Ms. Kasinga's lawyers say she is part of a social group: young women of the Tchamba Kunsuntu tribe who resist genital mutilation. Lawyers for the Immigration Service say they will argue that the fear of genital mutilation should be a reason to grant asylum in some cases. But they said women who had already acquiesced to the rite should generally not be eligible for asylum. Nor is it enough to face ostracism for not acquiescing, they said; a woman must literally face being forced into it. If the board believes new evidence merits consideration, lawyers for the service are asking the board to send her case back for reconsideration.",1996,"Togo"
"12","Immigration Case Exposes Cultural Ignorance","Africa","To the Editor: Re ""Woman's Plea for Asylum Puts Tribal Ritual on Trial"" (front page, April 15), which portrays a young woman who fled the African country of Togo at age 17 to avoid the tribal rite of female genital mutilation and an arranged marriage, and now, at 19, is still behind bars in this country awaiting a decision on her request for asylum: I wish I could say I was surprised by the acts committed by the contractors that the Immigration and Naturalization Service hires to keep immigrants like this woman under lock and key. Surely, the strip searches and the other indignities suffered by this woman and others in the care of the Government can serve no purpose other than to humiliate and to strip away whatever dignity these people have left. This is cruel and useless. This case also shows that many judges are ignorant of the cultures of the people who arrive in their courtrooms. For an immigration judge not to realize that female genital mutilation is a real danger to women's health and life shows ignorance at best, but also perhaps xenophobia and racism.

"13","U.S. Grants Asylum to Woman Fleeing Genital Mutilation Rite","Africa","The highest administrative tribunal in the United States immigration system granted political asylum yesterday to a 19-year-old woman from Togo who said she had fled her homeland to escape having her genitals cut off. The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals in the case of the woman, Fauziya Kasinga, is its first recognition ofgenital mutilation as a form of persecution and a basis for asylum. The rite has been practiced on millions of women in 26 African countries. The ruling sets a precedent that is binding on the 179 immigration judges across the country. The few who have heard such cases have been divided in their decisions. The board, part of the Justice Department, rejected the position of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, also part of the department. It had argued that although genital mutilation should be a reason for granting asylum in carefully defined circumstances, Ms. Kasinga's case should be sent back to an immigration judge to consider what the service said were inconsistencies in her story and new testimony from an expert on Togo. Immigration law calls for asylum to be granted to people who can show that they have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, polical opinions or membership in a social group. Ms. Kasinga's lawyers sought a narrow ruling that would also not foreclose future claims by women in different circumstances, for example those who had already been subjected to the practice. The immigration service argued that women who had already undergone the procedure as children, or who would face ostracism, not actual mutilation, for opposing it should not qualify for asylum in most cases. The ruling, written by the chairman, Paul W. Schmidt, rejected the framework proposed by the immigration service. ""We decline to speculate on, or establish rules for, cases that are not before us,"" he wrote. The ruling went on to say that genital mutilation as practiced by the tribe to which Ms. Kasinga belonged, the Tchamba-Kunsuntu, constituted persecution. Karen Musalo, the lead attorney on Ms. Kasinga's legal team from American University, said that by rejecting the immigration service's proposed framework, the board ""had clearly left open the door to women who have been mutilated in the past."" Ms. Kasinga could not be reached for comment, but Ms. Musalo said her client was jubilant. ""Her reaction was one of joy, ecstasy and relief,"" she said. Acknowledging that the board had not adopted his proposed framework, the immigration service's general counsel, David A. Martin, said, nonetheless, ""We're pleased that the board recognized that female genital mutilation came be the basis for asylum."" Researchers on women's refugee issues have said that making genital mutilation a basis for asylum claims would be unlikely to lead to a flood of new claims. Most women are subjected to genital mutilation as young girls, before they have the means to escape. Even those who want to flee later often lack the money to do so, they said. Only a handful of women have asked the United States for sanctuary in recent years because of mutilation. Canada, the first country to grant asylum to women because of genital mutilation, has found that such claims have remained relatively rare. The board's ruling quoted from a report prepared by the immigration service on female genital mutilation in Africa. ""It remains particularly true,"" the ruling quoted the report as saying, ""that women have little legal recourse and may face threats to their freedom, threats or acts of physical violence, or social ostracization for refusing to undergo this harmful traditional practice, or attempting to protect their female children."" The board flatly dismissed the conclusion of an immigration judge, Donald V. Ferlise, that Ms. Kasinga's story lacked rationality and credibility. In contrast, the board found her story ""plausible, detailed and internally consistent."" Ms. Kasinga told the immigration authorities that her father had opposed polygamy and ritual mutilation and, as a wealthy businessman, was able to defy the tribal customs. But he died suddenly when she was 15, and an aunt arranged for her to become the fourth wife of a middle-age man. To avoid the marriage and genital mutilation, Ms. Kasinga said she fled, first to Ghana, then to Germany and finally to the United States, where she had relatives. Landing at Newark International Airport, Ms. Kasinga asked for asylum. She was detained in the Esmor detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., run by a private company under contract with the immigration service. The immigration service later found that Esmor detainees has been subjected to arbitrary cruelties by guards, strip searches and isolation. The conditions led to a disturbance a year ago and Esmor's closing. Ms. Kasinga was then held in Pennsylvania prisons. At the York County (Pa.) Prison, Ms. Kasinga was strip-searched and locked in a maximum security cell with an American convict, said the warden, Thomas H. Hogan. A week before her case was to be heard by the immigration tribunal, after an article in The New York Times described her case, Ms. Kasinga was released. She has been living in the Washington area since her release in April. The detention of a teen-ager seeking political asylum for more than a year brought a pointed footnote in yesterday's ruling. The tribunal noted that Ms. Kasinga had no criminal record and questioned the value of keeping her behind bars. It suggested that immigration service officials ""might well wish to review this policy should future cases of this type arise.""",1996,"Togo"
"14","Woman's Plea for Asylum Puts Tribal Ritual on Trial","Africa","Fauziya Kasinga says she fled her homeland of Togo at age 17 to avoid the tribal rite of female genital mutilation and an arranged marriage as the fourth wife of a man nearly three times her age. When she arrived at Newark International Airport, she felt sure that she would find sanctuary in a country that ""believed in justice."" Instead she has passed her 18th and 19th birthdays behind bars. First, immigration officials took her to the Esmor detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., where she describes being shackled in chains at times, denied sanitary napkins and put in an isolation cell. Last June, she said, she was tear-gassed and beaten during a melee at Esmor, where immigration authorities later concluded that guards had abused detainees. After the Esmor disturbance, she and many other asylum seekers who entered this country illegally in the New York area were sent to prisons in Pennsylvania, where she has been strip-searched and locked in a maximum security cell with an American convict -- an account confirmed by the York County Prison warden, Thomas H. Hogan. ""I feel empty, mute,"" Ms. Kasinga said today in a barely audible whisper, as she sat in her prison blues at the York prison. ""I keep asking myself, 'What did I do to deserve such punishment? What did I do?' "" Ms. Kasinga's two-year ordeal will reach a critical juncture on May 2, when the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest administrative tribunal in the nation's immigration system, is to consider her asylum request. Immigration officials and advocates for refugees say her case is likely to set an important precedent that could influence the handling of a broad array of claims from women who have suffered because of discriminatory cultural practices in their home countries. ""It's the first case in which the board will directly take on the issue of female genital mutilation as the basis for an asylum claim,"" said Karen Musalo, the lead lawyer for Ms. Kasinga at the International Human Rights Clinic, American University, Washington College of Law. By law, people can win asylum if they are found to have a well-founded fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinions or membership in a social group. The statute does not mention gender. Ms. Kasinga's lawyers contend that she is a member of a social group: young women of the Tchamba Kunsuntu tribe who resist genital mutilation. The rite is widespread in 26 African nations. Typically, a tribal elder cuts off the clitoris and sometimes other portions of a woman's genitals without anesthesia. It often leads to serious health problems or even death, which according to Ms. Kasinga, was the fate of her maternal aunt. The World Health Organization estimates that 85 million to 114 million girls and women have been mutilated. The board's ruling in the Kasinga case will be binding on the nation's 179 immigration judges, who have been divided in their handling of such cases, still a rarity. Paul A. Nejelski, a judge in Arlington, Va., granted asylum to a woman from Sierra Leone last August because he said the rite violated her basic human rights. But John F. Gossart Jr., a judge in Baltimore, denied asylum to another woman from Sierra Leone last April. He said the woman could not change her sex, but she could choose whether to submit to her tribe's customary genital mutilation. At the appeal hearing on the Kasinga case, lawyers for the Immigration and Naturalization Service will argue for a new legal framework that would allow genital mutilation to be a reason for granting asylum in carefully defined circumstances. Beyond the issue of asylum, human rights advocates say Ms. Kasinga's case illustrates the injustice of the immigration service's practice of detaining asylum seekers in prisons that are far from lawyers and families and inadequately supervised by the agency. Immigration officials said the asylum seekers were detained in part because of a quirk in the law that treats people entering the country illegally at an airport more severely than those who are caught within the nation's borders. They said they released those who appeared to have credible claims and family ties in United States. Ms. Kasinga said she believed that immigration authorities were just heartless. She said the prospect of being deported to Togo terrified her. Merrick Polansky, an anthropology professor emeritus at the University of California at Los Angeles, who has testified on Ms. Kasinga's behalf, says she is right to be afraid. The professor, who has done research in Togo since 1979, said women in Ms. Kasinga's tribe were sometimes forced into polygamous marriages and forced to undergo genital mutilation. Her story is highly believable, the professor said. And if she is deported, the police, demoralized and underpaid, would almost certainly return her to her husband for a bribe, he said. Tribal Rule Defying a Custom, Paying a Price The following is Ms. Kasinga's account, pieced together from court records, her sworn affidavit, an interview with her at the prison and the bits of documentary evidence she has from Togo: Hers was a charmed childhood of privilege. Her father owned a successful trucking business. The close-knit, devoutly Muslim family -- five daughters, two sons and parents -- lived in a suburb of Kpalime, Togo, in an eight-bedroom house. Unlike most family patriarchs in their tribe, her father, Muhammad Kasinga, opposed polygamous marriage and the ritual mutilation of girls at age 15. When he was a boy he had seen his sister tied up and mutilated. ""She was screaming and he swore he would never allow any of his daughters to have it done,"" Ms. Kasinga said. He was able to defy tribal customs because his wealth made him independent. He sent Ms. Kasinga to a private boarding school in neighboring Ghana to be educated. All four of his elder daughters married men of their own choosing outside the tribe, and none were mutilated. He himself married a woman who had never been mutilated because her own sister had died of a tetanus infection after the ritual. But in 1993, when Ms. Kasinga was 16, her father died suddenly after a severe asthma attack -- and everything changed. In accordance with the tribe's patriarchal customs, Ms. Kasinga's mother was banished from their home, and the father's only sibling, a sister, Haja-Mammud, moved in and took control of the finances. She was the fourth wife of a man who had died the year before, and she no longer wanted to live with the other wives. She disapproved of the freedom her brother gave his wife and daughters. That summer, Ms. Kasinga was pulled out of school because her aunt believed it was a waste to spend money on the education of a girl who would only marry anyway. The next year, a well-to-do, middle-age man, Ibrahim Isaka, who already had three wives, began visiting their home. Ms. Kasinga was horrified when her aunt told her that she had negotiated a ""marr"" or payment of money from the man toward a marriage with Ms. Kasinga. One morning, Ms. Kasinga said, ""I saw the wedding clothes on the bed, the jewels, the shoes and the bag. 'This is from your husband,' she told me. 'He wants you today.' I said 'No, please, I don't want to marry. Please.' She said it was already arranged."" The marriage took place that very day, Oct. 17, 1994, with the bride and groom in separate locations as custom dictates. A wedding photograph of Ms. Kasinga shows her dressed in lavish tribal garb, but her eyes are downcast, her expression unutterably sad. One of the few bits of documentary evidence of Ms. Kasinga's story is her marriage contract, which bears Mr. Isaka's signature and year of birth, 1950. In defiance, Ms. Kasinga refused to sign. A few days later, a tribal woman was supposed to come ""to scrape my woman parts off,"" Ms. Kasinga said. By custom, 40 days after the wounds had healed, her husband was to consummate the marriage. ""I was afraid,"" she said. ""I didn't know how I could get away."" The day after the marriage, Ms. Kasinga's eldest sister, 32-year-old Ayisha, came to visit. While their aunt visited with company, the sisters slipped out of the house to Ayisha's car and drove pell-mell to the airport in Accra, Ghana. Her sister gave her $3,000 and put her on the first plane out, a midnight flight to Germany. For two months, Ms. Kasinga lived in Duseldorf with a woman she met at the airport, in exchange for cooking and cleaning for her. For $600, she bought a passport from a Nigerian man who told her she could ask for asylum in America, where she had a cousin in the Washington area. Behind Bars Stripped and Alone In a Cold Room She arrived at Newark airport on Dec. 17, 1994. She said she immediately told the customs officer that the passport was not hers and asked for asylum. To her shock, she was transported to the Esmor detention center where she was put in a large, cold room with no windows except for a small one in the metal door. A guard told her to take off her clothes. It was the first time Ms. Kasinga, then 17 years old, had undressed in front of a stranger. She was menstruating and asked to keep her underwear, but she said the guard refused. Freezing and scared, she sat on a toilet in the room, shivering. When she looked up at one point, she saw a male guard looking at her through the door. The humiliations of life at Esmor, a jail that was privately run under a contract with the immigration service, had only begun. She was given a pair of sandals, both for the right foot, and stained underwear that fell down unless she tucked it under a belt. At one point, she was put in a small isolation cell for five days because she washed her hands before sunrise in a ritual before her morning prayers, breaking a rule that no one was to use the showers before 6 A.M. Then she lived through the melee that swept through Esmor last June. The immigration service issued a report after the disturbance that documented many of the abuses Ms. Kasinga said she had endured. The agency concluded that the poorly paid guards had treated the inmates with capricious cruelty. Ms. Kasinga and other asylum seekers were moved to prisons in Pennsylvania that had contracted with the immigration service. First, she went to the York County prison, then was moved to the Lehigh County prison last August. The Judge 'This Alien Is Not Credible' On Aug. 25, Ms. Kasinga's case went before Donald V. Ferlise, an immigration judge in Philadelphia. But her lawyer Eric Bowman, hired by her cousin, had not submitted a sworn affidavit from Ms. Kasinga providing a narrative of her experience, as is often done in asylum cases. And Layli Miller Bashir, a 23-year-old law student at American University who had researched the case for Mr. Bowman, conducted the direct examination of Ms. Kasinga, crucial for establishing her story in the absence of an affidavit. Ms. Miller Bashir said she had never met Ms. Kasinga in person until that morning, nor had she ever examined a witness in court before. They had spoken only a few times on the phone. The law student said she felt she quickly lost control of the hearing. At the hearing's conclusion, the judge said he found several elements of Ms. Kasinga's story unbelievable: that her aunt would have consulted with the banished mother about the marriage she was arranging for the girl; that Ms. Kasinga had met a woman at the airport in Germany who let her move in right away, and that Ms. Kasinga had met a man on a train who sold her a passport. The judge also said it did not make sense that Ms. Kasinga claimed she would be forced to undergo mutilation since her sisters had avoided it, and Ms. Kasinga herself had delayed it until after her marriage. ""The court wonders then how absolute can this tribal law be with so many exceptions being allowed for that rule,"" the judge said at the hearing. In a withering comment, the judge said, ""I have taken into account the lack of rationality, the lack of internal consistency and the lack of inherent persuasiveness in her testimony, and have determined that this alien is not credible."" Mr. Bowman said he believed that the judge was not open to this kind of asylum claim. After announcing that asylum was denied, Judge Ferlise asked Ms. Kasinga if she understood his ruling. Devastated, she whispered inaudibly. ""Hello,"" the judge said, repeating his question. Again she could not be heard. ""Hello,"" he said again, until finally she answered with a ""yes"" that the transcriber could hear. Her feet were then shackled in chains, she was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom. Dreams In Deep Despair, Imagining Togo Ms. Miller Bashir, distraught by the outcome of the case, returned to law school that fall and persuaded Professor Musalo, who heads the international human rights clinic there, to take the case on appeal, pro bono. In January, Ms. Kasinga was moved back to the York County prison and placed in maximum security because minimum security was full, the warden, Mr. Hogan, said in an interview. Ms. Kasinga said she was often strip-searched. ""What I hate is when they put 20 or 30 people in a room,"" she said. ""They strip all of us together. They tell us to turn around, open your legs, squat. They stand there looking at you. Sometimes they laugh."" Asked how many times she had been strip-searched, Ms. Kasinga said, ""I can't count. Plenty, plenty times."" ""I don't know how high she can count,"" the warden replied angrily, when asked about her assertion, saying that she was strip-searched once when guards mistook her for an American and perhaps on other occasions when she left the prison for a meeting or hearing. The warden said the asylum seekers and other immigrant detainees were intermingled with the American convicts in the prison, who range from drug users to murderers, without any problem until the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children issued a scathing report in September, denouncing the prison conditions for immigrants in Pennsylvania. Mr. Hogan said the I.N.S. detainees were given separate sleeping quarters sometime after the report was released. Ms. Kasinga, who has been shifted to minimum security, said that happened only two weeks ago. ""The I.N.S. has very little control once they contract for the space,"" Mary Diaz, the commission's director, said. ""They allow the jailers to run the show."" At York, the days drag on monotonously, and Ms. Kasinga says she often feels despair. Sometimes, she said, she dreams she is back in Togo in her family's big house with the flowers blooming in profusion at the front porch and green fish darting in the courtyard pond. In the dream, her father is always alive. Then she wakes up on a prison pallet. ""All my spirit is gone,"" she said. ""I just want to leave the prison. Why am I here?""",1996,"Togo"
"15","Moving the System, Saving the Girl","Africa","Fauziya Kasinga, the 20-year-old woman from Togo who fled her homeland to avoid a forced polygamous marriage and genital mutilation, has been released by the Immigration and Naturalization Service after more than 16 months of detention. It's a victory for her, for the human rights of women and for the power of public opinion. Kasinga's cause was first taken up by Equality Now, the New York-based human rights organization that fights female genital mutilation through letter-writing campaigns. Surita Sandosham, a lawyer who is its executive director, said the group became aware of Kasinga's situation during the United Nations conference on women held in September in Beijing. Layli Miller Bashir, a law school student at American University who had worked on Kasinga's case, told the group that an INS judge based in Philadelphia had ruled on Aug. 25 against granting her asylum and that she faced deportation back to Togo. Bashir also called the case to the attention of Professor Karen Musalo of the International Human Rights Clinic at American University's school of law. Musalo took the case on and is handling her appeal, now scheduled for Thursday. A request for humanitarian release for Kasinga was denied Nov. 15, and she was held in the Lehigh County Prison in Allentown, Pa., where she was subjected to strip searches and housed with criminals. Most recently, she was in prison in York County, Pa. Kasinga's plight was first made public in this column in January, where the argument was made that the judge who initially heard her case showed an appalling lack of knowledge about tribal customs -- he dismissed her as not credible -- and that at the very least she should be released while her appeal is being considered. Since then, other publications have written about her case, and Equality Now has ""been besieged by thousands of individuals who want to help her,"" Sandosham said. Kasinga's cause also was taken up early by Reps. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.). On Feb. 7 they wrote a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, urging Kasinga's release and the granting of asylum on the grounds that mutilation was a form of persecution and that her case met the guidelines for asylum. Schroeder sent another letter to Reno and to the INS director April 16, saying the conditions of Kasinga's detention were simply compounding a tragedy. Last Friday, the INS was invited to brief the Congressional Caucus for Women on Kasinga's situation. An aide to Schroeder said that members were concerned not only about Kasinga's situation but also about the quality of the INS-contracted facilities that house detained illegal immigrants and the kind of education INS judges are receiving about female genital mutilation. Equality Now wants to keep up the pressure on the INS to consider female genital mutilation a form of persecution that merits granting political asylum. It has installed a special number (1-800-253-9539) open to general supporters of the effort. The INS appears ready to respond. This week, the INS made public a legal brief it will use in Kasinga's hearing, which argues that the fear of being forced to undergo female genital mutilation -- the excision of the clitoris and often other parts of the genitalia with knives or sharp rocks -- can be grounds for political asylum. Mutilation can cause infections, difficulty in childbearing and sometimes death. David Martin, general counsel for the INS, got it right in the brief when he said it ""amounts to an extreme bodily invasion, an extreme that is compounded when it is imposed under crude and unsanitary conditions."" Kasinga's case is not going to open a floodgate of millions of women seeking asylum, Sandosham said. Tribal pressure to undergo the procedure often is intense, and it takes an extraordinary and courageous young woman such as Kasinga to take a stand against it. Kasinga was brought up by a prosperous and progressive father. He had married outside his tribe to a woman who had not been mutilated, and he did not allow his five daughters to be. Four of his daughters were in monogamous marriages when he died. Upon his death, Kasinga came under the control of her father's sister, a widowed aunt who has insisted on the procedure. Kasinga came to the United States at age 17. Her circumstances were unusual, but she and her supporters have forced the INS to propose a framework for evaluating such cases, for protecting refugee women and giving them a basis to seek asylum on the basis of gender-based claims. This is a success story of women protecting women, of public pressure having an impact and of a government agency responding -- late perhaps, but finally -- in a humane and decent way. Fauziya Kasinga has gotten her first taste of democracy.",1996,"Togo"
"16","Full Immigration Board Hears Female Genital Mutilation Case; Ruling on Asylum for Togo Woman Likely This Summer","Africa","Lawyers for Fauziya Kasinga yesterday asked the highest immigration court in the land to grant her political asylum, saying the 19-year-old West African refugee would face persecution through the ""deadly practice"" of genital mutilation if forced to return to her native Togo. But lawyers for the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, while urging the Board of Immigration Appeals to accept female genital mutilation (FGM) as grounds for asylum in limited circumstances, suggested they did not entirely believe Kasinga's story and asked that her case be sent back to the lower court that denied her asylum petition last year. Both sides made their case at an unusual hearing by the entire appeals board in Falls Church, which met with all 12 members present because of the novel, potentially far-reaching issue before it. Immigration judges have made widely varying rulings in cases involving genital mutilation, and whatever the board decides will be binding on all 179 immigration judges who hear asylum cases around the nation. Paul W. Schmidt, chairman of the appeals board, and other members asked numerous questions during the 90-minute hearing but gave no indication of their views. They are expected to issue a written ruling this summer. ""This is a young woman in a patriarchal society with no one to protect her. There is little doubt about the fate that awaits her in her home country,"" Karen Musalo, a law professor at George Washington University law school, argued on Kasinga's behalf as the shy, slender Togolese woman sat a few feet behind her. Kasinga fled her homeland in 1994, days after she said she was forcibly married to an older man and prepared for circumcision in accordance with tribal custom. She arrived at Newark airport with a false passport and was immediately put in prison while her asylum case progressed. She was released two weeks ago. Musalo asked the board to rule on the facts of Kasinga's case, rather than giving the lower court judge ""a second bite of the apple at her expense."" But she also urged the panel not to leap beyond Kasinga's circumstances by issuing broad guidelines on whether genital mutilation constitutes grounds for asylum before other women from different tribes, countries or personal circumstances have a chance to make their cases, too. In contrast, David E. Martin, chief counsel for the immigration service, made it clear he hoped the board would go ahead and set a precedent, but on narrow grounds. He asked the panel to find that a well-founded fear of female genital mutilation can justify a grant of asylum in some cases, but only if the woman can prove she would be forced to undergo the procedure and has no alternative means of protection. ""There should be important limits on this doctrine,"" Martin said. ""This would not mean that all women from countries where FGM is practiced would be entitled to relief from persecution."" He said Kasinga's case ""should be given another look,"" but that there were ""grave deficiencies and inconsistencies"" in it. Among the inconsistencies he noted were questions about how she obtained a false British passport and whether she had married the older man. Board members asked Martin several times whether he found Kasinga's asylum claim to be credible, but he did not answer directly. The Philadelphia judge who denied her claim said he found much of her story unbelievable, but Musalo argued yesterday that the judge was biased and uninformed about customs in countries such as Togo. Kasinga claimed that after the death of her father in 1994, an aunt took control of her and married her off to a man with three other wives. She said that had she not fled, she would have been forcibly circumcised before consummating the marriage. In many parts of Africa and Asia, the genitals of young women are ritually cut away in the belief that it keeps them pure and faithful. After yesterday's hearing, Kasinga laughed and chatted quietly with a group of lawyers and female supporters as television cameras followed her from the courtroom office tower on Leesburg Pike. Asked how she felt, she murmured that she had not understood much of what was said.",1996,"Togo"
"17","Refugee From Mutilation","Africa","WHAT CAN a global superpower do -- and what, if anything, should it do -- about a cruel cultural practice that, in faraway countries, subjects millions of children every year to an irreversible and ghastly mutilation? In the case of female genital mutilation, the cutting or removal of genitals that is practiced legally and illegally on young girls countries throughout Africa and parts of the Middle East, the answer is: not much. The possibilities for action by this government or outsiders generally are limited to pressuring governments that permit the practice and to sending signals that the international community considers the practice reprehensible. One such signal, and a good one, was sent when this country's highest immigration court ruled to grant asylum to Fauziya Kasinga, a 19-year-old refugee from Togo who had fled that country to avoid the ritual practice. Ms. Kasinga, who was jailed after arriving in the United States on a false passport, argued that the certainty of being subjected to genital mutilation if she were to return home met the U.S. standard of a ""well-founded fear of persecution."" After the request was rejected by a Philadelphia judge, who expressed disbelief that such practices could possibly exist as described, Ms. Kasinga's lawyers appealed to the higher court, which ruled that in her particular circumstances the danger justified the granting of asylum. Some of the opposition to extending the asylum right to this category rests partly on the concern that this ruling could open the floodgates to the estimated 80 million women who have suffered the mutilation already -- not to mention those who might wish to avoid it. But Ms. Kasinga's case is highly unusual. The daughter of a father opposed to the practice, Ms. Kasinga was forcibly married after his death to a man who insisted on it; as his wife, a member of a minority group in Togo and an outspoken opponent of the traditional practice, the court ruled, she also could not be ensured of legal protection from persecution anywhere in Togo. The only other case that has been successful, in Canada, concerned a mother and two daughters who would have undergone the procedure if deported to the custody of their father. These cases are not the stuff of which large and unmanageable new categories of refugees are made. They are instances where the granting of asylum can avert horrific suffering by a particular individual as a result of practices that should be deplored.",1996,"Togo"
"18","Woman Fleeing Tribal Rite Gains Asylum; Genital Mutilation Is Ruled Persecution","Africa","The nation's highest immigration court ruled yesterday that a 19-year-old West African woman should be granted political asylum because she fears the bloody but traditional practice of genital mutilation by members of her tribe. The ruling marked the first time that a court with national jurisdiction recognized the practice of female genital mutilation as a form of persecution, and the decision will serve as a precedent for the 179 immigration judges who hear asylum cases around the country. In an 11 to 1 decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals found that Fauziya Kasinga of Togo was a credible witness and that she met the standards of U.S. law by showing that she had a well-founded fear of suffering genital mutilation. Previous rulings by immigration judges were divided on the issue. ""The characteristic of having intact genitalia is one that is so fundamental to the individual identity of a young woman that she should not be required to change it,"" said the majority opinion written by appeals board Chairman Paul W. Schmidt. An estimated 80 million women have been subject to genital mutilation worldwide, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The crude and frequently dangerous practice is often performed on girls at the age of puberty. The opinion cited evidence that genital mutilation has often been used to assure male domination of women. ""We find that [female genital mutilation] can be a basis for asylum,"" Schmidt said in the opinion. Kasinga fled her homeland in 1994, days after she said she was forcibly married to an older man and prepared for circumcision in accordance with tribal custom. She arrived at Newark airport with a false passport and was immediately put in prison while her asylum case progressed. After being denied asylum by an immigration judge in Philadelphia, she pursued an appeal and was released from detention in April two weeks before the appeals board heard her case. The board found that Kasinga's account was ""plausibly detailed and internally consistent."" Her attorneys had argued that the judge who initially ruled against her was biased and uninformed about practices in Togo. In presenting its case before the appeals board, the INS argued that there were serious inconsistencies in Kasinga's story but the agency declined to make a firm determination on her credibility. ""I am very happy for her. I feel all the injustices she suffered under our system have been, if not redeemed, at least dealt with responsibly,"" said Layli Bashir Miller, a law student at American University who helped Kasinga with her asylum case. In making its grant of asylum to Kasinga, the appeals board rejected arguments by the INS that Kasinga's case ought to be sent back to the immigration judge that originally heard it for reconsideration. The INS, which like the appeals board is a part of the Justice Department, argued that forcible female genital mutilation can be grounds for asylum, and asked the court only for a broad framework that could be used to evaluate applications for asylum by people claiming fear of female genital mutilation. While the ruling broke new ground by recognizing genital mutilation as a form of persecution, much of the appeal board's reasoning was framed around the specific circumstances of Kasinga's case. A key aspect of the ruling concluded that Kasinga was a member of a persecuted social group by virtue of her membership in the Tchamba-Kunsuntu tribe of Togo and by reason of her opposition to the practice of genital mutilation. Among members of that tribe, as in many parts of Africa and Asia, the genitals of young women are ritually cut away in the belief that it keeps them pure and faithful. In another key finding, the appeals board concluded that Kasinga faced the danger of persecution throughout Togo, meaning that the police and other government agencies offered no real protection to her from her husband and other members of her tribe who wanted to subject her to genital mutilation.",1996,"Togo"
"19","Editorial Observer; New Punishment for an Ancient War Crime","Africa","Crimes against women, especially sexual violence, are finally getting the attention they deserve in the prosecution of war crimes. In the case of Rwanda, the turn began a year ago when a witness appearing before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda testified that she had seen rapes by men under the command of Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former Mayor of Taba, Rwanda. He was the first person to be tried by the tribunal, and was charged with genocide, among other crimes. The virtually all-male group of investigators had not found evidence to charge him with responsibility for rape. Navanethem Pillay, a South African who is the tribunal's only female judge, pressed the witness for details. Soon another witness also described numerous rapes on premises that Mr. Akayesu controlled, with Mr. Akayesu's police looking on. After women's organizations increased their pressure on the tribunal to take rape seriously, the court adjourned the case for more investigation, this time focused on sexual violence. Now, a year later, as Judge Pillay and her two fellow jurists ponder Mr. Akayesu's case, they are weighing his guilt on charges that include rape as part of the counts of genocide and crimes against humanity. The United Nations estimated that at least a quarter-million women were raped in Rwanda. Rape has always been a part of war, but has rarely been prosecuted as a war crime. The Nuremberg tribunals did not charge any Nazi with rape, even though some witnesses testified about it. The war crimes tribunal in Tokyo did convict Japanese officers for rape in Nanking. Today, sexual violence is a prominent focus of the international tribunal for Yugoslavia, and may become so in Rwanda. The decisions of these tribunals are already setting international precedent that sexual crimes -- including rape, sexual slavery, and sexual mutilation -- are among the gravest of international crimes. These decisions will likely migrate into the legal systems of many countries, as the Nuremberg decisions did. American military officers writing a new code covering the laws of war are closely watching the tribunals' decisions on sexual crimes. The world's outrage over mass rape in Bosnia was one of the reasons the tribunals were established. Rape was an instrument of ethnic cleansing, part of a campaign of atrocities designed to force civilians to flee. In the town of Foca, Serbs set up specific camps for the repeated rape of female prisoners. Some of the women were held as sexual prisoners for other soldiers. The men who ran Foca were indicted for these offenses on charges of rape, torture, persecution and enslavement, all crimes against humanity or grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. At the Yugoslavia tribunal, which is based in The Hague, a fourth of all the indictments include charges of sexual violence. The Rwanda tribunal has been slower to treat sexual crimes seriously. A new chief prosecutor appointed last year, Bernard Muna of Cameroon, is paying more attention to sexual crimes, and the tribunal now has female investigators and an escort to bring rape victims to the tribunal. But the tribunal still offers no counseling to rape victims. Measures to protect witnesses -- several of whom have been killed before testifying -- remain inadequate. Sexual crimes are also under debate as delegates from around the world negotiate the rules for a new permanent international criminal court. They recently decided to call rape a form of torture, which places it among the most serious war crimes. In June, when delegates hope to reach an agreement, they will debate how to define rape as a crime against humanity. It will also be crucial to hire judges and prosecutors sensitive to the importance of sexual violence, and to create a senior staff position that deals specifically with the issue. While many rape victims fear the social stigma, and others have been threatened into silence, their sheer numbers have guaranteed witnesses at The Hague. There the most serious obstacle to prosecuting rape is the same one impeding the prosecution of all criminals -- they are not being delivered to the court. More than two-thirds of the 27 men the tribunal has publicly charged with rape are not yet in custody.",1998,"Rwanda"
"20","Final Chapter","Africa","IT WAS HER first time. There was blood everywhere. She was not allowed to shower. She hadn't wanted to give in -- not then, she says, and not during the two days of forcible sex that followed. But the soldiers were just that, soldiers, and she was a university student, helpless and terrified and jailed. Her offense? Helping organize a demonstration to protest her government's refusal to increase student loans. For this, she and fellow organizers were taken from their dormitories at Ghana's University of Science and Technology and transported to a detention center in Accra, the capital, where she and another young woman were put in a cell. After some hours the soldiers came. When the women asked for food and water, the soldiers said there was only one way they'd get any: by consenting to sex. ""We didn't,"" the young woman recalls, ""have a choice."" She relates the story flatly, looking down, a shy, short-bodied, soft-voiced woman in purple robe and head wrap and Fila athletic shoes. The judge has already asked her to speak up. It's an important story, after all, a story that will determine where she spends the rest of her life. That's literally true. The woman, Martha, a Ghana native who fled after the prison rape, is trying to convince Judge Joan V. Churchill that she should be granted asylum and permitted to remain in the United States. Like scores of other supplicants who have preceded her this day, she is fighting deportation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, fighting it in a small courtroom on the 13th floor of an obscure Ballston office building. Immigration court, it's called: last stop before the bus station, the airport, the long flight home. Here, ""foreign-born individuals"" who are deemed by the INS to be ""removable"" -- these might include illegal aliens, asylum applicants whose pleas have been rejected, or legal immigrants who have committed certain crimes -- are given a chance in court to argue against deportation. They arrive all day long, some of them able to produce newspaper accounts, human rights reports, marriage certificates and other documentation. Others, like Martha, arrive equipped with essentially one thing: a story. ""My mother had to use herbs -- herbal medicine -- to take care of me,"" Martha whispers in testimony, fingering the head wrap that's now in her hands, describing how she was released after four days at the intervention of the Catholic Church, and told to say nothing of what happened. Her family smuggled her into nearby Togo. She stayed there four months and then, afraid to return to Ghana, took a plane to England and on to New York, entering fraudulently in June 1994 with her sister's passport. In September 1994 she applied for asylum; the case has been pending for three years. And now here she is, flanked by her lawyer, facing the deceptively gentle cross-examination of an INS attorney in a purple blazer and black spike heels. ""You had been in detention for five to six hours and you accepted to have sex with these people?"" says the attorney, Tamila Marshall, whose job it is to question the story from all sides. It's true that a person may be accorded asylum based only on a story, but the story must be internally coherent. And so: Would a virgin really have given in to sex after only a few hours of hunger and thirst? If she was running for her life, why did she not apply for asylum immediately in New York? If her country is intent on persecuting her, why was she later able to obtain a passport of her own from an embassy contact here? Judge Churchill joins in: If she was detained on December 31, 1993, as she said, a week after the student loan demonstration, then the demonstration itself must have occurred on Christmas Day. Is this plausible, given that she has already testified that Ghanaian students take a Christmas break? The questioning goes on and on; a psychologist testifies that Martha suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder but he cannot be certain of the source. Outside, the winter sun is setting red and brilliant over Northern Virginia. Martha leans heavily forward as Judge Churchill begins to dictate her opinion. The judge has heard 10 or 15 cases today, cases of Bulgarians, Salvadorans, Nicaraguans, Guatemalans, Pakistanis. In each case she listened carefully, asked sympathetic questions, permitted cases to be postponed if the person lacked a lawyer or up-to-date fingerprints or a clear understanding of what was happening. She is a reasonable judge, a patient judge, and it is without apparent emotion that she segues from the facts of the case into her decision. ""We find that we do not believe the respondent's story,"" she says, enumerating inconsistencies having to do with dates and details and documents. Martha's story may be true, but it is not clearly true, not sufficiently credible. And so a woman's life is determined by the failure of a story: Martha must voluntarily depart this country ""on or before March 23, '98,"" says the judge, utterly professional, utterly deadpan, utterly unsurprised -- it seems -- that in order to stay in such a country, a young woman might make up such a story as the one that has just been told.",1998,"Ghana"
"21","INS Frees Nigerian Woman During Appeal","Africa","Federal immigration authorities yesterday released from detention a Nigerian woman who says she is fighting deportation to protect her daughter from undergoing female circumcision. The release allowed Virginia Anikwata, of Rockville, who was held in a detention center for three weeks, to rejoin her 10-year-old daughter, Chenidu. Chenidu has been staying with friends and attending school in Montgomery County. Anikwata is a widow, and Chenidu has no other relatives in the country. Anikwata was released while officials consider two petitions filed with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Board of Immigration Appeals. Her petitions contend that she was persecuted as a child in Nigeria by being forced to undergo circumcision, a procedure called female genital mutilation by human rights groups. Anikwata contends that her daughter, a U.S. citizen, would be forced to undergo the same procedure and that both of them could be forced into polygamous marriages under the Ibo tribal tradition. The decision to release Anikwata, 36, from detention was made by Benedict J. Ferro, Baltimore district director of the INS. She was released, Ferro said, while the appeals board considers her petition for political asylum. The INS also is considering a new claim filed this week that says Anikwata's daughter ""would be forcibly subjected to female genital mutilation as a result of the family preferences of her deceased father's family, strong social pressures and government support for the practice of FGM [female genital mutilation]."" Ferro said Anikwata would not ""be taken back into custody or removed until both of these issues are adjudicated."" The new petition, filed by Anikwata's attorney, Martha Saenz, and Morton Sklar, director of the World Organization Against Torture, invokes the provisions of the Convention Against Torture -- ratified by the United States in 1996. The international convention prohibits the deportation of people who have experienced torture or cruel and inhuman treatment or who are likely to experience such treatment in the future. Anikwata entered the United States legally in 1986 on her husband's student visa, but she became an illegal immigrant after his death. She greeted news of her release with joyful tears. ""I thank God for everything,"" she said in a telephone interview upon her release. ""That's all I can say.""",1998,"Nigeria"
"22","Woman Fearful of Mutilation Wins Long Battle for Asylum","Africa","Adelaide Abankwah's ordeal is over. On Friday, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted her petition for political asylum, on the ground that she feared being subjected to genital cutting if she returned to Ghana, her homeland. She is only the second woman granted asylum in the United States because of genital cutting, which millions of African women undergo each year. Ms. Abankwah, 29, requested asylum more than two years ago when she arrived at Kennedy International Airport from Ghana. Instead, she quickly found herself under arrest for trying to enter the country with false immigration papers. Her appeal for asylum was denied by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. And she was detained for more than two years at the Wackenhut Detention Center in Queens, where both her health and her emotional state deteriorated. Her release came on July 19, 10 days after the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan issued a decision supporting her petition. It was the first time a Federal court had supported an asylum petition based on a fear of genital cutting. But the Board of Immigration Appeals had the last word on asylum, and Ms. Abankwah's supporters said the fear that she could be returned to her country still hung over her. With Friday's decision, that fear is gone. Mandy Sullivan, the campaign director for Equality Now, a feminist organization that campaigned for Ms. Abankwah's release, said Ms. Abankwah was speechless about the decision. ""She's relieved that it's all over,"" Ms. Sullivan said. ""It's very hard for her to comprehend -- that it's all over and no one going to come snatch her back."" Ms. Abankwah has been living in the Bronx with Victoria Otumfuor, a Pentecostal minister who was born and raised in Ghana and who befriended Ms. Abankwah while she was in prison. Since her release, Ms. Sullivan said, she has been visiting doctors and volunteering at Equality Now. And she has been waiting. Her detention, and the denial of her asylum petition, sparked widespread protests this spring among immigrant rights groups and legislators from New York, including Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney. The protesters said the immigration service's position on Ms. Abankwah's case demonstrated that the agency was not committed to protecting asylum seekers who flee sex-based persecution. Female genital cutting was outlawed in the United States in 1996. That year the I.N.S. also recognized the practice as a valid form of persecution for immigrants seeking asylum. The decision in that case, based on the petition of another African native, Fauziya Kassindja, who is from Togo, became part of a series of guidelines on sex-based persecution that were issued to immigration judges. But immigration judges are not required to rule that persecution based on an applicant's sex constitutes a valid claim for asylum. Advocates say they rarely do so without public pressure. ""I think it will definitely give the Board of Immigration Appeals something to think about, to look carefully at the way they're making decisions,"" said Mary Diaz, the director of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. ""Hopefully, it will push them again to look at the guidelines on gender-based persecution."" The immigration service did not return a phone call requesting comment yesterday, and the board did not explain its reversal other than to refer to the Federal court's decision and a review of the record. But for Ms. Abankwah, the most important words were there, telling her that her asylum application was being granted and that ""exclusion proceedings are terminated.""  http://www.nytimes.com",1999,"Ghana"
"23","Woman Who Feared Genital Cutting Adapts to New Freedom","Africa","When Adelaide Abankwah walked out of Wackenhut Detention Center in Queens on Monday night, she was wearing the same clothes that she had on more than two years ago when she was arrested at Kennedy International Airport. But this time, they were practically falling off her. Weight loss was only one of the trials Ms. Abankwah endured during two and a half years of detention. She was arrested after she tried to enter the country with a false passport, saying she was fleeing her country, Ghana, so she would not have to undergo ritual genital cutting. During two years of hearings, the Immigration and Naturalization Service repeatedly denied her requests for asylum, saying she had not proved she would be harmed if she returned to the African nation. But this month, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan supported her petition. Her release came as abruptly as her detention had, her lawyer, Jonathan Rauchway, said. She was told to pack her bags, and then she was put in a waiting room. When she finally left the center she walked out to greet some supporters who had made her case a cause celebre in recent months. Then she was driven through the city, where she gaped at the tall buildings, said Jessica Neuwirth, the president of Equality Now, the group that campaigned for her release. ""All this data -- after two and a half years of being in the same room,"" Ms. Neuwirth said. Ms. Abankwah, 29, was then taken to her new home in the Bronx. She is to live there with Victoria Otumfuor, a minister from Ghana who befriended her shortly after she was detained. Yesterday, Ms. Abankwah was in seclusion, resting and trying to absorb her new world. ""In some ways, today is her first day in the real America,"" Ms. Neuwirth said. The immediate agenda includes some medical treatment. Ms. Neuwirth said that for the last three weeks, Ms. Abankwah had been in pain because of a tooth needing root canal work, and would be going to a dentist. She also has gynecological and digestive ailments that need attention. While Ms. Abankwah is free, she must still await a final decision on her asylum request by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Both Mr. Rauchway and Ms. Neuwirth expressed optimism that the board would not prevent Ms. Abankwah from remaining in the United States, but they also said that they did not know when the board would issue its ruling. Ms. Neuwirth said that Ms. Abankwah, whose cause was taken up by Senator Charles E. Schumer and Representative Carolyn Maloney, among others, was still worried that she would be sent back to Ghana. If she is not, her long-term plans include more schooling. In detention, Ms. Abankwah learned English, which she can now read, write and speak, but she had little beyond a primary school education in Ghana. And Ms. Neuwirth said it was likely that with time, a very different personality would emerge from the one that Ms. Abankwah, who was sometimes suicidal, showed in prison. Ms. Neuwirth said such a transformation occurred with Fauziya Kassindja, a woman from Togo who was given asylum in the United States in 1996 based on her fear of having to undergo genital cutting. Ms. Neuwirth said that she thought she had got to know Ms. Kassindja when she was in detention for over a year, ""but I didn't really know her at all. ""What I knew was a very depressed person in detention,"" Ms. Neuwirth said. ""Over time I came to know the person who ran away, who has a completely different spirit. Detention really crushes your spirit."" Ms. Kassindja frequently visited Ms. Abankwah in prison. The two share a language -- Togo is just east of Ghana -- and an unusual experience. Ms. Kassindja has just finished her first year at Hunter College, and Ms. Neuwirth said she hoped an equally bright future was in store for Ms. Abankwah. ""Hopefully, this will get put behind her,"" she said. http://www.nytimes.com",1999,"Ghana"
"24","A War Against Women; Sierra Leone Rebels Practiced Systematic Sexual Terror","Africa","The women slip one at a time into a bamboo hut in this displaced persons camp, and most begin to cry quietly as they tell of being gang-raped and held as sex slaves by rebels who had sought to overthrow the government of Sierra Leone. One 25-year-old woman said she had delivered a still-born baby the day before rebels of the Revolutionary United Front attacked her village in 1998. She was unable to flee with most of the other villagers, and five rebels took turns raping her, she said. When her husband tried to intervene, they killed him. ""I thought at first I was dealing with human beings, so I said I was sad and confused because I had just delivered a dead baby; I was bloody and weak,"" she said between sobs. ""But they were not human beings. After they left I gave up, and I wanted to die. I had no reason to live anymore."" Human rights workers say the woman, who was rescued by a patrol of government troops, is one of thousands who were raped by insurgent forces and other armed gangs during the nation's eight-year civil war. While statistics are not yet available, rights workers said the rebels' rape campaign was as widespread and systematic as similar assaults in the 1992-1995 Bosnian war but has received far less attention. Unlike at least some of the perpetrators in Bosnia, those responsible here likely will never be tried because of a blanket amnesty that was part of the accord that ended the conflict last July. Even more worrisome, U.N. officials and government officials say, is that the rebels may still hold thousands of women in remote strongholds despite the fact that the peace accord required them to free all captive civilians. ""The [rebels] perpetrated systematic, organized and widespread sexual violence against girls and women,"" the New York-based group Human Rights Watch said in a recent report. ""The rebels planned and launched operations in which they rounded up girls and women, brought them to rebel command centers and then subjected them to individual and gang rape. Young girls under 17, and particularly those deemed to be virgins, were specifically targeted. While some were released or managed to escape, hundreds continue to be held in sexual slavery after being 'married' to rebel combatants."" Rose Luz, a physician with the International Rescue Committee, said that what is most shocking about the hundreds of rape cases she is documenting is the ages of the victims. Most were under 14 or over 45--many of whom were too slow or too infirm to flee. Luz said the youngest victim documented so far was 5; the oldest was 75. ""It is the ones who could not get away,"" Luz said. ""They raped whomever they stumbled across."" With the consent of the women involved, Rescue Committee officials arranged for a reporter to be present during some interviews. It was agreed that no names would be used or photographs taken. The interviews were conducted at this camp--about 160 miles southeast of the capital, Freetown--which shelters 22,500 people who were driven from their homes in eastern Sierra Leone by insurgent forces. If the rebels considered a woman attractive or physically fit enough to work, she would likely be taken along with them--not just to be a sex slave, but a domestic servant as well, Luz and other aid workers said. Often, they said, a captive woman would try to attach herself to one leader to avoid repeated gang rape. In a culture in which rape victims are often ostracized, such wholesale assaults were effective not only in spreading terror, but in breaking apart communities, social workers said. The first victims began telling their stories to the Rescue Committee when the aid group started reproductive health classes here several months ago, said counselor Dolly Williams. Last month, in an effort to refer the women for urgently needed medical attention and help them cope with their shame and humiliation, the Rescue Committee began documenting their stories. As word of the program spread, hundreds of women have come forward, waiting their turn patiently while Williams and Luz record the accounts of other victims. ""Child and women abductees and victims of gender violence are far too numerous, and we do not yet even have a clear picture as to how many there really are,"" said U.S. Ambassador Joseph H. Melrose Jr., who is trying to arrange for U.S. funds to help the victims. ""What is clear is that these victims and their injuries, both physical and psychological, must not be ignored. If these injuries do not heal, they will have implications for future generations of Sierra Leoneans and the success of the peace process."" Williams said the rate of sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea among the women is extremely high, a reflection of the 92 percent infection rate found among demobilized rebels. Neither the combatants nor the women are tested for AIDS or HIV infection because the cost is too great and there are no resources to treat anyone who tests positive. The first woman to arrive at the palm-thatched interview room one day last week was a 60-year-old who came to tell how she was grabbed in her village by a group of raiders because she was unable to outrun them. When they could not find any other women, she said, they raped her. ""I begged them not to,"" she said. ""I told them I was old, I could be their grandmother,"" but they did not listen; they just laughed at me. Afterward they let me go because I was old and useless. Now I have pain when I urinate. I have sores; I can't sleep."" A 35-year-old woman said she had been abducted and raped by four rebels in 1997. When they had finished, she said, they took her to their commander, who decided to keep her. She finally escaped three years later, during a firefight between the rebel unit and government troops. ""I can't have a man again,"" she told the interviewer. ""I have lost my life.""",2000,"Sierra Leone"
"25","A Woman's Work","Africa","Slaughter, and then worse, came to Butare, a sleepy, sun-bleached Rwandan town, in the spring of 1994. Hutu death squads armed with machetes and nail-studded clubs had deployed throughout the countryside, killing, looting and burning. Roadblocks had been set up to cull fleeing Tutsis. By the third week of April, as the Rwanda genocide was reaching its peak intensity, tens of thousands of corpses were rotting in the streets of Kigali, the country's capital. Butare, a stronghold of Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus that had resisted the government's orders for genocide, was the next target. Its residents could hear gunfire from the hills in the west; at night they watched the firelight of torched nearby villages. Armed Hutus soon gathered on the edges of town, but Butare's panicked citizens defended its borders. Enraged by Butare's revolt, Rwanda's interim government dispatched Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, the national minister of family and women's affairs, from Kigali on a mission. Before becoming one of the most powerful women in Rwanda's government, Pauline -- as everyone, enemy and ally alike, called her -- had grown up on a small farming commune just outside Butare. She was a local success story, known to some as Butare's favorite daughter. Her return would have a persuasive resonance there. Soon after Pauline's arrival in town, cars mounted with loudspeakers crisscrossed Butare's back roads, announcing that the Red Cross had arrived at a nearby stadium to provide food and guarantee sanctuary. By April 25, thousands of desperate Tutsis had gathered at the stadium. It was a trap. Instead of receiving food and shelter, the refugees were surrounded by men wearing bandoleers and headdresses made of spiky banana leaves. These men were Interahamwe, thuggish Hutu marauders whose name means ""those who attack together."" According to an eyewitness I spoke with this summer in Butare, supervising from the sidelines was Pauline, then 48, a portly woman of medium height in a colorful African wrap and spectacles. Before becoming Rwanda's chief official for women's affairs, Pauline was a social worker, roaming the countryside, offering lectures on female empowerment and instruction on child care and AIDS prevention. Her days as minister were similarly devoted to improving the lives of women and children. But at the stadium, a 30-year-old farmer named Foster Mivumbi told me, Pauline assumed a different responsibility. Mivumbi, who has confessed to taking part in the slaughter, told me that Pauline goaded the Interahamwe, commanding, ""Before you kill the women, you need to rape them."" Tutsi women were then selected from the stadium crowd and dragged away to a forested area to be raped, Mivumbi recalled. Back at the stadium, he told me, Pauline waved her arms and then observed in silence as Interahamwe rained machine-gun fire and hand grenades down upon the remaining refugees. The Hutus finished off survivors with machetes. It took about an hour, ending at noon. Pauline stayed on, Mivumbi told me, until a bulldozer began piling bodies for burial in a nearby pit. (When questioned about this incident, Pauline's lawyers denied that she took part in atrocities in Butare.) Shortly afterward, according to another witness, Pauline arrived at a compound where a group of Interahamwe was guarding 70 Tutsi women and girls. One Interahamwe, a young man named Emmanuel Nsabimana, told me through a translator that Pauline ordered him and the others to burn the women. Nsabimana recalled that one Interahamwe complained that they lacked sufficient gasoline. ""Pauline said, 'Don't worry, I have jerrycans of gasoline in my car,' "" Nsabimana recalled. ""She said, 'Go take that gasoline and kill them.' I went to the car and took the jerrycans. Then Pauline said, 'Why don't you rape them before you kill them?' But we had been killing all day, and we were tired. We just put the gasoline in bottles and scattered it among the women, then started burning."" Round the same time, some Interahamwe arrived at the local hospital, where a unit of Doctors Without Borders was in residence. Rose, a young Tutsi woman who had sought refuge at the hospital, watched in terror as soldiers stormed the complex. (Rose, who is now under military protection, requested that her last name not be printed.) ""They said that Pauline had given them permission to go after the Tutsi girls, who were too proud of themselves,"" Rose told me. ""She was the minister, so they said they were free to do it."" Pauline had led the soldiers to see rape as a reward. Chief among the Interahamwe at the hospital was Pauline's only son, a 24-year-old student named Arsene Shalom Ntahobali. Shalom, as he was known, was over six feet tall, slightly overweight and clean-shaven. He wore a track suit and sneakers; grenades dangled from his waist. Rose said that Shalom, who repeatedly announced that he had ""permission"" from his mother to rape Tutsis, found her cowering in the maternity ward. He yanked her to her feet and raped her against the wall. Before leaving Rose to chase after some students who had been hiding nearby, he promised that he'd return to kill her. But before Shalom could do so, she fled the hospital and ran home to her family. A few days later, Rose recalled, a local official knocked on her door. Rose told me that the official informed her that even though all Tutsis would be exterminated, one Tutsi would be left alive -- one who could deliver a progress report to God. Rose was to be that witness. And her instruction on her new role began that moment. ""Hutu soldiers took my mother outside,"" Rose told me, ""stripped off her clothes and raped her with a machete."" On that first day, 20 family members were slaughtered before her eyes. Rose told me that until early July, when the genocide ended, she was led by Interahamwe to witness atrocity after atrocity. She said that even though the Interahamwe's overarching objective was to kill, the men seemed particularly obsessed by what they did to women's bodies. ""I saw them rape two girls with spears then burn their pubic hair,"" she said. ""Then they took me to another spot where a lady was giving birth. The baby was halfway out. They speared it."" All the while, Rose repeatedly heard the soldiers say, ""We are doing what was ordered by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko."" I met Rose in Butare this summer. She is 32 now, a pretty woman with high cheekbones and small features. Speaking in an airless hotel room, Rose pitched slightly forward in a red business suit, her gaze direct. She explained that since the genocide she has suffered from stomach ulcers, and occasionally slips into semiconsciousness, racked with delirium and pain. ""People think I'm possessed,"" she said. These fits, she said, frighten her children -- her two born before 1994 and the four genocide orphans she adopted afterward. As we spoke, it was clear that Rose was telling her horrific story as carefully as possible, to finally fulfill, in a way much different from intended, her role as witness. Rose said that during the months the genocide was carried out, she saw Pauline Nyiramasuhuko three times. The minister was an unforgettable sight. She'd exchanged her colorful civilian wraps for brand-new military fatigues and boots. She was seen carrying a machine gun over her shoulder. Other survivors told me they heard the minister for women and family affairs spit invectives at Tutsi women, calling them ""cockroaches"" and ""dirt."" She advised the men to choose the young women for sex and kill off the old. By one account, women were forced to raise their shirts to separate the mothers from the ""virgins."" Sometimes, I was told, Pauline handed soldiers packets of condoms. Much of the violence took place in the scrubby yard in front of Butare's local government offices, or prefecture, where at one point hundreds of Tutsis were kept under guard. Witnesses recalled that Pauline showed up at night in a white Toyota pickup truck, often driven by Shalom, and supervised as Interahamwe loaded the truck with women who were driven off and never seen again. Often, when a woman at the prefecture saw Pauline, she appealed to her, as a fellow woman and mother, for mercy. But this, claimed survivors, only enraged Pauline. When one woman wouldn't stop crying out, a survivor recalled, the minister told the Interahamwe to shut her up. They stabbed the pleading woman and then slit her throat. There will never be a precise accounting of how many Rwandans were massacred between April and July 1994. Human Rights Watch calculates the number to be at least 500,000, while the United Nations estimates that between 800,000 and one million Rwandans died during that period. Whatever the total, the rate of carnage and the concentration of the killing (Rwanda is roughly the size of New Jersey) give it the distinction of being the most ferocious mass slaughter in recorded history. Three-quarters of the Tutsi population was exterminated. Today, Rwanda's common greeting, the Kinyarwanda expression mwaramutse -- which translates as ""did you wake?"" -- is less an expression of ""good morning"" than it is of relief that one is breathing at all. Understandably, the world's attention subsequently focused on the sheer volume of the Rwandan slaughter. But the prosecutors and judges of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, are now coming to recognize the equally alarming and cynical story of what was left behind. Though most women were killed before they could tell their stories, a U.N. report has concluded that at least 250,000 women were raped during the genocide. Some were penetrated with spears, gun barrels, bottles or the stamens of banana trees. Sexual organs were mutilated with machetes, boiling water and acid; women's breasts were cut off. According to one study, Butare province alone has more than 30,000 rape survivors. Many more women were killed after they were raped. These facts are harrowing. More shocking still is that so many of these crimes were supposedly inspired and orchestrated by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, whose very job was the preservation, education and empowerment of Rwanda's women. In July 1994 Pauline fled Rwanda in a mass exodus of more than one million Hutus fearing retribution by the advancing Tutsi rebel army, the Rwandan Patriotic Front. After finding safety in a refugee camp in Congo, she eventually slipped into Kenya, where she lived as a fugitive for almost three years. On July 18, 1997, however, Pauline was apprehended in Nairobi by Kenyan and international authorities. (Shalom was seized six days later, in a Nairobi grocery store he was running.) After interrogation by investigators, Pauline was transferred with Shalom to Tanzania, where both were delivered to the International Tribunal in Arusha. At the tribunal, Pauline faces 11 charges, including genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. She is the first woman ever to be charged with these crimes in an international court. And she is the first woman ever to be charged with rape as a crime against humanity. (Her son, Shalom, faces 10 charges, to which he has pled innocence.) For the last five years mother and son have spent their days at the U.N. Detention Facility in Arusha in nearby 16-by-19 cells. They have access to a gym and a nurse. Pauline often spends time tending flowers and singing to herself in a common open-air courtyard. Since June 2001, when their trials began, Pauline and Shalom have spent most of their weekdays in a courtroom inside Arusha's dilapidated conference center. The U.N. Security Council established the Arusha tribunal in November 1994, 18 months after establishing a tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague. With all of Rwanda's judicial and law-enforcement personnel dead or in exile, and the country's physical infrastructure reduced to rubble, the U.N. chose to house the tribunal in this tourist hub near the base of Mount Kilimanjaro. Fifty-three Rwandan genocidaires are in custody in Arusha; 20 more have been indicted and are on the lam, most likely in Kenya and Congo. This summer, I attended sessions of Pauline's trial. In court, her appearance suggested a schoolteacher. Now 56, she favored plain high-necked dresses that showed off the gleaming gold crucifix she usually wears. According to observers, at the beginning of the trial she shook her head and smirked as charges were read out. But as more and more survivors have come from Butare to testify against her, she has grown subdued. During my visit, Pauline mostly looked blankly around the courtroom past a pair of scholarly bifocals, taking copious notes on a legal pad and avoiding the gaze of witnesses. Sometimes, I was told, she wears wild hairstyles and headdresses and slumps behind a computer screen that sits in front of her, as if she were trying to disguise herself from witnesses asked to identify her. On one such day 11 months ago, she didn't show up at all, preferring, her attorneys told the court, to worship in chapel; that morning, when asked to identify the defendant, the witness could point only to Pauline's chair. The courtroom is typically crowded with three judges, 12 defense attorneys and prosecutors, clerks, interpreters and other staff. Most days there are only a handful of spectators watching all this in a narrow gallery behind bulletproof glass -- and frequently there are none at all. Pauline and Shalom are being tried together with four other Hutu leaders from Butare who are also accused of genocide. Fourteen witnesses for the prosecution have testified so far, with 73 more still to go, most of whom will have something to say against Pauline, who faces life imprisonment. In most cases, she is accused of inciting crimes rather than carrying them out herself. However, according to a document prepared by tribunal investigators in preparation for the trial, one witness, code-named Q.C., saw a Tutsi community leader die ""at the hands of Nyiramasuhuko."" (The report does not specify what weapon Pauline used.) Attorneys for each of the six accused will most likely open their defenses in 2004 and will probably call more than 100 witnesses of their own as the trial creeps along for at least another two years. Justice at the tribunal has moved at a glacial pace, with only eight convictions and one acquittal handed down in seven years. Pauline has consistently denied the charges against her. In 1995, before she was arrested, she gave an interview to the BBC in a squalid Hutu refugee camp across the Congo border, where she had been leading the camp's social services; her job duties included the reuniting of separated parents and children. When asked what she did during the war, Pauline replied: ""We moved around the region to pacify. We wrote a pacification document saying people shouldn't kill each other. Saying it's genocide, that's not true. It was the Tutsi who massacred the Hutu."" Told that witnesses had accused her of murder, Pauline shot back: ""I cannot even kill a chicken. If there is a person who says that a woman -- a mother -- killed, then I'll confront that person."" Over lunch during a break in court this summer, one of Pauline's attorneys, Nicole Bergevin, accused the Tribunal of making her client a scapegoat of the vindictive current government in Rwanda and of an international community guilt-ridden over its failure to stop the bloodletting. ""I'm sure there were some rapes,"" Bergevin said, ""but Pauline never ordered any rapes."" Later she added: ""She was never known to be anti-Tutsi. I'm not saying that no one wanted the Tutsis to be exterminated. Probably there were, but it was not a plan. It was never the government's intention. If it was, Pauline was not aware of it."" Bergevin then told me that Pauline didn't have any knowledge about the rapes taking place in Rwanda during the genocide. Pauline has only one concern, Bergevin said, and it is for Shalom, who like his mother, faces life imprisonment. ""She feels helpless,"" Bergevin said. My many requests to see Pauline were denied. The tribunal bars prisoners from contact with anyone other than family and friends (and even these visits are limited). I did, though, reach Pauline's husband, Maurice Ntahobari, who at the time of the genocide was the rector of National University in Butare. He now lives in Antwerp, Belgium; his Rwandan passport has been taken away. Though he admits to being in Butare during the genocide, Ntahobari insists he didn't see or hear any killing. As for the charges against Pauline, he reminded me that she had been a social worker. ""She was committed to promoting equality between men and women,"" he said defiantly. ""It is not culturally possible for a Rwandan woman to make her son rape other women. It just couldn't have taken place."" Pauline's only error, he insisted, was in belonging to the side that lost. Pauline Nyiramasuhuko was born in 1946 amid lush banana groves and green, misty valleys. Her parents were subsistence farmers in Ndora, a small, neat roadside settlement six miles east of Butare. Her family and friends remember her as more ambitious and disciplined than bright. Her sister, Vineranda Mukandekaze, who is 60, told me that Pauline was ""good but not generous. She kept everything to herself."" Juliana Niyirora, an old friend of Pauline's, said: ""From her childhood Pauline had political ambition. She always wanted to achieve high. If she saw someone build a house, she wanted a bigger house. If she saw someone do well, she wanted to do better."" In high school, Pauline became friends with Agathe Kanziga, the eventual wife of the Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana. It was a crucial connection. After graduating, Pauline left Butare for Kigali to join the Ministry for Social Affairs, which was then establishing a network of centers teaching women how to take care of their families, providing instruction on such basics as cooking and supervising children. When Pauline was only 22, Agathe helped her skip up the bureaucratic ladder to become national inspector of the ministry. In 1968 Pauline married Maurice Ntahobari, who later became president of the Rwanda National Assembly, then minister of higher education and later rector of National University in Butare. By all accounts, however, Pauline was the dominant force in the family. ""Maurice was like the woman; he didn't say anything,"" said Jean-Baptist Sebukangaga, a professor of art at National University who has known Pauline since her childhood. ""Pauline directed everything. She got Maurice his job as rector at the university."" A friend and neighbor told me that she once saw Pauline screaming at Maurice for not being more committed to the politics of the MRND, the ruling Hutu extremist party. At 24, nine months pregnant, Pauline, already the mother of a little girl, traveled to Israel on a government mission and gave birth to a son there. (Hence, Shalom.) She returned to Kigali, where in the years that followed she had two more daughters. But Pauline never gave up her job and eventually enrolled in law school, one of the few women in Rwanda to do so. ""She had four children, but she still wanted to go back to school,"" her friend Niyirora marveled. Already a local MRND party boss, in 1992 she was appointed minister of family and women's affairs. Pauline's brother-in-law, Matthias Ngiwijize, told me that when Pauline became a government minister, she changed. ""She stopped coming to her family's homes,"" he said. ""She didn't talk to anybody. She was only close to herself. She resented the poor part of the family. She even stopped visiting her mother."" A woman eager to prove herself in a party structure built around men and Rwanda's patriarchal society, Pauline soon found that the road to political success led her back to her birthplace. Butare had become the government's biggest headache. Home to National University and a scientific-research institute -- and with the highest concentration of Tutsis in Rwanda -- Butare had the most enlightened citizens in the country. The town had been largely immune to Hutu extremism; the MRND never gained a foothold there. But Pauline tried to change all that through a program of intimidation. She would convoy through town with party thugs, setting up barricades in the streets, paralyzing traffic and disrupting town life. Pauline's periodic invasions of the town became known as Ghost Days, days when Butare stood still. Pauline was soon caught up in the anti-Tutsi ideology of her party. ""Before 1994 there was no racism in Butare,"" said Leoncie Mukamisha, an old schoolmate of Pauline's who worked under her at the ministry. ""Then Pauline came and organized demonstrations in town. The local papers described her as a frenzied madwoman."" Leoncie said that Pauline's actions won the favor of the president, who recognized her obedience and anti-Tutsi virulence, and assigned to her a number of extremist Hutu ideologues as advisers. Other friends I spoke with claimed that Pauline's anti-Tutsi conversion was a purely careerist move meant only to please the higher-ups. It was an echo of the old argument that many Nazis were ""just following orders."" Her sister told me that even in 1994, just before the genocide, Pauline had many Tutsi friends, and that a number of Tutsis worked peacefully under Pauline at the ministry. Leoncie portrayed her differently. She said Pauline's racism was ardent; at the ministry, she said, Pauline was ""horrified at having to be in daily contact with Tutsis."" And a former Hutu political figure who met Pauline in 1992 says that in private discussions, her antipathy toward Tutsis was chillingly clear. ""When one spoke with her, one became aware that the Tutsi were people to be destroyed,"" he said. It may never be possible to answer what motivated Pauline's actions. She may have genuinely felt rage toward Tutsis; she may have been a simple opportunist, hungering for power. But certainly by 1994, her anti-Tutsi zealousness was public. During the genocide Pauline delivered admonishing speeches over Radio Rwanda. A witness recalled one speech: ""We are all members of the militia,"" Pauline said. ""We must work together to hunt down members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front."" In his confession to genocide and crimes against humanity, former Hutu Prime Minister Jean Kambanda identifies the members of his inner sanctum, where the blueprint of the genocide was first drawn up. The confession names only five names. Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's is one of them. During my visit to Butare this summer, two young women, Mary Mukangoga, 24, and Chantal Kantarama, 28, led me into the center of Butare to the prefecture, where they first met and became friends. ""I went to the prefecture because other refugees were there,"" Mary said in a near whisper. ""I preferred to be killed when we were all together."" In the first weeks of the genocide, Chantal said, she had been abducted and raped by two Hutu men. She escaped and took refuge at a school near the prefecture. One day, Chantal recalled, she heard Pauline announcing through a microphone: ""I have a problem. The cockroaches are now near my house. Tomorrow come and help me. Help me get rid of them."" Chantal fled to the prefecture. The next day, Chantal said, Pauline visited the prefecture with Shalom. Mother and son came with the young men of the Interahamwe and selected girls to rape. In silence, Mary and Chantal led me to the ruins of what was once a plastics factory, in a shady grove of trees 200 yards from the prefecture office. They explained that the Interahamwe used to store their ammunition in the factory, and that many evenings they were taken from the prefecture, led there and raped. ""Pauline would come and say, 'I don't want this dirt here, get rid of this dirt,""' Chantal recalled. The two young women became part of a group of five sex slaves who were kept at the prefecture and raped, repeatedly and together, every night for weeks. Then one day, the women were thrown into a nearby pit that was full of corpses. The pit, about 400 feet square, is now half-filled in with rubble and weeds. Chantal took me there, stepping to the edge; at that point she turned aside, refusing to look in. ""They used machetes to kill the ones who resisted and dumped them into the hole,"" she explained. She began to weep. She remained inside the pit for a night and a day, she said; then, on the second night, she climbed the jumbled corpses to pull herself out. I took Chantal back to her home, a neat mud hut in a bustling, dusty neighborhood of shops and wandering livestock. Chantal is married with two children; she was the only genocidal-rape survivor I met who was married. Her husband knows what happened to her. But for thousands of Rwandan survivors, one of the most insidious legacies of the rapes is the stigma -- and the inevitable isolation. In Rwandan society, it is almost impossible for a woman who is known to have been raped to marry. One witness who testified against Pauline in Arusha had been engaged to be married a month later. When her fiance heard about the testimony, he broke off the engagement. Then there is the generation of children born of the rapes. As many as 5,000 such children have been documented and, most likely, there are many more than that who haven't. These children will most likely never know their fathers -- in most cases, the mother was raped so many times that the issue of paternity was not only pointless but emotionally perilous: in effect, all of her attackers had fathered that child. Compounding the dishonor, the mere sight of these children -- those who aren't abandoned -- can bring on savage memories to survivors. Two women I met who gave birth to their rapists' children named the children with words that translate as ""Blessing From God"" as a way to ease the pain. But others in the community gave them names that put them in the same category as their fathers: ""Children of Shame,"" ""Gifts of the Enemy,"" ""Little Interahamwe."" ""Did you ever see the look in a woman's eyes when she sees a child of rape?"" asked Sydia Nduna, an adviser at the International Rescue Committee Rwanda who works for a program in Kigali aimed at reducing gender violence. ""It's a depth of sadness you cannot imagine."" The impact of the mass rapes in Rwanda, she said, will be felt for generations. ""Mass rape forces the victims to live with the consequences, the damage, the children,"" Nduna explained. Making matters worse, the rapes, most of them committed by many men in succession, were frequently accompanied by other forms of physical torture and often staged as public performances to multiply the terror and degradation. So many women feared them that they often begged to be killed instead. Often the rapes were in fact a prelude to murder. But sometimes the victim was not killed but instead repeatedly violated and then left alive; the humiliation would then affect not only the victim but also those closest to her. Other times, women were used as a different kind of tool: half-dead, or even already a corpse, a woman would be publicly raped as a way for Interahamwe mobs to bond together. But the exposure -- and the destruction -- did not stop with the act of rape itself. Many women were purposely left alive to die later, and slowly. Two women I met outside Butare, Francina Mukamazina and Liberata Munganyinka, are dying of AIDS they contracted through rape. ""My biggest worry is what will happen to my children when I'm gone,"" Francina told me. These children are as fragile as Francina fears: a U.N. survey of Rwandan children of war concluded that 31 percent witnessed a rape or sexual assault, and 70 percent witnessed murder. Francina's and Liberata's daughters survived but watched their siblings slaughtered and their mothers violated. They will grow up beside children born of rape, all of them together forced to navigate different but commingling resentments. During my visit to Chantal's home, I asked her how she coped with her savage memories. She replied: ""I just want to forget. My children are my consolation. Most rape survivors have nothing. We're poor, but I have my family. It's all I want."" I found Mary later that afternoon a few miles of dirt track away. She was sitting alone in her home, a stifling mud hut about 20 feet square with one small window. Mary told me that the rapes were her first and only sexual experience. Then, eyes averted, twisting her hands, she told me that five months ago she discovered she had AIDS. She said that two of the other young women she and Chantal were kept with are already dead. Their fate is not the exception but the rule. According to one estimate, 70 percent of women raped during the Rwanda genocide have H.I.V.; most will eventually die from it. In an interview at the State House in Kigali, Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, talked about the mass rapes in measured, contemplative sentences, shaking his head, his emotions betraying him. ""We knew that the government was bringing AIDS patients out of the hospitals specifically to form battalions of rapists,"" he told me. He smiled ruefully, as if still astonished by the plan. The most cynical purpose of the rapes in Butare was to transmit a slower, more agonizing form of death. ""By using a disease, a plague, as an apocalyptic terror, as biological warfare, you're annihilating the procreators, perpetuating the death unto the generations,"" said Charles B. Strozier, a psychoanalyst and professor of history at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. ""The killing continues and endures."" The use of AIDS as a tool of warfare against Tutsi women helped prosecutors in Arusha focus on rape as a driving force of the genocide. ""H.I.V. infection is murder,"" said Silvana Arbia, the Rwanda Tribunal's acting chief of prosecutions. ""Sexual aggression is as much an act of genocide as murder is."" During my visit with Mary, I learned that she had been ""murdered"" in just this way. This young woman has only one relative who lived through the genocide, a younger brother who lives in Kigali. ""All of my friends have AIDS,"" she told me in June. ""But I'll die of loneliness before I die of AIDS,"" she whispered, choking on her tears. ""All I wanted was to marry and have a family."" Today, she lies gravely ill in her hut, cared for by Chantal, withering away. Mass rape has long been a weapon of war. According to legend, ancient Rome was united after Romulus and his soldiers terrorized their rivals, the Sabines, by raping their women. Widespread sexual assault has been documented in conflicts ranging from the Crusades to the Napoleonic Wars. It was Abraham Lincoln who approved the laws that eventually established the modern understanding of rape as a war crime. In 1863, he commissioned Francis Lieber, an expert jurist, to develop a set of instructions for governing armies during the Civil War. Lieber specifically named rape as a crime serious enough to be subject to the death penalty. ""The Lieber code was revolutionary,"" said Kelly Askin, director of the International Criminal Justice Institute. ""Before, gender crimes had been very much ignored."" International law was more reticent about the problem. ""Rape was considered a kind of collateral damage,"" said Rhonda Copelon, a professor of law at CUNY. ""It was seen as part of the unpreventable, fundamental culture of war."" After World War II, the rapes of Chinese women by Japanese soldiers in Nanking were prosecuted as war crimes by an international tribunal. However, rape was prosecuted only in conjunction with other violent crimes. The same tribunal, moreover, failed to prosecute the most institutionalized form of sexual violence, the enslavement of ""comfort women"" by the Japanese Army. In 1946, rape was named a crime against humanity by an Allied statute governing German war-crimes trials, but the law was never implemented. It was not until 1995, at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, that rape was prosecuted as a grave crime tantamount to torture. The defendant in that 1995 case was a Serbian policeman named Dusan Tadic. The tribunal charged him with various crimes, including the rape of a Muslim woman in a Bosnian prison camp. The rape was labeled a crime against humanity. So was another sexual crime, this one perpetrated against men. Tadic tortured two male Muslim prisoners, forcing one man to bite off the testicles of another, who then bled to death. The tribunal's indictments set an important precedent. Disappointingly, tribunal prosecutors were forced to drop the rape charge after Tadic's victim refused to testify -- she was afraid of reprisal if she did so. The prosecutors were successful, however, with the sexual-mutilation charge. Convicted of torture, among other crimes, Tadic was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Individual stories of rape in Rwanda had begun to accumulate as soon as the genocide ended, mostly through interviews collected by groups like Human Rights Watch. But because Rwandan culture discourages women from talking about sexual matters -- and also because the idea that rape was merely ""collateral damage"" remained ingrained in the judicial community -- the prosecutors in Arusha did not initially connect the dots between rape and the Hutus' genocide blueprint. The legal breakthrough came by a willful accident, during the 1998 trial in Arusha of Jean Paul Akayesu, mayor of Taba, a Rwandan commune. Initially, Akayesu had been charged only with genocide. Among the survivors who testified against him was a woman code-named H. (The identities of tribunal witnesses are shielded.) ""H. disclosed to me prior to her going on the stand that she was raped out in the bush,"" explained Pierre-Richard Prosper, the current U.S. ambassador at large for war-crimes issues, who led the tribunal's prosecution against Akayesu. ""She said that the Interahamwe would come in at the end of the day and start raping the women, and that Akayesu was there."" Sensing a window into not just the act of H.'s rape but the intention of her rapists, Prosper dispatched investigators to Rwanda, specifically to find women who were raped in Taba during the third and fourth weeks of April. Of the 500 or so women they knew had been held captive, investigators discovered that almost all had been killed and dumped in a mass grave. Witness H. was one of about a dozen who was able to escape. So was a woman code-named J.J. Prosper put J.J. on the stand. Her tale was sickeningly familiar: she said she had been dragged away by Interahamwe and raped repeatedly. Then she mentioned that Akayesu watched her being raped from the doorway and goaded the Interahamwe, saying with a laugh, ""Never ask me again what a Tutsi woman tastes like."" The indictment against Akayesu was amended to include the first-ever charge of rape as a crime against humanity. Prosper argued that Akayesu, in making that flip remark as the Interahamwe proceeded with raping J.J., was effectively ordering them to continue raping others. On Sept. 2, 1998, Akayesu was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity, including rape. He was sentenced to three life sentences, plus 80 years imprisonment, and transferred to a U.N.-sponsored prison in Mali, in West Africa. ""The intention in Rwanda was an abstraction: to kill without killing,"" said Arbia, the tribunal prosecutor. She described the case of a 45-year-old Rwandan woman who was raped by her 12-year-old son -- with Interahamwe holding a hatchet to his throat -- in front of her husband, while their five other young children were forced to hold open her thighs. ""The offense against an individual woman becomes an offense against the family,"" Arbia said, ""which becomes an offense against the country, and so, by deduction, against humanity."" On Aug. 10, 1999, a year after Akayesu's conviction, Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's indictment was amended to include rape as a crime against humanity. According to prosecutors and witnesses, her frequent instructions to Interahamwe at the prefecture to rape before they killed, or to rape women instead of killing them, had triggered a collective sadism in Butare -- one that had even inspired violence in the local peasants. One Tutsi rape survivor I met in Butare, a farmer named Suzanne Bukabangwa, had never met Pauline, but became her victim by extension all the same. Her neighbors, uneducated farmers, had kept her as a sex slave during the genocide, she said, torturing her nightly. She remembered two things most of all: the stamens from the banana trees they used to violate her, leaving her body mutilated, and the single sentence one of the men used: ""We're going to kill all the Tutsis, and one day Hutu children will have to ask what did a Tutsi child look like."" In Butare, I spoke to a local peasant, Lucien Simbayobewe, who was caught up in this cycle of humiliation. Now 40, he was being held prisoner in the local prison. (Only leaders of the genocide have been sent to Arusha.) He wore the pink shorts and matching pink shirt of the Rwandan inmate's uniform. Wringing his hands in his lap, he told me about one woman he killed who still comes to him every night in his dreams. He couldn't remember this apparition's name, but he said he'd killed her when Pauline first organized the Butare Interahamwe. Choking on emotion, he said, ""She comes in the night dancing and gesturing with her hands invitingly, like a lover."" My translator gyrated her arms to show me the motion. ""The woman smiles, and says, 'How are you?' But before I can answer, she says, 'Goodbye,' and then she vanishes -- and I wake up."" Lucien then told me in detail about killing her. But when I asked Lucien if he'd raped the woman, he fell silent and fought back tears. Every prisoner I spoke with described explicitly whom he killed and how. Not a single one admitted to raping a Tutsi woman. Perhaps this is because after the war, Rwanda's Legislature declared that rapes committed during the genocide were the highest category of crime; those convicted are sentenced to death. Or maybe these men could somehow justify to themselves having murdered but not raped. In any event, the weight of that level of confession was obviously too much to bear, and if there could be any tangible proof that rape was considered the more shameful crime, it was this. Some scholars are beginning to share this opinion. ""Rape sets in motion continuous suffering and extreme humiliation that affects not just the individual victim but everyone around her,"" said the philosopher and historian Robert Jay Lifton, who in books like ""The Nazi Doctors"" has explored the psychology of genocide. ""A woman is seen as a symbol of purity. The family revolves around that symbol. Then here is the brutal attack on that, stigmatizing them all. All this perpetuates the humiliation, reverberating among survivors and their whole families."" He paused. ""In this way, rape is worse than death."" Gerald Gahima, Rwanda's prosecutor general, agrees. ""Rape was the worst experience of victims of the genocide,"" he said. ""Some people paid to die, to be shot rather than tortured. Their prayers were for a quick and decent death. Victims of rape did not have that privilege."" The case against Pauline further cements the precedent established in the Akayesu trial: namely, that inciting mass rape is a crime against humanity. But Pauline's case transcends jurisprudence. She presents to the world a new kind of criminal. ""There is a shared concept across cultures that women don't do this kind of thing,"" said Carolyn Nordstrom, an anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame. ""Society doesn't yet have a way to talk about it, because it violates all our concepts of what women are."" I found Pauline's mother, Theresa Nyirakabue, on the same plot of land in Ndora where Pauline was born and reared. Directly across the road is one of the many orderly settlements of sturdy homes the government built for Tutsi survivors of the genocide. Theresa is 86, diminutive and half-blind, and keeps upright by grasping a tall staff. But her milky eyes are electric, her smile is quick and she was eager to invite strangers into her home to talk about her daughter. She hadn't seen Pauline since the genocide began and was hungry for news of her. I asked her if she knew that Pauline was in detention in Arusha, and she nodded. I asked her if she knew why, and she nodded again. Then I said that I saw Pauline three weeks before in the courtroom and that she looked healthy enough. Smiling broadly, Theresa said: ""Pauline wanted to teach at the health center. She liked to teach good health."" She paused, still smiling, and said, ""Pauline's ministership was the joy of my heart."" I asked her if she thought her daughter was innocent of the charges against her. Theresa sobered instantly. ""It is unimaginable that she did these things,"" she said. ""She wouldn't order people to rape and kill. After all, Pauline is a mother."" Then Theresa leaned forward, her hands outstretched. ""Before the war, Hutu and Tutsi were the same,"" she said. She told me that Pauline had many Tutsi friends. Theresa added that during the genocide, she herself had hidden a Tutsi boy in her home. At first, Theresa's story took me by surprise. But then, Rwanda's lethal racialism could never be as starkly delineated as, say, Nazi Germany's. Whether Hutus and Tutsis are separate ethnic groups is a subject of debate, but it was only after European colonists arrived in Rwanda that any political distinction was made between them. Intermarriage had long been common, and both groups spoke the same language and practiced the same religion. Around the turn of the 20th century, however, German and Belgian colonists used dubious racialist logic -- namely, that Tutsis had a more ""Caucasian"" appearance -- to designate the minority Tutsi the ruling class, empowering them as their social and governing proxy. In the 1930's, the Belgians, deciding to limit administrative posts and higher education to the Tutsi, needed to decide exactly who was who in Rwanda. The most efficient procedure was simply to register everyone and require them to carry cards identifying them as one or the other. Eighty-four percent of the population declared themselves Hutu and 15 percent Tutsi. Considering the degree of intermarriage in Rwandan history, this accounting was hardly scientific. What's more, Rwandans sometimes switched ethnic identities, the wealthy relabeling themselves as Tutsis and the poor as Hutus. ""Identity became based on what you could get away with,"" said Alison Des Forges, a senior adviser to the African Division of Human Rights Watch who has studied Rwanda for 30 years. ""Half of the people are not clearly distinguishable. There was significant intermarriage. Women who fit the Tutsi stereotype -- taller, lighter, with more Caucasian-like features -- became desirable. But it didn't necessarily mean that the women were one or the other."" With desire comes its emotional alter ego, resentment. A revolution in 1959 brought the majority Hutus to power. As tensions increased around 1990, politicians began disseminating propaganda denouncing Tutsi females as temptresses, whores and sexual deviants. Before the 1994 genocide began, Hutu newspapers ran cartoon after cartoon depicting Tutsi women as lascivious seducers. Unlike the Nazis, who were fueled by myths of Aryan superiority, the Hutus were driven by an accumulated rage over their lower status and by resentment of supposed Tutsi beauty and arrogance. ""The propaganda made Tutsi women powerful, desirable -- and therefore something to be destroyed,"" Rhonda Copelon told me. ""When you make the woman the threat, you enhance the idea that violence against them is permitted."" This pernicious idea, of course, came to full fruition during the genocide. The collective belief of Hutu women that Tutsi women were shamelessly trying to steal their husbands granted Hutu men permission to rape their supposed competitors out of existence. Seen through this warped lens, the men who raped were engaged not only in an act of sexual transgression but also in a purifying ritual. ""Once women are defiled as a group, anything one does to them is done in some kind of higher purpose,"" Robert Jay Lifton said. ""It becomes a profound, shared motivation of eliminating evil. Tutsis must be killed down to the last person in order to bring about utopia. They are seen, in a sense, as already dead."" This explanation conformed with my sense of Pauline's view of the Tutsis; like many of her countrymen, she seemed able to view individual Tutsis as abstractions. But in my conversations with Pauline's mother, things became even more complicated. After Theresa told me about the Tutsi boy she had hidden, she paused, looked at me intently and told me, matter-of-factly, that Pauline's great-grandfather was a Tutsi. The great-grandfather had been redesignated a Hutu, Theresa explained, because he became poor. Stunned, and knowing that in Rwanda kinship is defined patrilineally -- through the blood of fathers -- I asked Theresa if that didn't mean that Pauline was a Tutsi. ""Yes, of course,"" she said eagerly. And would Pauline have known that she came from Tutsi lineage? Theresa pursed her lips and gave a firm, affirmative nod. The young man Theresa hid was not difficult to find. His name is Dutera Agide, 36, a jobless handyman in Ndora. He told me that he is Pauline's second cousin, and that he is a Tutsi. He said he had spent one week hiding in Theresa's house, listening to the slaughter going on outside. Then he said something even more surprising. At one point, he said, he was hidden in Pauline's house. ""I saw Pauline twice a week during the genocide,"" Dutera told me. ""One day she came home, and she said: 'The war is not ending. I'm starting to get afraid. I don't know what will happen.' Then she came back again with her husband, loaded things from the house into a car and left. She looked scared."" After my conversation with Dutera, I went back to Theresa's home one more time. Her exuberance had all but gone. She seemed to have settled into the truth, or a form of it. ""People killed people because of fear to be also killed by the perpetrators of the genocide,"" she said. ""My daughter, who was also a minister in the government, could have participated in the killing not because she wanted to kill but because of fear."" Theresa then used the Kinyarwanda expression Mpemuke ndamuke: ""to be dishonest in order to escape death."" I spoke again with Pauline's sister, Vineranda. ""In 1959, when the Tutsi regime changed, our family changed with the situation,"" Vineranda explained. ""Because she was a Tutsi, Pauline was afraid that maybe the government would find out. And she was among many men in the government. And she had money and a position. She didn't want to lose that."" Robert Jay Lifton was intrigued by the revelation that Pauline was of Tutsi descent. ""Part of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's fierceness had to do with eliminating the Tutsi in her,"" he hypothesized. ""She was undergoing an individual struggle to destroy that defiled element in herself."" Pauline's husband, Maurice Ntahobari, denied irritably that there were Tutsi roots in either his or Pauline's family. After being asked repeatedly about Pauline's and Shalom's actions during the genocide, he sighed and said: ""Try to understand, try to be in my shoes. This is about my wife and my son."" When I spoke again with Pauline's attorney, Nicole Bergevin, in July, and told her what Pauline's mother had told me about Pauline being of Tutsi descent, Bergevin said she knew. (In an odd reversal, she later denied that Pauline was Tutsi.) Bergevin's demeanor had changed since we had last spoken. This time around, she sounded defeated. Though she still insisted that Pauline knew nothing of the mass raping or murdering, she said, ""I'm sure she's going to be found guilty."" Then she paused and said with resignation, ""When you do murder trials, you realize that we are all susceptible, and you wouldn't even dream that you would ever commit this act."" There was a short silence. ""But you come to understand that everyone is. It could happen to me, it could happen to my daughter. It could happen to you."" The crimes Pauline Nyiramasuhuko are accused of are monstrous. Her capacity for pity and compassion, and her professional duty to shield the powerless, deserted her, or collapsed under the irresistible urge for power. But in seeking a reasonable explanation for Pauline's barbarity, I remembered something that Alison Des Forges of Human Rights Watch told me. ""This behavior lies just under the surface of any of us,"" Des Forges said. ""The simplified accounts of genocide allow distance between us and the perpetrators of genocide. They are so evil we couldn't ever see ourselves doing the same thing. But if you consider the terrible pressure under which people were operating, then you automatically reassert their humanity -- and that becomes alarming. You are forced to look at these situations and say, 'What would I have done?' Sometimes the answer is not encouraging."" Pauline did possess humanity, but it was in short supply, and she reserved it for her only son, Shalom, whom she had helped turn into a rapist and a killer. In one of her last moments as an engineer of the genocide, however, she returned to her role as woman and mother. It was in July 1994, right when the Hutu Army was collapsing. Butare had descended into mayhem, and Pauline's side had lost. One of Pauline's neighbors, Lela, spotted the minister in the streets. ""I saw Pauline and Shalom at a roadblock,"" she said. ""Pauline was wearing military fatigues, and she was still trying to separate Tutsis and Hutus, but the confusion was massive. There were people running everywhere. The Rwandan Patriotic Front was coming."" A short time later, Lela saw Pauline again. This time she was standing alone outside her home, looking worried. ""I was shocked,"" Lela said. ""She was wearing camouflage. She was standing upright in her uniform like a soldier, trying to see what was happening up and down the road. She just looked furious. She was looking everywhere for Shalom. He was her pet. She loved Shalom so much.""",2002,"Rwanda"
"26","Woman Who Sought U.S. Asylum Is Arrested","Africa","A West African woman whose plea for political asylum drew national attention after she said she feared genital mutilation in Ghana was arrested in Queens yesterday on charges that she lied under oath and entered the United States with a fraudulent passport in 1997. The charges reopened a tangled battle that drew interest from political figures, celebrities and women's groups two years ago. Some of them angered immigration officials by asserting that the government had opposed her asylum application because of hostility to asylum claims by women who said they were at risk of genital mutilation in their home countries. But in their charges yesterday, federal prosecutors said the account of the woman, Regina Norman Danson, 33, was an invention, including her claim that she was in line to become ""queen mother"" of her tribe in central Ghana. Because she would fail the tribe's requirement of virginity, she told officials in 1997, she would be mutilated or killed if she were sent home. The Immigration and Naturalization Service opposed her request, but a federal appeals court granted her asylum in 1999. James B. Comey, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said yesterday that the indictment ""demonstrates that the government will not tolerate cynical abuse of the asylum system."" But a lawyer for Ms. Danson, Kenneth J. Montgomery, said she was indeed a member of a royal family in her tribe and reiterated that she would have faced genital mutilation or death if she were sent home. ""Of course she told the truth,"" Mr. Montgomery told reporters after Ms. Danson pleaded not guilty. He asserted that the charges were motivated by officials angered that the appeals court had ruled against them on her asylum claim. The nine-count indictment yesterday included charges of perjury, which could bring a prison term of five years, and passport fraud, which could result in imprisonment of 10 years. Ms. Danson used the name of another immigrant from Ghana, Adelaide Abankwah, when she entered this country. She was released yesterday on $200,000 bail. The judge in the case, Charles P. Sifton, was abrupt with prosecutors, telling them they should be prepared to clarify ""whether or not this is a vindictive prosecution."" He also asked an assistant United States attorney, Ronnie Abrams, about the statute of limitations that can bar prosecution of a case. Many of Ms. Danson's statements that the prosecutors say included lies were made five years ago yesterday and those charges have a five-year statute of limitations. The charges were filed Friday but were not made public until yesterday. ""There are many questions about this indictment,"" Judge Sifton said to the prosecutors, ""which I think, at the appropriate time, you'll be asked to explain."" The case was handled by assistants of Mr. Comey. Ms. Danson was charged yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn because she was arrested in Queens, which is part of the court's district, and her trial is to be held in the Brooklyn court.",2002,"Ghana"

"30","World Briefing  Africa: South Africa: Apology For Unprotected Sex","Africa","  Newly acquitted of raping the daughter of a family friend, South Africa's former deputy president, Jacob G. Zuma, apologized for having unprotected sex with the H.I.V.-positive woman last November, saying he ''should have been more cautious and more responsible.'' But he bristled at the widespread criticism of his statement during the trial that he had showered after sex to minimize the chance of contracting H.I.V. Mr. Zuma said he had not stated that showers prevent AIDS, explaining that his behavior was an ''additional measure'' to ward off infection, akin to washing one's hands after peeling an onion. Mr. Zuma's statements on H.I.V. and women's sexual behavior were assailed by women's and AIDS activists but supported by many in South Africa's large Zulu population.

"31","S. Africans Rally Behind Embattled Politician; As Trial of Ex-Deputy President Opens, Supporters See Rape Charge as Part of Conspiracy","Africa","The women who danced and sang outside the Johannesburg High Court on Monday in support of former deputy president Jacob Zuma agreed on one thing: He's no rapist. The accuser, these supporters said on the first day of his trial, was part of a conspiracy. Or she was a frustrated girlfriend who wanted a commitment. Or she asked for money and was rebuffed. Whatever happened  --  and most said they believed Zuma and the woman had sex  --  did not fit their idea of rape. ""If he was raping her, why didn't she scream?"" said Lindiwe Cele, 42, a nurse from a dusty township southeast of Johannesburg, without a hint of doubt in her voice. ""Who heard her? There is no rape."" Zuma's legal troubles, including a corruption trial scheduled to begin in July, have opened deep rifts in South Africa's ruling African National Congress. They also have revealed sharply divergent ideas about what constitutes criminal sexual violence in a society with some of the world's highest rates of rape. Outside the downtown courtroom, as more than 1,000 people waved signs, stomped in rhythm and sported T-shirts bearing Zuma's smiling face, the very definition of rape seemed open to debate. A middle-aged man in an orange prison jumpsuit and rusty manacles shuffled down the street holding a sign that said: ""Jacob Zuma was raped."" Supporters repeated the line often on Monday, equating Zuma's ordeal  --  going from the front-runner for South Africa's presidency to the possibility of prison --  to the crime reported by more than 55,000 women nationwide last year. Women's rights activists say only 7 percent of reported rapes result in convictions in an average year. The plaintiff, her head covered with a scarf, slipped into court hours before the street rally turned raucous. She is a 31-year-old HIV-positive AIDS activist, the daughter of prominent ANC members and a Zuma family friend who was staying in his suburban Johannesburg home the night of the alleged attack in November. Among the evidence, according to news reports, are semen stains on her underwear that have been tested for Zuma's DNA. But as often happens in rape cases, no witnesses have come forward to back her account of that night, leaving room for Zuma's supporters to embrace alternative explanations. ""The community would have known about it,"" said Shon Mathye, a 19-year-old student, who said her support for Zuma was not shaken by the allegations. ""Women can't keep a secret to themselves."" Until legal trouble ensnared him last year, Zuma, 63, a former guerrilla leader with humble origins and a common touch, was among South Africa's most popular politicians. As a member of the nation's Zulu ethnic group that frequently battled with the African National Congress during the final years of apartheid, he was a vital peacemaker in apartheid's waning days. His support ran deepest among union members, socialists and the poor, many of whom regarded Zuma as more loyal to their issues than President Thabo Mbeki, who often is portrayed as a pipe-smoking academic uneasy with ordinary South Africans. Zuma's charismatic style, limited schooling and leftist politics worried some senior members of the ANC as they contemplated whom to back to become president in 2009, when Mbeki's second term ends. Mbeki's decision to fire Zuma as deputy president in June, after his financial adviser was convicted of having a ""generally corrupt relationship"" with Zuma, struck many backers as unfairly abrupt, given that Zuma had not yet faced charges of his own. Prosecutors then charged Zuma with corruption, but his support among rank-and-file ANC members appeared little diminished until the filing of rape charges in December. His most ardent followers dismissed those allegations as well, blaming them on a shadowy campaign to destroy Zuma. On Monday, supporters donned T-shirts saying, ""Innocent Until Proven Guilty!!!"" Another said, ""Support Jacob Zuma, Defend the Revolution."" Somebody else scrawled on a cardboard sign, ""We Love U Zuma."" With the backing of a truck-mounted sound system, the Zuma supporters easily drowned out several dozen demonstrators for women's rights with signs of their own: ""Against Her Will, Against the Law"" and ""Rape Is Always a Crime."" Halala Sibiya, 24, traveled 11 hours from her village to dance in support of Zuma because of the aid of his charitable foundation, which she works for, in buying school uniforms, paying school fees and distributing food packages to the hungry. Sibiya blamed the ANC leadership and what she regarded as a clique from the Xhosa ethnic group for the rape charges. ""They're against him,"" Sibiya said. ""He's a Zulu."" In a brief interview Sunday, after a rally in the northern mining city of Rustenberg, Zuma attributed his enduring popularity to the belief that he had been wronged. ""They have a problem with the manner in which things have been done to me,"" he said. ""They know me,"" Zuma added. ""I don't think they believe I'm a criminal."" At that rally, miner Nombalela Maollolo, 34, said Zuma was loyal to the causes she cherished, including the right of women to work what are traditionally men's jobs in mine shafts instead of being confined to office work or other tasks. ""Although he has these problems, we know he'll fight for us heavy and hard,"" Maollolo said as she danced in half-filled stands. At Monday's rally, Louisa Tshivhasa, 72, who wore an Mbeki button on her dress and an ANC scarf around her neck, also tried to accommodate both her affection for Zuma and support for women. She walked over to the women's rights demonstrators, picked up a sign that said, ""Speak Out!"" and joined in their songs. ""There is nothing wrong with that,"" she said, seeing no conflict in the causes. ""We are both one thing.""",2006,"South Africa"
"32","Drawing a Line Between Enduring Harm and Legitimate Fear","Africa","Online: Court documents and an archive of Adam Liptak's articles: nytimes.com/adamliptak.  When Alima Traore was a young girl in Mali, parts of her genitalia were cut off, which is the custom there. ''In my country, usually there is an old lady who does circumcision,'' said Ms. Traore, who is 28, lives in Maryland and works as a cashier. ''They have a small knife that they cut the intimate parts with. It is very atrocious.'' In September, the Board of Immigration Appeals rejected Ms. Traore's plea for asylum and ordered her sent back to Mali. It ruled that she did not face persecution there, because the cutting, while ''reprehensible,'' could not be repeated. ''The loss of a limb also gives rise to enduring harm,'' the board said, but it would not be a good enough reason to grant asylum. The board also said that Ms. Traore's fear that any daughters she might have would be subjected to similar barbarity was of no moment. Nor did it matter that Ms. Traore's father has said he will force her to marry a first cousin -- his sister's son. ''My decision is irrevocable,'' her father, Elhadj Traore, wrote to her in 2004. ''The dowry has been paid, and all the Traore clan agrees. The animal sacrifice has been made for the village.'' Lauri Steven Filppu, writing for a three-member panel of the immigration board, was measured in his sympathy. ''It is understandable,'' he wrote, that Ms. Traore, ''an educated young woman, would prefer to choose her own spouse rather than acquiesce to pressure from her family to marry someone she does not love and with whom she expects to be unhappy. The respondent has also expressed valid concerns about possible birth defects resulting from a union with her first cousin.'' ''While we do not discount the respondent's concerns,'' Mr. Filppu continued, ''we do not see how the reluctant acceptance of family tradition over personal preference can form the basis'' for allowing Ms. Traore to stay in the United States. Karen Musalo, the director of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at Hastings College of the Law, said that reasoning was the product of a judicial system dominated by men. ''Are women's rights human rights?'' Professor Musalo asked. ''Isn't it a human right not to be forced into a marriage?'' Last week, Ms. Traore's lawyers filed a motion for reconsideration. They noted that the logic of the board's decision was not always easy to follow. The board acknowledged, for instance, that women who have been subjected to forced sterilization are routinely granted asylum even though that procedure, like genital cutting, cannot be repeated. The board, which is part of the Justice Department, rejected the reasoning of a 2005 decision by the federal appeals court in California, which refused to deport a woman who had been subjected to genital cutting in Somalia. ''Like forced sterilization,'' Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ''genital mutilation permanently disfigures a woman, causes long-term health problems, and deprives her of a normal and fulfilling sexual life.'' That is an understatement, Professor Musalo said. ''The kind of physical and psychological devastation that goes along with female genital cutting is profound,'' Professor Musalo said. ''It results in sex that is absolutely torturous, that not only has no pleasure but is a locus point of pain and agony.'' Ms. Traore used simpler language. ''I don't feel great in my body,'' she said. ''A woman needs to be complete.'' Professor Musalo had a theory about why the board treated forced sterilization differently from genital cutting. Sterilization affects procreation and motherhood, which are valued by men. Genital cutting, by contrast, affects only women's sexual pleasure and autonomy. The board, for its part, said the differing treatment of forced sterilization and genital cutting was required by a federal law. But the law said nothing about whether courts must grant asylum to past victims of either kind of abuse, a fact Mr. Filppu of the immigration board recognized in a 2003 dissent. In the September decision and in earlier cases, the immigration board referred to the procedure as F.G.M., for female genital mutilation. The abbreviation bothered Judge Reinhardt. ''We see no need for using initials rather than the full three-word phrase,'' he wrote in the 2005 decision. ''We are short neither of paper nor of ink. The use of initials, if it has any effect, serves only to dull the senses and minimize the barbaric nature of the practice.'' Some 95 percent of women in Mali have undergone genital cutting, according to State Department reports. The procedure takes various forms, ranging from the removal of the clitoral hood to the excision of all of the external genitalia. Ms. Traore's clitoris and vulva were removed. The cutting is performed, a 2001 State Department report said, with ''a special saw-toothed knife,'' usually unsterilized and almost always without anesthesia. Some tribes in Mali believe, the report said, ''that if the clitoris comes in contact with the baby's head during birth, the child will die'' or that ''a man could be killed by the secretion of a poison from the clitoris upon its contact with the penis.'' Ms. Traore has lived here since 2000. She arrived on a tourist visa and stayed on a student visa, attending college and studying nursing. But her student visa expired in 2003. She would like to stay. ''It is a better place for women than Mali, because in Mali women don't have any voice,'' she said. ''Because it is the men who control.''",2007,"Mali"
"33","Court Rules Niger Failed By Allowing Girl's Slavery","Africa","A West African regional court ruled Monday that  the government of Niger had failed  to protect a young woman  sold into slavery at the age of 12. The landmark ruling, the first of its kind by a regional tribunal now sitting in Niamey, Niger's capital, ordered the government to pay about $19,000 in damages to the woman, Hadijatou Mani, who is now 24. Slavery is outlawed throughout Africa, but it persists in pockets of Niger, Mali, Mauritania and amid conflicts like the one in northern Uganda. Antislavery organizations estimate that 43,000 people are enslaved in Niger alone, where nomadic tribes like the Tuareg and Toubou have for centuries held members of other ethnic groups as slaves. Ms. Mani's experience was typical of the practice. She was born into a traditional slave class and sold to Souleymane Naroua when she was 12 for about $500. Ms. Mani told court officials that Mr. Naroua had forced her to work his fields for a decade. She also claimed that he raped her repeatedly over the years. ''I was beaten so many times I would run back to my family,'' she told the BBC. ''Then after a day or two I would be brought back.'' Ms. Mani brought her case to the court this year, arguing that the Niger government had failed to enforce its antislavery laws. She had initially sought protection under Niger's laws. In 2005, Mr. Naroua gave her a certificate freeing  her, but when she tried to get married he claimed that she was already married to him. A local court ruled for Ms. Mani, but a higher court reversed the judgment. In an absurd twist, Ms. Mani, who had gone ahead and married the other man, was sentenced to six months in jail for bigamy. She was released after serving two months. ''Nobody deserves to be enslaved,'' Ms. Mani said in a statement. ''We are all equal and deserve to be treated the same. I hope that everybody in slavery today can find their freedom. No woman should suffer the way I did.'' Slavery has long been tolerated in Niger. The Niamey government outlawed the practice in 2003, but it continues in the remote reaches of the vast, arid and impoverished nation that straddles the Sahara. Antislavery organizations hailed the decision as an important victory against deeply entrenched social customs. ''For 17 years, we have been working towards bringing slavery to the attention of the authorities,'' said Ilguilas Weila, president of Timidria, a Niger antislavery advocacy group, in a statement. ''This verdict means that the state of Niger will now have to resolve this problem once and for all.'' The Community Court of Justice, the entity that ruled against Niger, is a judicial arm of Ecowas, a political and trade group of West African nations. The court, which can sit in any of the member nations, was created in 2000 and has made a number of important rulings. But its limited ability to enforce them has sapped its influence. Earlier this year, the court ordered the government of Gambia to release a journalist who had been missing for two years and was believed to be in government custody.

No matter who wins, the people face a tragic future. Atrocities abound. Last month, a 13-year-old girl was stoned to death in an area controlled by Islamist rebels after being gang-raped and then, outrageously, accused of adultery. Stoning is torture, no less so when religious sanction is claimed. As the new regime advances, women in particular will suffer, as they did in Afghanistan under the Taliban.

"35","Justice for the Poorest","Africa","-- For the poor in a place such as Zambia -- and perhaps for the poor in every place -- there is an eggshell fragility to life. A single crack and all is broken. For Zilose, a gentle woman in her early 40s, it began with the death of her husband, probably from AIDS. Then she became sick, with typical AIDS symptoms -- trouble with her legs, a persistent cough. After spending some time in her home village, she returned to Lusaka to find that her in-laws had taken all her property and had ordered her out of her home. This is a common practice called ""property grabbing,"" in which relatives of a dead husband steal everything from the widow and her children. Zilose refused to leave her home, but she was forced to send her 10-year-old child away because she could no longer afford to care for him. Zilose urgently needed a lawyer, and she found one through a remarkable organization called International Justice Mission. The staff at IJM pressed the court case for the recovery of her property and helped her get AIDS treatment and job training. Sitting in her two-room cinderblock home, with neat embroidery and lace covering battered furniture, Zilose reports that her health is now good and asks eagerly about the progress of her case, which should be decided by the end of the year. When experts in development talk about the ""rule of law,"" they often mean protections for business contracts and commerce. But Zilose's case is also a failure of the rule of law -- one far more common and destructive, especially for women and girls. Across the developing world, poor women receive little justice when it comes to property issues, sexual slavery, domestic abuse or sexual violence. Hard figures are difficult to come by, but a World Bank report has estimated that in some parts of the developing world, more than two-thirds of women are beaten or coerced into sex during their lifetimes. And almost all of these crimes take place with impunity. Police are often indifferent, hostile or corrupt; judges and prosecutors view rape and abuse as lesser offenses; lawyers who take such cases are either unaffordable or unavailable. The lawyers working at IJM in Zambia point to the defilement of young women as a particularly disturbing case study. There is a persistent myth in Africa that sexual relations with a virgin will cure AIDS. So IJM has seen a 2-year-old rape victim with permanent physical injuries and a mentally disabled 6-year-old rape victim. The physical evidence of these crimes is clear. But children are often not allowed to give sworn testimony in court. And there is no DNA testing to provide evidence. So, according to one IJM employee, getting a conviction often comes down to: ""Can anyone hear you scream?"" Zambian law has strict penalties for defilement and rape. And the Zambian government has created a victims support unit to deal with such crimes. But the cultural obstacles to enforcement are massive. Says one IJM employee: ""When women bring a charge against their husband, the police often tell her, 'This is a domestic matter.' Even her own family will sometimes tell her, 'Go back to your husband.' "" These problems call for a range of responses, including girls' education and the economic empowerment of women. It is difficult to know and claim your rights if you cannot read, and difficult to leave an abusive environment if you cannot earn a living on your own. IJM has opened another promising front in the cause of development and human rights. In addition to providing the poor with lawyers, it co-prosecutes rape and defilement cases with the police in Zambia. And it gives community workshops on property rights. The one I attended was alternately conducted in two Zambian languages I did not understand, but I occasionally caught the English phrases ""fixed assets,"" ""title deeds"" and ""executors."" The founder of IJM, Gary Haugen, argues that the legal empowerment of the poor is an essential precondition for development. He believes the United States could make a dramatic difference in the developing world by helping to strengthen and professionalize responsible police and prosecutors -- training them to use rape kits and other tools of the trade -- and by supporting the provision of legal aid to the poor. And Haugen believes that even the small victories of simply enforcing existing laws can encourage broader social change, as the possibility of justice gradually becomes an expectation of justice. For millions of women such as Zilose, nothing is more important. michaelgerson@cfr.org",2008,"Zambia"
"36","In Zambia, Pictures of Birth, Mailed as Protest, Bring Arrest","Africa","The photographs were shocking. People flinched when they saw them. The editors of The Post, an independent daily in Zambia, decided such gruesome pictures were simply not publishable. And yet the images also seemed extremely important. The nation's health workers were on strike, and the woman in the photo was giving birth outside of a hospital where she had been unable to get medical attention. The baby was shown emerging feet first  from the naked mother. Soon the child was dead. On June 10, Chansa Kabwela, the paper's news editor, sent the distressing photos to Zambia's vice president, George Kunda, asking him ''to take quick action and end this strike.'' Copies were delivered to the health minister, the secretary to the cabinet, the archbishop of Lusaka, the capital, and two women's groups. On Monday, the police arrested Ms. Kabwela, charging her under Section 177 [1A] of the penal code: distributing obscene materials in order to corrupt the morals of society. She was fingerprinted, taken to a jail cell and then finally released on a surety bond of about $1,000. She faces five years in prison. ''The government deliberately decided to misunderstand my intention,'' Ms. Kabwela, 29, said in a phone interview. ''I wanted them to see the suffering of the mother. Instead they called it pornography.'' Of some possible relevance to Monday's arrest is the fact that The Post and the government of President Rupiah Banda are hardly the best of friends. Zambia is a poor, landlocked country of nearly 12 million people in southern Africa, and the newspaper has regularly accused the government of corruption. Mr. Banda was not sent the photographs, but they nevertheless came to his attention. At a news conference on June 24, he called them pornography and said, ''I hope those responsible for the law of this country will pursue this matter.'' The more he spoke, the closer he came to rage: ''Shame on you, photographer, who took pictures of our mothers naked. I couldn't look at it. When I looked at it, I threw it away.'' The president's anger was mirrored by the two prominent women's groups that had also been on Ms. Kabwela's mailing list. ''We have been extremely shocked and disgusted at the pictures you have circulated of a woman in childbirth,'' read a letter from Marian Munyinda, the chairwoman of the Non-Governmental Organizations Coordinating Council. ''Not only is it a gross violation of the woman's privacy and dignity but more so of the sanctity of human life.'' In a written response, Ms. Kabwela explained that the photos were taken by the woman's husband. He tearfully brought them to the newspaper in hope that their publication might avert more tragedies, she said. Ms. Kabwela objected to the word ''circulated'' in Ms. Munyinda's letter. She answered, ''We circulate whatever we want to circulate by publishing it in The Post. Our intention in sending those pictures to a few selected people'' was to urge them ''to help the women bearing the worst brunt of this strike.'' She apologized. ''We actually know very little about women's issues,'' Ms. Kabwela wrote. ''Our intention was not to violate the rights of that woman or to offend yourselves as your letter indicates. And for that we are extremely sorry. We have learnt our lesson, and we will know how to conduct ourselves in the future over issues of this nature. Please excuse and forgive our ignorance, we are not polymaths.'' But during the past few days, with Ms. Kabwela's arrest impending, The Post seems to have forgone its remorse. Editorials refer to the women's groups as ''treacherous and opportunistic.'' As usual, those same broadsides refer to Mr. Banda as corrupt, though this time the accusation of corruption relates to ''the abuse of power, arrogance and the lack of humility.'' Neither Vice President Kunda nor others contacted in the government would publicly comment on the case, saying it was now in the courts. As for the strike, it ended on June 29 after the government threatened to replace the health workers.",2009,"Zambia"
"37","Zambia Judge Clears Editor In Morals Case Over Photos","Africa","A Zambian newspaper editor was acquitted Monday on charges of distributing obscene materials with the intent of corrupting public morals, a case filed against her after she sent photos of a woman in childbirth to government officials and other prominent figures. Many media advocates in Zambia and throughout the world considered the arrest of Chansa Kabwela, news editor of The Post, to be an assault on press freedom. The newspaper and the government of President Rupiah Banda have been at loggerheads about allegations of public corruption. ''This was a case started by President Banda against us,'' Fred M'membe, the paper's editor in chief, said in comments on The Post's Web site after the ruling. ''He publicly accused us of pornography and called us all sorts of names. He insulted us of being sick, morbid and peculiar.'' In June, during a strike by health workers, a pregnant woman was refused care at a hospital in Lusaka, the capital. The woman gave birth outside the hospital building. Her baby died. According to Ms. Kabwela, photos were taken during those hectic moments by the woman's husband. He tearfully took them to The Post in the hope that their publication might avert similar tragedies, she said. But while the editor judged the pictures to be too graphic for publication, she considered them important. She wanted to send them ''to people who had the capacity to end the strike,'' she said in an interview after her arrest. Her mailing list included George Kunda, the country's vice president; the health minister; the secretary to the cabinet; the archbishop of Lusaka; and two women's groups. She was arrested a month later. President Banda had not been sent the photos, but he did learn of them and lashed out against them at  a news conference, saying, ''I hope those responsible for the law of this country will pursue this matter.'' Members of the women's groups said the photos belittled the sacred act of birth and  invaded the mother's privacy. In Monday's ruling, Magistrate Charles Kafunda described the pictures. They showed the child, reportedly dead, emerging feet first from the distraught mother. The magistrate said he sympathized with witnesses who found the photos to be shocking. Nevertheless, he said, the prosecution had failed to prove that Ms. Kabwela had used the photos to taint the morals of society. ''I have been vindicated,'' Ms. Kabwela said, according to The Post's Web site. ''I have always said that whatever I did was purely out of good will on behalf of The Post.''",2009,"Zambia"
"38","600 Raped On Border Of Congo, U.N. Says","Africa","NAIROBI, Kenya -- More than 600 women and girls were recently raped along the Congo-Angola border during a mass expulsion of illegal immigrants, according to the United Nations. Many of the victims said they were locked in dungeon-like conditions for several weeks while they were raped repeatedly by security forces. At least one woman died from her internal injuries, United Nations officials said. Maurizio Giuliano, a United Nations spokesman in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said Friday that it was unclear on which side of the Congo-Angola border the women had been attacked, and that the United Nations was calling on both countries to investigate promptly. ''What worries us is that rape seems to be becoming endemic in several parts of Congo,'' Mr. Giuliano said, also referring to recent rapes in the eastern Kivu provinces. ''We fear it's becoming part of the routine.'' For the past decade, Congo has been torn apart by dozens of rebel groups that have often swept into villages and brutalized women. United Nations officials call Congo the worst place in the world for sexual violence, and even the longstanding presence of international peacekeepershas not been able to stop it. A few months ago, more than 200 women were raped in a single thatched-roof village in eastern Congo while United Nations peacekeepers were less than 12 miles away. According to United Nations officials, the women along the border were raped in September and October at several locations during an expulsion of more than 6,000 illegal Congolese and other immigrants from Angola. The two countries often expel each other's citizens. Last year, Angola expelled 160,000 Congolese, while Congo expelled 51,000 Angolans, according to United Nations officials. Angola is fast becoming an economic powerhouse, with a booming oil business and diamond exports, after decades of intense civil war. The United Nations first learned about the rapes along the border last month, after hearing scattered reports from local aid organizations. But the initial reports suggested that around 30 Congolese women had been raped, not 600. Many of the women said they had been kept in derelict buildings and gang-raped by security forces. When they were released, they said they had been forced to walk back into Congo without any clothes.",2010,"Kenya"
"39","In This Rape Center, the Patient Was 3","Africa","FREETOWN, Sierra Leone IN a rape treatment center here, I met a 3-year-old patient named Jessica, who was cuddling a teddy bear. Jessica had seemed sick and was losing weight, but she wouldn't say what was wrong. Her mother took her to a clinic, and a doctor ferreted out the truth. She had been raped and was infected with gonorrhea. As I stood in the rape center corridor, reeling from the encounter with Jessica, a 4-year-old girl was brought in for treatment. She, too, turned out to have been infected with a sexually transmitted disease in the course of a rape. Also in the center that day were a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old, along with older girls. Sexual violence is a public health crisis in much of the world, and women and girls ages 15 to 44 are more likely to be maimed or killed by men than by malaria, cancer, war or traffic accidents combined, according to a 2005 study. Such violence remains a significant problem in the United States, but it's particularly prevalent in countries like Sierra Leone, Liberia or Congo that have endured civil war. The pattern is that after peace arrives, men stop shooting each other but continue to rape women and girls at staggering rates -- and often at staggeringly young ages. The International Rescue Committee, which runs the rape center here in Freetown, the nation's capital, says that 26 percent of the rape victims it treats are 11 years old or younger. Last month, the center said, a 10-month-old baby was brought in for treatment after a rape. ''The girls are being blamed,'' noted Amie Kandeh, a heroic American-educated Sierra Leonean who runs women's programs here for the International Rescue Committee (www.rescue.org). ''If a girl is raped and she's above 5, then it's the way she was dressed. But we've had a girl of 2-and-a-half months who was raped. Was it the way her mom put her diaper on?'' That 2-and-a-half-month-old baby died of internal injuries sustained during the rape, said Ms. Kandeh. The struggle against sexual violence will be won or lost primarily within each country, but the United States could help if Congress reintroduced and passed the International Violence Against Women Act, which would take modest steps to raise the profile of such violence. And the United States could hurt the effort if House Republicans succeed in eliminating financing for the United Nations Population Fund, which works in places like Sierra Leone to combat rape. Ultimately, the only way to end the epidemic of sexual violence is to end the silence and impunity and send people to prison. But that almost never happens. Ms. Kandeh says that the International Rescue Committee rape centers have treated more than 9,000 patients since 2003 -- and fewer than one-half of 1 percent of the rapes have resulted in criminal convictions. In the eastern city of Kenema, a day's drive from the capital, I met a 13-year-old girl, named TaJoe, who was being treated for a rape -- and whose case underscores why survivors keep quiet. TaJoe is a bright seventh grader, ranking third in her class of 18. One evening recently, she needed to use the outhouse, some distance away, and she asked her sister to escort her. The sister scoffed and said she'd be fine. TaJoe went by herself, and she says that on her way back she was grabbed by a businessman, thrown to the ground, and raped. Ashamed and afraid, TaJoe confided in no one. But she developed a sexually transmitted infection that caused a raging fever. She stopped eating, and her health deteriorated. When her family took her to a clinic, doctors discovered the problem and she ''confessed.'' The businessman was suspected of raping two other girls in the village, but he also was educated and rich. When TaJoe implicated him, the police acted quickly. They detained TaJoe and her mother, accusing them of sullying the name of a respected member of the community. The police later released them, but the episode terrified TaJoe. Meanwhile, she says, the businessman promised that if he remained free he would pay all of TaJoe's future school fees -- a bribe that gives her hope of completing an education and transforming her life. When I asked TaJoe what should be done with the case, she was adamant. ''I do not want prosecution,'' she said. ''I don't want to make trouble.'' I asked whether the businessman will continue to rape girls. TaJoe said listlessly that maybe he had learned his lesson. She knows that her well-being in the village -- and, perhaps, her hopes of a medical career -- depend upon her surrender. ''My fear is that they will go and arrest this man,'' she told me. So is the situation hopeless? To my surprise, I found a hint of progress, especially when a teenage girl asked me to help capture her rapist. I'll tell that story in my next column.",2011,"Sierra Leone"
"40","Zimbabwe: 3 Women Charged With Sexual Attacks on 17 Men","Africa","The police in Zimbabwe on Friday charged three women in connection with a spate of sexual attacks on male hitchhikers over the past two years, CNN reports. The women, who were identified as two sisters, Sophie Nhokwara, 26, and Netsai Nhokwara, 24, and a third woman, Rosemary Chakwizira, 24, were arrested last Sunday and charged with 17 counts of aggravated indecent assault -- one count for each man who identified the women as his attackers. They were arrested in Gweru, a town a few hours south of the capital city of Harare, according to the CNN report. From an article on CNN's Web site: ""Since Monday, 17 men came and positively identified the women as having raped them,"" said a police official in Harare who refused to be identified. ""Most of the men said the women would offer a drink either laced with something to tranquilize them or were forced at gunpoint."" An article in The Daily Mail said that the women were arrested after becoming involved in a car accident, information it attributed Charles Makono, a ""Midlands police chief senior assistant commissioner."" After the accident, the women asked police officers if they could retrieve a bag from the vehicle. The bag allegedly contained 33 condoms, enough to lead to their arrest on suspicion that they were involved in the string of attacks on male hitchhikers in the area. The Mail also featured a picture of Sophie Nhokwara, one of the alleged attackers, who looks youthful and composed in a blond wig. In an article from Oct. 8, 2010, the New Zimbabwe.com News, quotes Augustine Chihuri, the commissioner general of the Zimbabwe police addressing the attacks. ""We now have a few men going to the police stations reporting such cases. Women seem to be fast overtaking men,"" the Police Commissioner General said, speaking two days after an eighth man reported being raped by women who had offered him a lift. ""I don't know why, and maybe as time goes on we will know why."" He went on to describe attacks by women as ""abominable and weird"", the article says. It is speculated, reports say, that the attacks were for ritualistic purposes. The police are calling for any other victims to step forward.

"41","Rape, a Scar from Apartheid","Africa","JOHANNESBURG - This week a cellphone video depicting a 17-year-old girl being gang-raped by seven men between the ages of 14 and 20 went viral in South Africa. The rapists were encouraging one another and offered the girl 25 cents to not report them. The men have since been arrested and the girl has been found, but there has been much public outrage: local talk shows flooded with calls, tweets under the hashtag #rapevideo, even international coverage.The incident elicited an outcry because rape, and more generally sexual violence against women and children, is all too familiar to South Africans. It's a live scar from apartheid. Doctors Without Borders claims that a woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa, a figure matched only by countries at war. The World Health Organization has reported that the first sexual experience of 40 percent of South African women is forced. The South African police say there were 63,603 ""contact crime sexual offences"" in 2010-2011 (pdf) - meaning that almost 16 percent of all South Africans were sexually violated during that year alone. And according to South Africa's Medical Research Council, one woman is murdered by an intimate partner every six hours (pdf). One contributing factor is history. South Africans lived under a brutal police state for decades. Under apartheid, there was state-directed violence against civilians, violence among civilians and violence by civilians directed back at the state. One of the many shortcomings of this society since then has been its failure to think through the psychosocial consequences of that past. The sheer relief, even ecstasy, that accompanied democracy's arrival in the mid-1990s gave way to an unspoken belief that all was now relatively well. Yet both the victims and the perpetrators of violence, state-sanctioned or personal, rarely escape their earlier experiences entirely without professional intervention. South Africa is showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress on a grand scale. The gender activist Bernedette Muthien argues that the country's past has created violent conceptions of masculinity, such as a preference for violent pornography. Here is some sad proof: soon after the gang-rape footage went viral, there were widespread pleas on Twitter and other social media from men desperately seeking to obtain copies of the video, even though it counts as pornography and is illegal. South Africa's violent past interacts toxically with a second contributing factor, deep inequality. It is that, rather than poverty, that correlates with violent crime here. Unofficial unemployment hovers around the 40 percent mark, with young people the worst affected. Archaic patriarchal notions are prevalent - men ought to be bread-winners, strong and independent - leaving many men not only to struggle through their poverty but also to feel grossly inadequate. How can the patterns of violence in South Africa be reversed? Reducing poverty and inequality would certainly help. But the scourge of sexual violence is not fundamentally an economic problem. It's about unhealthy conceptions of virility that put irrational pressure on young boys and men. Changing those will require a fuller public conversation about the scars left by our violent collective past. Understanding why such violence is happening is not to excuse the perpetrators. The aim is only to eliminate the causes of these crimes. Our past may damage us, but it does not let us off the moral hook.",2012,"South Africa"
"42","In Kenya, a Victory for Girls and Rights","Africa","There was something deliciously serendipitous about the power going off in northern Kenya on May 27 just as Judge J.A. Makau read his much-anticipated decision in a case could alter the status of women and girls in Kenya and maybe all of Africa. But the lights did come on. And the judge in the high court in Meru declared: ''By failing to enforce existing defilement laws, the police have contributed to the development of a culture of tolerance for pervasive sexual violence against girl children and impunity.'' Guilty. An extraordinary story of tenacity and courage, wit and survival led to this victory. Three years earlier, 160 girls between the ages of 3 and 17 sued the Kenyan government for failing to protect them from being raped. Now they'd made legal history: Through a constitutional challenge -- holding the state accountable for the police treatment of defilement claims -- the girls secured access to justice for themselves, and legal protection from rape for all 10 million girls in Kenya. A child is raped every 30 minutes in Kenya. One of the reasons is the demented thinking of thousands of men in sub-Saharan Africa who believe that having sex with a little girl will cure you of H.I.V. and AIDS. In fact, the belief is that the younger the girl is, the stronger the cure will be. Although there are adequate laws in the Kenyan criminal code to protect girls from what Kenyans call defilement, there is almost total impunity for the perpetrators. The laws are not enforced and the practice of defilement has been on the rise. Ninety percent of the victims have been raped by people they know -- fathers, uncles, brothers, neighbors, teachers, priests -- the very people assigned the task of keeping children safe. If the girl doesn't die of her injuries, she faces being abandoned. No one wants to have anything to do with a defiled girl. She loses her chance to go to school. She's likely sick with a sexually transmitted disease or H.I.V. She may be pregnant. Her childhood is over. She becomes poor, unhealthy and destitute. It took the courage and tenacity of 160 girls to take on a system that failed them. On Oct. 11, when the case went to court in Meru, their lawyers marched through the streets from the shelter where the girls had been staying to the courthouse. The girls wanted to march as well but were told that their identity needed to be protected and that they must stay at the shelter. Nothing doing, they said. They marched beside their advocates chanting, ''Haki yangu'' -- the Kiswahili words for ''I demand my rights.'' The guards at the courthouse slammed the gates shut as the girls approached. But they climbed the fence still chanting ''Haki yangu'' and then started to laugh at the reversal in roles being played out in front of them. ''Look,'' they called to each other. ''These men who hurt us and made us ashamed are scared of us now!'' Soon the gates were opened and the girls and their lawyers entered the court. The case actually began when lawyers from Kenya, Malawi, Ghana and Canada got together at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto and their discussion turned to the alarming rise in rape in Kenya. Canadian women had sued their government for failing to protect them and had won. The African women asked them how they achieved their victory, and when the Canadians explained the force of a constitutional challenge, they decided to go forward together. The action was the brainchild of Fiona Sampson, a Canadian who runs an organization called the Equality Effect that uses international human rights law to improve the lives of girls and women. She teamed up with Mercy Chidi, director of a shelter in Meru called Ripples International. Together they knew it was time to tackle the problem: the impunity of rapists and the failure of the justice system to convict them. The journey these children have taken is about girls daring to break taboos and speak out about sexual assault. It's about women lawyers from two sides of the world supporting youngsters in their quest for justice. It's about kids who were told they had no rights but insisted that they do. And it's the pushback reaction that women and girls everywhere have been waiting for. Within 48 hours of the court decision, Fiona Sampson had heard from people in half a dozen countries who want to undertake the same action. It's as though the centuries-old jig is up.

"43","Dropped Charges in Deadly Rape Provoke Fury in South Africa, and Pessimism","Africa","BREDASDORP, South Africa -- As Anene Booysen lay dying, she whispered to her medics the name of the man who had assaulted her and left her lying in the dirt on a construction site, her bowels spilling from her abdomen. ''Zwai,'' Ms. Booysen, 17, told at least two people before she died. Zwai -- the nickname of a close friend, Jonathan Davids -- and his friends had done this to her, she said. The next day, the police arrested Mr. Davids, 22, and another man, charging them with rape and murder. The attack, in February, produced such revulsion and outrage that it quickly became a national symbol of the epidemic of violence against women in South Africa, much as other recent cases have forced national soul-searching on sexual violence plaguing India, Egypt and Brazil. With the swift arrest of two suspects, hopes were high that the attack on Ms. Booysen would be prosecuted quickly. But just as the trial was about to start last week, the prosecutors made a dramatic announcement. Despite Ms. Booysen's dying declaration, they did not have enough evidence to prosecute Mr. Davids, and he was set free. ''We understand the sense of shock and outrage that was induced by the incident,'' Eric Ntabazalila, a spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, told reporters. ''However, as the prosecution we can only prosecute successfully on sufficient evidence.'' The trial of the second suspect began Monday, but the failure of prosecutors to make a case against Mr. Davids has shaken the public's faith in South Africa's ability to address its rape problem and hold perpetrators accountable. ''Everybody is terribly disappointed and feels incredibly let down,'' said Rachel Jewkes, an expert on violence against women at the South African Medical Research Council. ''The question is, did the police really go all out to investigate?'' About 64,000 cases of sexual assault are reported here each year, and South Africa has one of the highest rates of nonpartner rapes in the world. But studies show that number vastly understates the epidemic, suggesting that hundreds of thousands of cases are not reported. Of those that are, fewer than 10 percent result in convictions, a product, analysts say, of shoddy police work and ineffective prosecution by a criminal justice system that has largely failed to take crime against women seriously. The dismal conviction rate leaves victims feeling helpless, Ms. Jewkes said. ''Many women wonder why they should bother to report,'' she said. Like many others in Bredasdorp, a dusty, remote farming town about 100 miles southeast of Cape Town, Ms. Booysen had a difficult childhood. Her mother died when she was young, and she was passed between relatives and bounced in and out of foster homes, relatives and neighbors said. She dropped out of high school, and like many young people here, where jobs are hard to come by but alcohol and drugs are omnipresent, she spent her days idly drinking cheap beer and wine with friends. The day she was attacked was no different. On the afternoon of Feb. 1, Ms. Booysen was at a neighborhood bar, witnesses said. So was Mr. Davids, though the two had not arrived together, and were not seen drinking together, the witnesses said. Another young man, Johannes Kana, was also there. Early the next morning, Ms. Booysen was found at a construction site near her house, bleeding and near death. She was taken to the hospital but died that day. What happened after she left the bar is disputed. In an interview, Mr. Davids said that he saw Ms. Booysen at the bar, but did not drink with her, did not know the people she was with and did not see when she left. He said he left the bar to continue drinking at a friend's house. Mr. Kana admitted raping Ms. Booysen, according to the government, but denies killing her. He has been charged with rape and murder and is now the only suspect on trial. The National Prosecuting Authority did not respond to multiple requests for comment in the case. Ms. Booysen's rape and murder brought a furious response. The singer Annie Lennox led a protest march in Cape Town. A radio station played a chime every four minutes as a reminder to listeners of how often a woman is raped in South Africa. Politicians gave speeches expressing shock and promising tough new actions to protect women and girls from predators. ''The whole nation is outraged at this extreme violation and destruction of a young human life,'' President Jacob Zuma said in a statement. ''This act is shocking, cruel and most inhumane. It has no place in our country. We must never allow ourselves to get used to these acts of base criminality to our women and children.'' Despite the protestations of politicians, such crimes are neither new nor uncommon. A 2009 study by the Medical Research Council found that one-quarter of men admitted to raping someone, and nearly half of those men said they had raped more than once. One research study on a small town in Mpumalanga Province examined about 250 reported rapes from 2005 to 2007. More than half of the victims were minors. Arrests were made in 60 percent of the cases, but more than two-thirds of those cases were dropped and never came to trial. Ultimately only nine of the accused were convicted, and only seven received jail sentences. Several men were suspects in five or six different rape cases. None of those cases ever made it to court, the study found. Analysts point to the history and culture of South Africa, a deeply patriarchal society that devalues crimes against women and where 19 years after the end of apartheid the criminal justice system is still struggling to transform itself from a security force aimed mainly at protecting the white minority into a professional crime-fighting organization. The police do not take rape allegations seriously and fail to perform basic detective work, like collecting forensic evidence, said Lisa Vetten, a researcher who worked on the Mpumalanga study. Victims are intimidated by perpetrators, who are quickly released on bail. Prosecutors shy away from taking tough cases, especially those where physical evidence is not available. In some cases, appellate court judges set aside guilty verdicts because they simply do not believe the victim. Two young men in Limpopo Province were convicted of raping a 17-year-old girl in the bushes near her home in 2007. The girl had been walking to a public telephone when the two men waylaid her, forced her into the bushes and took turns assaulting her, according to the appeals court record. But in 2012, an appellate court judge set aside the conviction because her account of the assault ''has some defects which cannot be ignored.'' The victim had failed to run away or scream to passers-by, the judge said. She made up the story about being raped, the judge reasoned, to explain the bleeding from the loss of her virginity. ''It is fascinating that a judge would believe that a girl would wish to have her first sexual experience with two men she never met in a bush,'' Ms. Vetten said. ''The judge simply decided, without any real evidence to support it, that she made it up.'' As to Ms. Booysen's dying testimony pointing to Mr. Davids, the prosecution has offered no further public explanation as to why the case against him was dropped. Mr. Davids, glassy-eyed and reeking of alcohol in the middle of a recent afternoon, was smoking marijuana and fuming about the case. He seemed to regret what happened to Ms. Booysen, who he said was ''like a sister'' to him, and insisted he had nothing to do with the crime. What was bothering him was that he spent four months in jail as a suspect, which he found devastating. ''I have nothing left inside me to feel,'' he said. ''My pain is so deep I can't go any further.''",2013,"South Africa"
"44","In Zanzibar, Two Smiling Men Douse Young British Women With Acid","Africa","LONDON -- The two young volunteers from London had been briefed on how to dress respectfully. They had been warned not to wear anything provocative while teaching on the island of Zanzibar during the month of Ramadan. So when the volunteers, Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee, both 18, strolled into Stone Town to get dinner last Wednesday, those who know them said they covered up despite the heat. The two men who rode up behind them on a moped gave no reason for targeting them -- the men stopped, smiled and then doused the young women in acid, severely burning their faces, chests and hands, before speeding away. Ms. Trup has been temporarily discharged from the West London hospital that has been treating the teenagers since their return to Britain on Friday, but she will return for a skin graft on Thursday, her mother, Rochelle, said. Ms. Gee remained in the burn unit of the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. ''Thank you for all your support,'' she wrote on Twitter, in the first public comment from the women. No suspects had been arrested by Tuesday afternoon, and the motive for the attack remained a mystery, Musa Ali Musa, Zanzibar's regional police commissioner, said in a telephone interview. But the ordeal raised questions about religious tension that has bubbled up in unexpected pockets of East Africa, and about whether acid attacks -- a particularly nasty type of assault that can leave victims disfigured for life -- may be spreading to places where there is no history of them. According to one account, a friend said Ms. Trup had been singled out on the island once before. A local woman went up to her angrily and struck her in the face, telling her not to sing in public during the Muslim fast, the friend, Oli Cohen, told The Daily Telegraph. ''They were both extremely shaken up by it,'' Mr. Cohen was quoted as saying. The acid attack appears to be the first such assault on a Western tourist or aid worker, said Jaf Shah, the executive director of Acid Survivors Trust International. It was certainly the first such attack on foreigners in Zanzibar, a popular tourist destination about 20 miles off the coast of mainland Tanzania. With about 200,000 tourists flocking to the island every year, residents are used to seeing Westerners on their beaches. But in remote parts of the island, signs ask visitors to dress modestly. On the day of the attack, Ms. Trup and Ms. Gee wore long pants and T-shirts, so their shoulders were covered, said Maria Hannis, who spoke to them shortly before they set off to town that day. Ms. Hannis, a team leader at the charity Art in Tanzania, which organized the teenagers' placement as teachers at the St. Monica Catholic nursery school, said they had been ''sensible and sensitive.'' Ms. Trup's father, Marc, said the two young women had also been careful not to wear anything that might have revealed that they were Jewish. ''We know it's a Muslim country,'' he told The Times of London. ''They were Western girls. Unfortunately, they went out during the month of Ramadan.'' Conservative Muslims and Western visitors have long coexisted peacefully on Zanzibar. But in recent months, there have been several violent episodes with religious overtones, mostly targeting Christians. In February, a Roman Catholic priest was shot to death, and a church was burned. Last year, another priest was shot and wounded, and several churches were burned, Mr. Musa said. ''It's a very sensitive issue,'' he said. In an episode last November, a moderate Muslim cleric was hurt in an acid attack. The cleric, Sheik Fadhil Soraga, has blamed an Islamic group for the attacks on himself and on the two British teenagers. The group, which calls itself Uamsho, Swahili for ''Awakening,'' wants to force strict dress codes on foreign visitors and ban alcohol outside private hotels. So far, there is no evidence linking Uamsho to the attack on the teenagers. One friend of the young women in Zanzibar, Olivia Moore, told the broadcaster Channel 4 that the attackers had stopped and smiled at them before throwing the acid. According to widely reported comments by their families, friends and people on the scene, the teenagers then ran into a cafe on the seafront, screaming for water. Staff members grabbed bottles from a refrigerator and poured water over Ms. Gee, while Ms. Trup ran into the sea, a decision that may have helped to leave her less badly burned, her father said. With the help of the British consul, the teenagers were eventually taken to a hotel and washed more thoroughly under a shower there. Before returning to London on Friday, they spent a day in a hospital in Tanzania's largest city, Dar es Salaam, where the president of Tanzania, Jakaya Kikwete, visited them, vowing that those responsible would be found. The minister of tourism, Said Ali Mbarouk, told The Guardian that the episode had ''shocked and shamed'' his country. Security was increased in tourist areas, and measures were taken to curb the distribution and production of acid. A reward of more than $6,000 has been offered for information that leads to an arrest. ''All our security forces are working very hard in making sure that the culprits are caught,'' Mr. Mbarouk said. Acid attacks are not uncommon in some East African countries -- Uganda, for example, reported 29 in 2010 -- but they have been rare in Tanzania, said Mr. Shah of Acid Survivors Trust International. Historically, such attacks are not specific to Muslim countries, he said. Acid became widely available in the 18th century in Europe and the United States, and more recently, its use in attacks has been most widespread in South Asia. Of the 1,500 attacks recorded by the police, by governments and in the news media every year, two-thirds take place in India, Mr. Shah said. Pakistan accounts for a considerable number, and while no official figures are available for Afghanistan, aid workers and journalists periodically report attacks there. In some cases, men have been attacked with acid, including the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, who was assaulted in January. But more than three in four acid attacks are against women, Mr. Shah said, and the practice is most widespread in societies where women have limited rights. Common motives include the rejection of marriage proposals or sexual advances.",2013,"Tanzania"
"45","How Brave Girls Helped Crack a Taboo","Africa","NAIROBI, Kenya -- For a window into rape culture, consider an 11-year-old girl named Flevian, who says that her grandfather has been raping her almost daily since she was in the first grade. She's brilliant, and, even as she lived with constant abuse and fear, she alternated between first and second in her class of more than 100. Flevian says she could have done better if she hadn't been terrified of her grandfather's threats to cut her throat if she told anyone about the rapes. Yet her family and community didn't seem to take the issue seriously, and the Kenyan police haven't taken sexual violence seriously. Once, when Flevian was about 8 years old, the grandfather was caught abusing her. After much discussion, the extended family decided to ''purify'' Flevian with traditional herbs -- and left it at that. Flevian's fate is common. The World Health Organization estimates that 35 percent of women worldwide have been sexually assaulted or subjected to domestic violence. In the Kibera slum here in Nairobi where Flevian lives, many residents say that for a majority of women, their first sexual experience is rape. Rapes happen partly because women and girls are devalued and blamed. In India, a poll found that 68 percent of judges believed that ''provocative attire'' amounts to ''an invitation to rape.'' Yet there is hope. Rape thrives when it is a taboo -- considered too indelicate to discuss. Now more and more women and men are speaking out, from India to Kenya to America. Here in Nairobi, there were public protests late last year after a group of young men who brutally gang-raped a 16-year-old girl were ''punished'' by being made to cut the grass at a police station. In my last column, I wrote about a grass-roots organization in Kibera, Shining Hope for Communities, that is tackling the sexual violence epidemic. Now it is handling several rapes each week, pushing to get prosecutions in each one. One of Shining Hope's social workers, who is helping victims and their families get justice from the police, is Editar Adhiambo. She is an ebullient woman of 25 who says that she was raped at age 6 and again at 15 -- and is determined to end the impunity. It was Editar and her colleagues at Shining Hope who received a tip about Flevian and rushed to help. Words can't capture the horror of that scene. Flevian is tiny and fragile, and she was in great pain after what she says was a particularly brutal rape. A social worker carried her to the police station. In a terrified whisper, she identified the rapist as her grandfather, and neighbors confirmed that they had known about the abuse for years. In this case, the system worked. The police agreed to arrest the grandfather. He insisted that he had never raped her, but the court later set bail for $4,700, an unusually high amount here. The arrest sent shock waves throughout the community because punishment for rape has been so rare. That may be changing. In my last column I introduced Ida, a 4-year-old Kenyan girl who had been raped by a neighbor. Ida's family made repeated visits to the Kilimani police station to seek justice, but the police kept ''misplacing'' documents and no arrest was made. Yet, eventually, as in Flevian's case, police arrested the young man whom Ida and a neighbor eyewitness identified as the rapist. Yes, my presence may have played a role in the police turnabout, but the more sustainable intervention is the constant prodding by local activists from Shining Hope for Communities. The young man arrested gave his age as 12, although neighbors said they thought he was a few years older. He admitted the rape. ''This has had a big impact here,'' Rosemary, the neighbor who caught the boy during the rape, said of the arrest. ''Parents are talking to their sons, telling them to be careful.'' That's a lesson for the world, including the United States. We need to erode the sense of male entitlement, build up female empowerment, end the taboos and, above all, end the impunity. One step that the United States could take would be for Congress to pass the International Violence Against Women Act. This wouldn't require new spending but has been stalled for years by a combination of lack of interest and perplexing hard-line Republican opposition. Passage wouldn't solve the pathologies of sexual violence, but it would elevate the issue and show support for those like Ida and Flevian who could use our backing. When sexual violence is endemic worldwide, does Congress really want to continue sitting on the fence?",2014,"Kenya"
"46","Congolese Militia Leader Convicted in Attack on Village","Africa","PARIS -- The International Criminal Court on Friday convicted a militia leader from the Democratic Republic of Congo in an attack on a Congolese village in 2003 in which more than 200 people were shot and hacked to death, and women were raped and abducted to serve as sex slaves. The militia leader, Germain Katanga, was found guilty by two of the three judges at the court in The Hague of complicity in organizing the attack on the village of Bogoro and providing guns to speed the killing. He was acquitted of charges of rape and the use of child soldiers. Mr. Katanga's conviction is only the second in the decade since the court's work began. The other guilty verdict, in March 2012, involved Thomas Lubanga, a militia leader who was among Mr. Katanga's enemies in the Ituri region of Congo, where years of fighting have been fueled by ethnic strife and rivalries for power and mineral riches. A third militia leader, Mathieu Ngudjolo, who had stood trial with Mr. Katanga and led an allied fighting group, was acquitted in December 2012. All three cases have been marked by uncertain witness testimony and what critics say is a lack of prosecutorial evidence. Lawyers following the proceedings say the cases have illustrated the hurdles faced by the court in passing judgment on crimes that happen in shifting bush wars, in distant, almost inaccessible regions where combatants are often mercenaries or children. In their ruling, the judges noted that militia members, wielding machetes and firing indiscriminately, had attacked the village ''while its inhabitants were still asleep.'' Mr. Katanga had initially been charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes. But toward the end of the trial, two of the judges, citing incomplete evidence, downgraded the charges against him and defined his role as an accomplice to war crimes rather than as a principal perpetrator. The dissenting judge on Friday, Christine van den Wyngaert of Belgium, said that Mr. Katanga should have been acquitted because his trial had lasted too long -- Mr. Katanga arrived in The Hague in 2007 -- and because the shift in charges had violated his rights as a defendant. His acquittal on the rape charges drew mixed reactions from women's groups who have long denounced the widespread rape and abduction of women as sex slaves for fighters in the Congolese conflict. Brigid Inder of the Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice, one of the rights groups following the trial, said the judgment was inconsistent. ''We are extremely disappointed that the judges appeared to expect a different level of proof'' for sexual crimes than for pillaging, murder or destruction of property, she said. The attack on Bogoro, although a ''modest'' case, she said, was representative of the types of attacks and the types of violence specifically directed against women. Karen Naimer of Physicians for Human Rights said that despite the mixed verdict, progress was made because the International Criminal Court had included charges of sexual violence for the first time. Ms. Naimer said it demonstrated a greater focus on such crimes, ''and reminds us just how critical it is to collect, document and preserve forensic medical evidence in order for these cases to succeed.'' Mr. Katanga will be sentenced in a separate hearing.",2014,"DRC"
"47","Boko Haram's Continuing Rampage","Africa","More than six months have passed since the Boko Haram extremist group seized the world's attention by kidnapping 276 schoolgirls in Nigeria. After a ''Bring Back Our Girls'' campaign went viral on social media, the United States, France, Britain and Israel joined an international effort to locate the girls. That effort has been fruitless. Fifty-seven of the girls have escaped, but 219 remain captive. In recent months, Boko Haram has stepped up its efforts, kidnapping young women and teenagers from the places where they should be safest: their homes and schools. On Oct. 18, the day after the Nigerian military announced that it had reached a cease-fire agreement with the group, Boko Haram went on a house-to-house search for young women in two Nigerian towns, taking 60. Last weekend, Boko Haram kidnapped 30 teenagers, including girls as young as 11 years old. A horrible fate awaits the abducted, as documented by Human Rights Watch in a report published this week. Boko Haram singles out mostly Christians, threatening them with death if they do not convert to Islam, and forcing teenagers into ''marriages'' with Boko Haram fighters. The captives are treated as slaves, and they are raped, beaten and tortured. More than 7,000 Nigerians have died since Boko Haram began its insurgency in 2009. In the first six months of this year, the group killed 2,053 civilians. Nigeria's minister of foreign affairs, Aminu Wali, claimed on Monday that negotiations between his government and Boko Haram were continuing and that a deal would be reached soon. Nigerians have heard such promises before. The government and army are part of the problem. The government has failed in its fundamental duty to protect some of the country's most vulnerable citizens and help the victims who have escaped Boko Haram recover from their trauma. The army -- corrupt, ill-equipped and understaffed -- has proved to be no match for the extremist group and has itself committed grave human-rights abuses. The Nigerian government must ensure that perpetrators of abuse on both sides are called to account. President Goodluck Jonathan is expected to announce soon that he will run for re-election in February. Securing the captives' release would obviously give Mr. Jonathan's candidacy a boost. But to break Boko Haram's murderous sway over one of Nigeria's poorest regions -- nearly 70 percent of the people in northeastern Nigeria live below the poverty line -- Mr. Jonathan must figure out ways to distribute the nation's oil wealth more fairly and provide the jobs, education and vital services many Nigerians lack. These are long-term tasks, but even signs of a genuine effort to address inequality and reform the army would help.",2014,"Nigeria"
"48","ABUSE OF RURAL WOMEN IS ON THE INCREASE IN INDIA","Asia","Until recently Maya Tyagi, a 22-year-old peasant from a tiny village near here, was not known outside her circle of friends and relatives. Today she is a reluctant national figure who, as the victim of a brutal asault, has become a symbol for the seemingly widespread sexual abuse of country women. On June 18, in a bizarre encounter with the local police, her husband, Ishwar, and two of his friends were killed. Mrs. Tyagi, who was four months' pregnant, was stripped and paraded before a large crowd, beaten up and raped at the police station, where she was said to have had a miscarriage. Since then Mrs. Tyagi has been visited by a steady stream of political leaders and reporters. As her story made headlines in the national newspapers, she has been the subject of heated debate in Parliament and noisy street demonstrations by a women's organization demanding protection against male brutality. The case of Mrs. Tyagi has been the most dramatic and politically sensitive in a series of almost daily reports of rape committed against women by the police or abductors. Death Penalty Is Urged In Parliament the other day most of the members who spoke during a debate on the increase in rape suggested that the death penalty be mandated for convicted offenders. Opposition leaders condemned the Government for inaction and cited the Baghpat incident as an example of what they called the shielding of policemen. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had earlier called Mrs. Tyagi to New Delhi and after listening to her story ordered an inquiry into the incident. She refused to take action against the policemen involved, however. According to the Baghpat police the three men who were killed were members of a gang of robbers, known here as dacoits, who were wanted in several cases. D.P. Gaur, the local police chief, said they were apprehended as they were driving near the police station. He said the three had guns and fired at the policemen, who fired back in self defense. According to Mr. Gaur, the robbers included Mrs. Tyagi's husband. Mrs. Tyagi, the police chief said, was also in the car and was seized by a crowd that had gathered. He said it was the crowd that stripped Mrs. Tyagi and molested her and that the police had rescued her. He said Mrs. Tyagi was not raped. Interviewed at the home of her parents in the village of Sankhaputhi, five miles east of here, Mrs. Tyagi denied that her husband was a robber, saying he was in the dairy business at Muzzarfarpur, near New Delhi. Mrs. Tyagi's Version of Events On the day of the incident, she said, she and her husband and his friends were driving in a rented car to her village for the marriage of her niece. She said that when they were near the Baghpat police station the car developed a flat tire and the men went out to look for a repair shop. While she was sitting in the car, she said, a man approached and started teasing her. As she protested, her husband returned and slapped the man, who turned out to be a policeman in civilian clothes. The man ran away, she added, but soon returned with a group of policemen holding rifles. ''They shot my husband and his friend as they were pushing the car,'' Mrs. Tyagi said. ''The third man put up his hands in surrender but they killed him too.'' Mrs. Tyagi said the policemen dragged her out of the car, stripped her, tied her to a tree and sexually abused her. She said she was taken to the police station, where she was declared under arrest. Then, according to her brother, Kamal Singh, she was raped by nine policemen. She was later taken in custody to a hospital and after three days released on bail. The police have charged Mrs. Tyagis with being an accessory to murder and robbery. Mr. Gaur, who took up office in Baghpat two months ago, is still in the post. Eight other policemen involved in the incident have been transferred. Lok Dal, the party of former Prime Minister Charan Singh, which predominates in this area, has demanded that the policemen be suspended. Several hundred party workers have defied a police ban on assembling in public and have been jailed. Mrs.  Gandhi's Congress Party supports the police version of the incident. Few local residents, however, share this belief. ''It was the policemen who fired the shots,'' said an elderly shopkeeper who asserted that he witnessed the incident. ''They did all those disgraceful acts on the poor girl. If those dacoits fired back at least one policeman and some in the crowd must have been hurt. They were no dacoits. They were unarmed, just people like us.''",1980,"India"

"50","Police Protect Women During Indian Festival","Asia","From behind a formidable steel gate at the Saint Stephens College women's hostel at Delhi University, three students spoke hesitantly to a visitor today, refusing to open more than a small peephole and admitting, finally, that they were virtual captives for the day in their dormitory compound. In the street outside, bands of young men raced by on motorcycles, emitting raucous whoops and wolf whistles, and occasionally making lewd comments before roaring away in pursuit of girls bold enough to venture outside. The young men's faces and clothes were garishly streaked with chartreuse, red and green dye, and some of them were obviously drunk or high on bhang, an opium derivative. Asked if she felt in danger, one of the young women replied, ""I guess that's why we're locked in here. Most people are staying inside today."" The anxiety was caused by the festival of Holi, an annual rite of spring in India, the origins of which are symbolic of fertility and defloration, and are steeped in Hindu mythology. In its most innocent form, Holi (pronounced holy) is an occasion when families, friends and neighbors smear brightly colored liquid dye on each other, gaily sing and dance and celebrate the onset of summer and the harvest season. At its worst, Holi is a terrifying day for millions of Indian women, one in which the ugliest manifestations of sexual repression in tradition-bound Indian society are released. It is a day when law enforcement authorities often wink at verbal sexual abuse and even physical molestation with a casual ""Boys will be boys."" This year, however, the police finally responded to pressure from women's rights groups and student organizations and launched a ""curb Holi hooliganism"" campaign that appeared to be at least partially effective in many parts of the capital. The deputy chief of the Delhi police, Ahmed Qumar, said that complaints of sexual harassment and violence declined partly because of the new crackdown, but also because thousands of young rank-and-file workers of India's dominant political party, the Congress (I), were not observing the holiday because of the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi Oct. 31. Sikh youths, Qumar noted, also were foregoing the celebration because of the Hindu-mob massacre of more than 2,000 Sikhs that followed the assassination. Women's colleges throughout the capital were heavily patrolled today, and plainclothes policemen and decoy policewomen were posted on public buses in an attempt to curtail molesting of young women. The city government banned the sale of water balloons, which traditionally are thrown at women on Holi, and the authorities warned that anyone who ""played Holi"" by smearing red dye on unwilling persons would be arrested. Nearly 100 young men identified as ""miscreants"" were arrested under preventive detention orders in an attempt to combat Holi hooliganism. However, for several days before today's festival, there were numerous reports of pre-Holi ""Eve teasing"" -- a popular Indian euphemism for sexual harassment of women -- particularly on buses near women's colleges. By legal definition under the penal code, an offense is committed ""when a man by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representation or by gestures does at any public place sing, recite or utter indecent words or song or ballad to the annoyance of any woman."" In practice, Eve-teasing has a wider definition that includes fondling and pinching women on crowded buses, often by groups of several young men; lewd taunting and jeering at women by roving gangs of youths, who sometimes tear the clothes off their victims or spit on them, and, occasionally, beating women who attempt to summon help. Women's rights activists frequently have complained that other passengers and even policemen and bus conductors riding on public buses routinely turn a blind eye when women are assaulted or verbally abused during the Holi season, either because they do not not take the offense seriously or because they are intimidated by the young goondas (street toughs). ""In the past few years society has begun to respond to this unkind view of women. The girls are beginning to articulate their protest. They want to be treated as human beings rather than as women, so naturally there has been some resistance from the other sex,"" said S.C. Bhatiya, a professor at Saint Stephen's college who was manning a special anti-hooliganism control room on the campus today. Bhatiya said college rules provide for the expulsion of Eve-teasers, but he said he could think of ""no substantial cases"" that had been pressed in the last three years. The principal of Daulat Ram Women's College, Deepali Chandra, said the often vicious harassment of women at Holi may stem from the frustration young Indian men experience because of the vast gulf between the fantasy of the movies they watch and the reality of a sexually repressed society. ""The media presents a picture they do not not see in real life. In actual practice, there is no ground where boy meets girl in such a romantic way. So when it actually happens, they don't know how to respond to a situation. At Holi, you are allowed certain liberties. It provides an occasion once a year when one has an outlet for his frustration,"" Chandra said in an interview. Moreover, she added, the practice of disguising faces on Holi with thick colored dye provides ""a cloak behind which they can let out their frustrations against girls."" The origins of Holi have been obscured by time, but the festival has been associated with several gods of Hindu mythology, including Kama, the god of pleasure.",1985,"India"
"51","For Women in India Prisons, a 'Grim Picture'","Asia","An official study of women in Indian prisons says many of them are beaten, sexually molested or otherwise harassed in jail. It said most women prisoners live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions and often rear their children in jail. The report said the difficulties of women prisoners are ''an extension of the general indifference that Indian society shows to the woman.'' More than 17 percent of all unconvicted women prisoners in India are mentally unstable and have been placed in jail despite a lack of mental health care, according to the report, which was recently submitted to the Government by the National Expert Committee on Women Prisoners. The report attributes the practice to official callousness. ''It paints a very grim picture,'' said Margaret Alva, Minister of State for Human Resources in Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Government. Mrs. Alva, who commissioned the report, said in an interview that she had found that many women prisoners were ''ignorant of their rights, and unaware that they could get bail.'' Mrs. Alva, a prominent spokeswoman for women's rights in India, said the stigma of a jail term sometimes ruined a woman's life because her family would refuse to take her back even after her release. Indian prison conditions have been widely viewed as extremely wretched for both men and women, as a 1983 report said. That report, ordered by Indira Gandhi, who was then Prime Minister, stressed that at the time India had more than 87,000 captives who were held without trial, often for petty offenses. The latest report presents disturbing descriptions of life in prison for women. It was written by an 11-member committee, including seven women. The panel was headed by a former Supreme Court judge, a man, and its members included prominent Government officials, lawyers and a journalist. Often, women preferred to stay in prison even after they were released because of social ostracism, the report said. Indian law permits women who are destitute or mental patients to be kept in jail until alternative accommodation is found for them. The number of women in Indian jails is small compared to the total prison population - about 4,000 of about 107,000 in 1985, the year for which the latest Government figures are available. About 44,000 women are arrested every year, compared to more than 2 million men. Many women are charged with petty crimes, such as stealing. Others are charged with more serious offenses such as murder and kidnapping. Prison authorities often agree to allow mothers to keep their children with them in prison, although teen-age children are sometimes sent to reform schools or to live with other relatives. Separate prisons are available only for one-fourth of the total population of women in jail. The others are housed in segregated wings of prisons for men. The committee has recommended that all mentally disturbed women be taken out of prisons and placed in psychiatric or mental health centers. 'Human Rights Cannot Survive' During one visit, the chairman of the committee, Justice V. K. Krishna Iyer, noted that 15 women in one cell ''had no access to any of the amenities - clothing, work education or even medical examination.'' ''There were no beds, bedsheets or pillows, just a cane mat,'' the justice added. ''Human rights cannot survive in such jails.'' The committee writes of ''beating and specified tortures like hitting with bamboo sticks, straps, etc.'' ''The women police themselves have been reported to slap the female arrestees and to handle them roughly,'' the committee added. It also reported that women have been raped and sexually molested in custody. Although the committee has suggested wide-ranging changes, including a national policy on care and rehabilitation of women prisoners, officials acknowledge that it will take several years to carry out such changes.",1988,"India"
"52","Delhi Lawyers End Strike Over Police Official","Asia","A bitter 75-day strike by lawyers ended in a new flood of controversy this week, as the authorities bowed to the lawyers and removed one of the highest ranking women in India from her post as deputy commissioner of police in New Delhi. In ending their strike, New Delhi's lawyers nonetheless vowed to press for the suspension of the police official, Kiran Bedi, from any Government post. Some lawyers said they would not rest until she was put in jail. The lawyers, who once mounted a nationwide strike that brought a temporary halt to the Indian criminal justice system, accused Mrs. Bedi of ''dereliction of duty'' in reportedly failing to prevent attacks on them in January and February. Mrs. Bedi, who is 39 years old, had earlier become known throughout India because of many battles against the establishment. Many women looked to her as an example of advancement in traditionally male-dominated preserves. The first woman to join the Indian police force, Mrs. Bedi once personally led a charge against rowdy demonstrators. Later, while in charge of the traffic police, she ordered the towing away of cars throughout New Delhi, including the car of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Now Mrs. Bedi and her many supporters charge that the lawyers singled her out because of her honesty and courage in again refusing to give special treatment to powerful groups. A typical letter to the editor said she had obviously ''interfered with things that she really shouldn't have, like criminals, illegal trade and other undesirable activities.'' Mrs. Bedi said in an interview that she would not give up her fights or her tactics. ''Mentally, I am preparing for a five-year battle,'' she said. ''All my life has been devoted to fighting injustice for others. This is the first time I've had to fight injustice for myself.'' Several groups, including women's groups, have come to Mrs. Bedi's defense and criticized the Government for transferring her, even though the shift was not considered a demotion. In her new post as director of investigations of narcotics traffic throughout the country, she may at least be less visible for a time, police officials say. The unusual fight between Mrs. Bedi and the New Delhi legal establishment began in January with the arrest and handcuffing of a lawyer for petty theft. Lawyers at the main court complex in the old part of the city immediately went on strike, charging that lawyers were not supposed to be handcuffed in such cases. The strike quickly spread nationwide and led to two violent clashes, in which the lawyers charged that Mrs. Bedi had failed to protect them. Her Office Is Stormed In the first, on Jan. 18, lawyers demonstrating at Mrs. Bedi's office accused the police of using excessive force against them. Mrs. Bedi said the lawyers had stormed her office, shouting obscenities and threatening to rip her clothes off, and that the police had used reasonable force in repelling them. A few weeks later, hundreds of other demonstrators, this time backing Mrs. Bedi, fought with a group of lawyers in a stone-throwing clash broken up by the police. Two dozen people were injured, and the lawyers accused Mrs. Bedi of laxity. A two-judge panel looking into the incidents reported evidence of police lapses but said it needed more evidence before it concluded that Mrs. Bedi was personally responsible. Mrs. Bedi charges that many lawyers have told her they backed her version of the events, but she said they appeared afraid to say so publicly. Defenders of Mrs. Bedi say that they expect her to remain in the public eye no matter what job she holds, and that she might eventually go into politics. But a senior police official who supports her said she needed to learn how to be less confrontational and self-righteous in her approach.",1988,"India"
"53","China's Racial Unrest Spreads to Beijing Campus","Asia","China's racial unrest spread to Beijing today, with a march by Chinese students to protest what they said were assaults by African students on Chinese women. About 150 students took part in the march around the campus of the Beijing Languages Institute, and as many as 2,000 boycotted classes at the institute, where Chinese study foreign languages and foreigners study Chinese. The protesters carried banners with such slogans as ''Hooligans Go Home,'' ''Protect Women's Rights'' and ''We Demand a Safe Campus.'' At the same time, angry posters were illegally stuck to walls at Beijing University. The unrest began Dec. 24 with an interracial brawl in the Eastern city of Nanjing, leading to demonstrations by thousands of Chinese calling for punishment of the Africans involved in the fight. The racial confrontation then spread to the nearby city of Hangzhou, where African students briefly kidnapped a university official and then began boycotting classes to protest what they said was officially sanctioned racism. Largest Protest in 2 Years Today's demonstration and posters were nominally directed at a small number of African students, but in China they inevitably took on a political tone. Implicit in the protests was the suggestion that the Government gives preference to foreigners and does not adequately protect Chinese women from African students. The demonstrations last week in Nanjing were the largest since pro-democracy marches around the country two years ago led to the purge of the Communist Party leader, Hu Yaobang, and to a crackdown on intellectuals. The spread to the capital is significant because that is where unrest is most likely to have a political effect. For example, Beijing University, where the posters were put up, is the country's most famous institution and is attended by the sons and daughters of many leading officials. The march and the posters were prompted by an incident early Sunday morning in which a Chinese woman was said to have been attacked by an African student in her dormitory. The marchers said the woman was injured when she fell trying to escape. ''Such things have taken place many times,'' read a statement distributed by the marchers. ''This time we want the authorities to arrest the criminal and deal with it according to law.'' Boycott Is Begun One marcher said: ''We're not against all Africans, but only those who molest our women. They must be punished and expelled.'' In Nanjing, where the unrest began, African students who have been released by the police said today that they had begun boycotting classes until their fellow students were also released. Some 140 African students, nearly all of those in Nanjing, were rounded up a week ago and taken to a Government guest house to protect them from Chinese screaming racial epithets. But the police then refused to allow them to leave except to return to their universities, where most of the Africans said they felt unsafe. More of the Africans were returned to their dormitories today, leaving about 50 still still confined to a guest house or military base in the area. The Chinese Government says that one has been arrested for his role in the brawl that touched off the disturbances, but African students say that at least six others also have been arrested. Most of the seven who have been arrested, they say, were not involved in the initial fight but are leaders of an African students' committee that has condemned racism in Nanjing. The students today repeated charges that some of their leaders had been tortured by police; they said they were made to stand naked outside in freezing weather while they were beaten and shocked on the genitals with electric cattle prods. A European student who was with the Africans at the time, but declined to give her name, confirmed their account. The African students in Nanjing also reported that Africans studying in Shanghai today began to boycott classes and would continue to do so until the police released everyone detained in Nanjing. The report could not be independently confirmed.",1989,"China"
"54","India Women Feel Harassed By Hindu Rite","Asia","Vimla Mehra, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, is getting ready for Holi, the most joyous of Northern Indian festivals, a Hindu rite of spring. ''We are going to increase the number of police brigades around all the women's colleges,'' she told a visitor. ''We will set up a special control room at Delhi University. We will deploy women officers in the streets.'' ''Holi is a spring festival,'' said Sudhir Kakar, an authority on love and sexuality in India. ''But that has nothing to do with what it has become.'' The holiday, which this year falls on March 21 and 22 in India, was traditionally a day to abandon inhibitions and fears - not only in relations between the sexes but among the castes and between the poor and those in authority. It was a day to throw brightly colored powders or buckets of water on friends; there are many parties. ''But it has now led to the worst kind of sexual harassment,'' Mr. Kakar said. Two of the measures of the growing importance of women's organizations in India, and the influence of women in authority like Commissioner Mehra, are the vocal criticism of the excesses of Holi and the determination of the Government to put a stop to them without spoiling the fun of the day. A bill in Parliament that would deny bail to men arrested for molesting women is a step forward, Talveen Singh, a columnist for several Indian newspapers, said. She said that while most people still managed to have a lot of harmless fun, the season lends itself to abuse by goondas, or miscreants. Abusive Behavior by Men At Holi, men engage in what the Indians still call 'Eve teasing,' a term rejected as too benign by many women who say it covers not only verbal harassment and offensive, suggestive language, but also physical harassment such as fondling or pinching. Commissioner Mehra, director of a special police branch set up five years ago to deal with crimes against women, said there are few if any rapes reported during Holi, but that that is not the issue. In the strict social structure of Indian families, where wives and husbands often meet for the first time at arranged betrothals and there is no Western-style courtship, a young woman would be terrified and feel violated by being touched, she said. At one of the women's residence halls at Delhi University, where there were attacks on women last year, the housemother told a reporter this week that she would lock all her charges inside the walled quadrangle grounds for Holi. One of the students living in the hall said she would not go to classes for two or three days before and after the holiday ''because I would have to go out in the street.'' ''At least I don't have to take a bus,'' she said with relief. Sexual abuse of young women on buses is common in the city, students say. Mr. Kakar, who has just completed a book called Intimate Relations in India to be published by the University of Chicago Press in July, said it was interesting that as Holi has become more associated with the abandonment of sexual inhibitions, it has also become more of a Krishna cult festival. ''Krishna, of course, is the model for that,'' he said of the Hindu god who is colored blue in paintings that often show him frolicking with cowherd women called gopis who distract him from his true love, Radha.",1989,"India"
"55","Tokyo Journal; Sex Harassment: Glare of Light on a Man's World","Asia","Six months after joining a publishing company in southern Japan as a clerical worker, Miss H. heard the first office rumors about her supposed affairs. A senior editor, she learned later, found her behavior ''coquettish'' and was spreading false gossip. Miss H., a 32-year-old unmarried woman who has asked the press to withhold her name, went to the editor and demanded that he stop. There was a messy confrontation, which ended when the company director dismissed her but suspended the editor for only three days. When Miss H. sought compensation from a local court, two arbitrators, a man and a woman, said the rumors were a tribute to her attractiveness. ''They told me I was behaving ridiculously,'' Miss H. recalled in an interview. ''They said, 'These rumors are better than no rumors at all.' '' Eventually, Miss H. found two feminist lawyers in Fukuoka to file the first lawsuit in Japan charging ''sexual harassment.'' The suit has helped spawn an intense debate in offices across Japan about the difference between innocent and offensive sexual behavior. An Alien Concept A few years ago, virtually no one in Japan had heard of sexual harassment. Indeed, the appropriation of the term from English demonstrates to some feminists how alien the concept is from Japanese traditions, in which sexual approaches to women at the workplace are often considered acceptable. But today Japanese lawyers and feminists have brought sexual harassment to the forefront with a flurry of surveys, studies, articles, legal actions, conferences and organizing. Their activity is another sign of awakening feminist consciousness in a male-dominated society, particularly the office, where women are slowly growing restive over their low pay, status and promotion prospects. Among the symbols of such discrimination is the standard requirement that women, no matter what their status, serve tea to men. In 1987, the Tokyo Office of Labor Problem Consultation recorded one sex-related complaint, from a woman charging she had been sexually assaulted while on a business trip with the company president. Today the office receives 10 such cases a month and the numbers are increasing. Labor Group Holds Seminar Japan's largest federation of labor unions held a seminar on sexual harassment recently and announced a survey of its members. Many news organizations are also sponsoring surveys, and feminist groups are distributing translated handbooks from the United States and Europe. In addition, a division of the Tokyo Bar Association recently set up its own committee, which operated a one-day telephone ''hot line'' that drew enormous attention last month when more than a third of the 138 callers said they had been seduced, assaulted or pressed to have sex at the workplace. ''Although women's status is improving, a lot of issues are escaping attention,'' said Shizuko Sugii, a Bar Association official. ''Right now there is no law forbidding trivial behavior, like making a crude or offensive sexual comment to a woman in the office. That is something we want to change.'' Generally, the campaigners define sexual harassment as something other than rape or assault. They say it involves any behavior that denigrates, embarrasses or compromises women in the office or at the myriad outings or drinking sessions that are standard fare for most Japanese businesses. But the concept is so new that, beyond assault, no consensus exists on what constitutes a grievance. Japanese magazines are filled with arguments, for instance, about whether it is proper for a man to put a nude pin-up at his desk, inquire about someone's sex life, pat a woman on the rear or make a suggestive comment. 'Men Are Confused' The publicity has already brought a backlash, with some commentators dismissing the movement as a passing fad imported from the United States. A columnist for Themis magazine, a glossy weekly, complained, for instance, that an executive ought to be able to innocently ask his secretary about the color of her underwear that day. Actions by feminists are a staple of the news nowadays, including a recent successful move by a women's group to get a liquor advertisement withdrawn. The advertisement showed a woman in a disheveled and revealing cowboy outfit, her face and clothes smudged by dirt, and some viewed it as a suggestion of rape. Increasing attention is also being paid to discrimination against women in jobs, despite the enactment of an equal employment opportunity law in 1986. The law forbids discrimination on the basis of sex but has no penalties for companies that do not comply. Surveys show that Japanese businesses employ minuscule numbers of women in management positions, even though the Japanese work force is about 40 percent female. Since most women quit their jobs when they marry, they tend to be relegated to low-level positions in which they are known as ''office ladies,'' or ''O.L.'s.'' One cause of sexual harassment, many analysts say, is that the Japanese office plays a much more important role in the social and personal lives of employees than in the United States. Young workers especially stay late at the office or go out drinking together rather than head home. Attendance is also expected at numerous company picnics and outings. Not everyone feels that men are always guilty of sexual harassment and that lawsuits are a solution. One skeptic is Chinami Shimizu, author of a weekly magazine column in which 800 ''office ladies'' and others write in about the peccadillos of men in their offices. More Understanding Urged ''Usually there is no malicious intention by the man,'' said Miss Shimizu, a former office worker herself. ''If it's just a matter of some man saying something, the solution is to increase understanding among women and men. I don't think lawsuits should be filed except in cases of rape or assault.'' In any case, many lawyers doubt that lawsuits will ever become widespread in Japan, since they usually involve a baring of someone's private life and a drawn-out court battle. Miss H., the aggrieved woman from Fukuoka whose lawsuit has become a focus of concern, said she shared these misgivings. ''I worry about the media publicity making women hold back,'' she said. ''It's like what rape cases in court do to a woman, when the victim is raped again right there in the courtroom.''",1989,"Japan"
"56","Feudal China's Evil Revived: Wives for Sale","Asia","The television scene shows two young women being led to a suburban home where they are told they will be given lucrative new jobs. They wait in a small, locked room and soon discover to their horror the real nature of the deal: they are being sold, for about $950 each. The television dramatization is one of a few tools the Government is using to warn women about a feudalistic practice that is doggedly making its way back into rural China: the buying and selling of women to serve as wives. The partial emergence of a market economy has reinvigorated this variation of slavery, as travel becomes easier and peasants accumulate enough cash to purchase a bride. No one knows quite how common the sale of wives is, but it almost certainly is increasing rapidly. Confidential documents presented recently to China's legislature say that the authorities investigated 18,692 cases of women being sold against their will last year, and presumably many more cases never came to the attention of the authorities. The documents say that 65,236 people have been arrested in the last two years for involvement in the sale of women and children. ""There are some comrade leaders who do not recognize the threat and the seriousness of this repulsive social phenomenon,"" says one of the internal documents. ""Some cadres and party members at the grass roots even connive at, participate in and support the criminal activity of the kidnapping and sale of women."" The documents were circulated to the standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's legislature. In June, the standing committee discussed stricter punishments for traffickers of women and children, a spokesman said. The sale of women disappeared during the first 20 years of Communist rule, and slowly reappeared during the 1970's and 1980's. The number of cases has risen sharply since 1985, the documents say. In rural areas, a bride's family traditionally will insist on a wedding ceremony, and these days the cost of weddings has soared, as neighbors try to outdo each other. That has created a strong incentive to buy a wife and save the cost of the festivities. A wife typically costs less than $1,000, compared to $700 to $3,000 for a wedding, and the family of the purchased bride is obviously not around to insist on a lavish wedding. Some of the women are foreigners, mostly Vietnamese. Last year, at least 2,716 Vietnamese women were repatriated after being kidnapped and sold, although the documents did not make clear how they came to China in the first place. The typical Chinese victim is a woman from a poor region who is lured by the prospect of a new job, a better life, or free travel, to follow a trafficker to another province. Once she is in his hands, the trafficker essentially kidnaps her, often beating or raping her. Sometimes the process of abduction can involve a network of more than 100 traffickers. The women are often young and unsophisticated and have no idea how they could escape, even if they had money for bus fares. In addition, they are sometimes locked up until they have borne children, and frequently local villagers side with the man who has parted with his life savings to buy a wife. ""After some of the women are abducted and sold, they are stripped of their freedom for a long time and endure the inhuman life of imprisonment and devastation,"" says one of the documents. ""The criminal activity of the kidnap and sale of women more and more has come to resemble the slave trade."" One document also criticized the current legal regulations for trafficking, which essentially stipulate that a common trafficker, who is not a gang leader or a rapist, is sentenced to less than five years. That same sentence is given to a thief who has stolen a head of cattle worth less than $200. But in some cases, those who organize trafficking are executed. In June, the authorities executed 10 men in Shanxi Province for selling 91 women.",1991,"China"
"57","Landmark Sex Harassment Case in Japan","Asia","In a decision that marked the first successful legal action against sexual harassment in Japan, a district court ruled today that a company and one of its male employees had violated a woman's rights because of crude remarks that drove her to quit her job. The action by a local court in Fukuoka in southern Japan was featured as a main story in newspapers and television broadcasts this evening as a startling triumph for Japan's small feminist movement that could have far-reaching effects in the workplace. ""This is the first case in which verbal comments by a man have been found to constitute sexual harassment,"" said Yukiko Tsunoda, a lawyer in the case. ""Sexual harassment is a big problem in Japan, and we hope this will send a signal to men that they have to be more careful."" The active women's movement in Japan is minuscule compared with those in other countries and has had few legal victories. The issue of sexual harassment has risen only in the last three years as one of the few major issues the movement has tried to advance. Women's groups and indeed women generally say that sexual approaches by men -- from suggestive remarks to touching -- are the norm in Japanese workplaces. Some 40 percent of Japanese workers are women, but most hold clerical jobs in which they are known as ""office ladies,"" or ""O.L.'s."" The defendants were ordered to pay the woman $12,500 -- less than half what she asked for -- and it was unclear whether they would appeal.  While the names of all the parties in the lawsuit, including the 34-year-old plaintiff, have been withheld to protect their privacy, The Associated Press reported that the defendants were the Kyu Kikaku publishing company and its employee Hidenori Hirotsu. The suit involved an unmarried woman employed by a small publishing company in the city of Fukuoka who argued that one of her supervisors had spread rumors about her, saying she had a reputation for promiscuity. She tried to get him to stop, she testified, but was advised instead to quit. In an interview with The New York Times in 1989, the woman said that she had taken her complaint to two arbitrators, a man and a woman, who told her that she should be flattered by the man's attentions. The lawsuit was the first ever filed in Japan charging sexual harassment. It set off commentary across the country about sexual harassment, stirring debates among men and women in the press and in offices. Many male columnists ridiculed the idea as a passing fad from the United States, saying such lawsuits would spoil the harmony and sense of fun at the workplace. The author of a weekly magazine column for ""office ladies"" said she opposed lawsuits except in cases of rape or assault. A New Term Is Coined The media coined the concept as ""seku hara"" and some bars that specialize in pretty hostesses for men took the term for their name. Men wrote letters complaining that their innocent jokes and remarks were being misinterpreted. The reaction to the ruling today appeared to be generally positive. In a news broadcast about the decision tonight, people interviewed in the streets generally supported it, but a young man smiled and said, ""I agree with it, but I might try sexual harassment some day when I'm older."" There have been harassment cases in the past, but with ambiguous verdicts in which the judges did not actually rule that there was such a thing as sexual harassment. In one case last year, a woman was awarded damages after saying that a man had assaulted her on a business trip. Another received damages after she said a colleague had threatened her when she refused to go to a hotel with him. But those earlier cases were won by the plaintiffs because the men did not show up in court. What distinguished the case in Fukuoka was that it was vigorously contested, and the actions by the man consisted entirely of verbal comments that were not direct threats.",1992,"Japan"
"58","Wako Journal; History Scholar in Japan Exposes a Brutal Chapter","Asia","When Japan's television networks recently began broadcasting the accounts of Korean women and girls who were kidnapped and forced to serve in battlefront brothels for the Imperial Army, even Japanese who prefer never to think about World War II said they felt shamed by the years of agony the women endured. But the Japanese Government had the same ready answer it has had for decades: A few words of sympathy for the tens of thousands of victims whose lives were shattered, and a curt dismissal of their demands for Government compensation. The brothels, Japan's Foreign Ministry said, were run by private entrepreneurs, not the Government. No one in the Foreign Ministry, though, was ready for Yoshiaki Yoshimi. Mr. Yoshimi, a history professor with a a knack for coming up with historical documents that Japan would prefer to keep buried, listened to the Government's assertions on television in his cramped apartment here last month and knew immediately that the Government was rewriting history. ""I was outraged,"" he said the other day. ""And I knew that clear evidence existed that would force the Government to acknowledge its responsibility."" Debunking the Myth Over the last three weeks, Mr. Yoshimi singlehandedly debunked the myth that the Japanese Government had not organized and run the brothels. He created a sensation in Tokyo and Seoul and forced Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to issue a formal apology to the Korean people. This week, reversing decades of flat refusals, Mr. Miyazawa conceded that the Government would have to find some way of redressing the women's grievances, though he stopped short of promising financial reparations to what Japan euphemistically calls the ""comfort women."" In Japan, social pressures not to challenge the status quo are overwhelming. War atrocities are a particular taboo. ""I have lived here all my life, and I know that Japan only talks about half of its history,"" Mr. Yoshimi said. ""The half where Japan is victimized."" It is widely believed that Japan started building ""comfort stations"" in the mid-1930's, and 100,000 to 200,000 women were eventually lured or dragged to Japanese battlefronts across Asia. Most were children and teen-agers from Korea, a Japanese colony from 1910 to 1945, but many others came from China and a few from Japan itself. Confined to filthy shanties, the women were forced to have sex with soldiers, who were often rotated through the ""comfort stations"" day and night at 15 minute intervals. Venereal disease was rampant. Thousands of the women died, including many who were apparently killed by soldiers. Virginity is a virtual requisite for marriage in Korean society, and many of the survivors were shunned by their families when they returned. Until recently South Korea's school textbooks, like Japan's, have scarcely mentioned the women's plight. With news organizations focused on the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, however, a few of the surviving Korean ""comfort women"" decided the moment was ripe to press their case. Three came to Tokyo in December to file a damages suit against the Japanese Government, prompting the Government's chief spokesman, Koichi Kato, to reiterate that Japan considered all of its war reparations to South Korea paid, and to deny that the army had organized or run the brothels. Apart from the ""comfort women"" themselves, no one seemed ready to dispute that reading of history. But as he watched on television, Mr. Yoshimi recalled that a few years ago, combing through the Self-Defense Agency's library to research Japan's use of poison gas during the war, he had tripped across a military order to set up a brothel. Born outside Hiroshima in 1946, Mr. Yoshimi has spent his professional life trying to get a glimpse of a war he is too young to remember. ""I grew up hearing my older brothers and sisters tell about the day they saw a mushroom cloud erupt from the center of the city,"" he said. ""I could feel the war misery. I've always wanted to grasp what happened."" Certain that more documents existed that would disprove the Government's contention, Mr. Yoshimi returned to the library over the New Year's holiday. In two days of searching, he came up with a small trove, including one document titled ""Regarding the Recruitment of Women for Military Brothels."" It ordered the quick construction of ""facilities for sexual comfort,"" to stop the troops occupying China from raping women in the regions they controlled. It bears the ""hanko,"" or personal stamps, of leaders of the high command of the Japanese Army. Documents Given to Reporter Mr. Yoshimi handed the documents to a reporter at the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest dailies, just before Mr. Miyazawa traveled to South Korea for a meeting with President Roh Tae Woo. Almost overnight, the Government's arguments collapsed. In South Korea, where anger over the issue was already on the rise, protesters threw rocks at the Japanese Embassy and burned Emperor Akihito in effigy. Mr. Roh's Government has demanded compensation for the women, though Japan still argues that issues of reparation were settled in 1965, in a treaty normalizing relations with Seoul. Korea has retaliated by ordering its school books to be revised with more detailed and graphic accounts of the fate of the women. Back in Tokyo, a telephone line set up last week by groups supporting the comfort women drew 230 calls, the vast majority from men in their 60's and 70's who confirmed that the military established and ran the brothels, and confessed to using them. The Japanese press reported that a 71-year-old Japanese woman, a sixth-grade teacher in Korea during the war, called to tell how she was ordered by the principal to choose ""physically well-developed"" girls for war service. She chose eight girls, thinking, she said, that they would be put to work in an aircraft-parts factory. Back in Korea a few years ago, she visited some other former students and learned the truth. ""I could not meet the women,"" she said. ""They were still too hurt, physically and mentally. I am so very sorry.""",1992,"Japan"
"59","Hundreds Tortured To Death in India, Rights Group Says","Asia","Amnesty International charged today that hundreds of people in India, including pregnant women and children, had died in recent years from beatings and torture while in custody. The London-based human rights group said in a report, its latest on India, that the victims were picked up by the police, illegally detained and tortured for confessions until they died. ""The torture and deaths continue,"" it said, ""because police know there's hardly any chance of the long arm of the law touching them, even if they kill the victim and the truth is revealed."" Amnesty said successive governments had denied that torture took place and had done nothing to stop it.  The victims, some as young as 6, nearly all came from India's poor. They included casteless people, those from low castes and from ethnic minorities, landless laborers and migrant workers, the report said. Amnesty charged that many of the victims were suspended from ceilings in jail cells and given electric shocks or whipped. Others had their legs crushed with heavy rollers, were stabbed with sharp instruments or had chilies inserted in their rectums. Raping of women by police officers is common, particularly in areas of armed insurgency, it added. The report described more than 400 cases. It will be sent to Indian politicians, judges and police officers, among others. Amnesty said senior officials effectively gave the green light to torture in many instances.

"60","Chinese Women Suffer Under a Brutal System","Asia","To the Editor: A. M. Rosenthal enumerates the forms of torture suffered by prisoners in China in ""China's Black Book"" (column, July 7) and eloquently calls on our politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, to speak out against slavery and torture in China. However, Mr. Rosenthal, like Asia Watch, the human rights group he cites, fails to address the widespread slavery and torture suffered by women in China. A recent study on violence against women, written by a Chinese journalist, describes the following human rights violations in China. In rural China, the bride price paid to the bride's family makes it two to three times more expensive to marry a wife than to buy one from a trafficker. In the first 10 months of 1990, 11,689 cases of trafficking were reported. Many women who are kidnapped for trafficking are beaten, raped or gang raped by traffickers -- most on their first night in captivity. They may be as young as 13. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets forth in Article 16 the fundamental human rights principle that ""marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses."" In China, ""huan qin"" is the exchange of wives: families trade unmarried daughters to provide wives for their sons, either because they cannot afford the bride price or because their sons are unable to find brides by reason of mental or physical disabilities. Bride trades and arranged marriages also account for a great number of young suicides in China. In Jia County in Henan Province, based on data collected in 1989, it was estimated in one village that women account for 95 percent of the attempted suicides treated in the village hospital and 70 percent are younger than 30. Many of the women are single and imminently facing marriage. In Laohe Village, a 19-year-old girl drank pesticide to avoid being exchanged for a bride for her 30-year-old unmarried brother. China has an obligation under international law, which prohibits slavery in all forms, to protect women from this systematic abuse, to uphold their right to marry freely, and to prosecute the traffickers and batterers.

"61","Pakistan's Women Suffer Special Abuse","Asia","To the Editor: ""Pakistanis Fear Chaos as Graft and Violence Rise"" (news article, Aug. 2) will not be news to Pakistan's 50 million women, who have been among the most frequent, if often hidden, victims of these abuses. You only hint at how corrupt Pakistan's security apparatus has become. If President Ghulam Ishaq Khan's son-in-law, Irfanullah Khan Marwat, who oversaw Sind Province's most powerful police agency, is notorious for raping airline stewardesses, the police force he helped debase has made rape and other forms of sexual torture a routine part of life in jail for Pakistani women. Sometimes this abuse is politically motivated. Last October the Women's Rights Project and Asia Watch investigated numerous cases of police abuse of women in custody. We interviewed Rahila Tiwana, an activist with Benazir Bhutto's People's Party, who was tortured and sexually assaulted by police from the Crime Investigation Agency. The agency is believed to be responsible (and so far unaccountable) for widespread abuse against other political detainees. But by far the largest number of victims are poor women, many of whom have been denounced under Islamic law for crimes of fornication and adultery. Because the law and the courts discriminate against women, for instance by disallowing their testimony in some situations, they cannot get a fair trial. Many such cases ultimately end in acquittal, but only after the women have endured months or even years of police abuse and unwarranted detention. Since coming to power, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has tried to attract the religious right's support by enforcing these laws and strengthening the Islamic courts. Although the Government has now granted the army new powers to restore law and order, until it insures that the police cannot abuse any prisoner with impunity and that the courts provide all citizens with equal protection of the law, the toll of victims will continue to rise.

Tong Zeng, who works at the China Research Center on Aging, said he delivered the letters to the Japanese Embassy on Friday and had asked for a response within three or four days. The demands for compensation ranged from $40,000 to $120,000, he said.

Protesters in South Korea demanded compensation for the war's ""comfort girls."" Until now, Japan denied involvement, saying private groups were responsible for what Koreans said was the coercion of up to 200,000 women from Korea, then a Japanese colony, into prostitution. But the reported discovery Saturday of documents showing the army's role in the industry forced a government turnaround. ""We would like to express our apologies and contrition,"" said chief government spokesman Koichi Kato. Kato said, however, that Japan would not compensate the victims.",1992,"Japan"
"65","Japan Hasn't Stopped Exploiting Asian Women","Asia","To the Editor: You are right to say that the $1 billion offered by the Japanese Government as ""compensation"" for the hundreds of thousands of Asian women forced into brothels to service Japanese soldiers during World War II is an ""incomplete mode of redress"" (editorial, Sept. 14). Atonement is only meaningful if it comes with a commitment from the Japanese Government to stop the trafficking of women to Japan and to prosecute those who continue to destroy the lives of so many girls and women with impunity. In April 1991, Maricris Sioson, a 22-year-old dancer from the Philippines, arrived in Japan to work at the Faces Club in Fukushima. Five months later she was admitted to a hospital, and on Sept. 14, 1991, she died. Her Japanese death certificate listed hepatitis as the cause of death, but when Ms. Sioson's family opened her coffin back in the Philippines, they saw that she had been badly beaten and stabbed. An autopsy conducted by the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation showed that she had died as a result of traumatic head injuries. She also had two stab wounds: one in the thigh and one in the genital area. A subsequent report from an independent medical examiner engaged by Equality Now concluded that the fatal head trauma was likely caused by a blunt instrument and that Ms. Sioson's death should have been classified as a homicide. A quick probe by the Japanese police concluded that Ms. Sioson died of natural causes, but her relatives have been denied access to full medical reports and police documents. In the same year that Ms. Sioson died, the Philippine Labor Ministry estimated that 80,000 Filipinos, 95 percent of whom were women, went to work in Japan. The vast majority were entertainers, who commonly found their passports confiscated and their salaries withheld until the end of their contract, leaving them at the mercy of their employers. According to the HELP Asian Women's Shelter in Tokyo, many entertainers are forced into prostitution by economic deprivation, virtual imprisonment and physical intimidation. At Senate hearings held in the Philippines after Ms. Sioson's death, Philippine embassy officials testified that 33 Filipino workers had already died in Japan that year and that 12 of these deaths took place in ""suspicious circumstances."" It is alleged that the Yakuza, an organized crime network in Japan, is heavily involved in the trafficking of women for the Japanese sex and entertainment industry. In addition to compensating the survivors of Japanese trafficking in women during World War II, which should be more than just symbolic compensation, the Japanese Government should demonstrate its commitment to respect for women, as well as the rule of law, by prosecuting those responsible for Maricris Sioson's death and proving that it will not tolerate trafficking in women.

"66","Court Grants Writer's Bail In Bangladesh","Asia","A feminist writer who had spent two months in hiding in fear of death threats by Muslim fundamentalists appeared in court under heavy police guard today in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. After being granted bail on a charge of defaming the Muslim faith, the writer, Taslima Nasrin, quickly went into hiding again, saying she still feared for her life despite Government pledges to protect her. A reporter who attended the hearing in the High Court in Dhaka said Ms. Nasrin, whose plight had drawn appeals to the Bangladeshi Government from Western governments and human rights groups, appeared pale and anxious at her 15-minute appearance. The two judges who presided at the hearing freed the writer on a bail bond equivalent to $250. Ms. Nasrin's decision to emerge from hiding followed negotiations between her lawyers and the Government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, which has been badly shaken by the controversy surrounding Ms. Nasrin. New Blasphemy Law Sought The Government's attempts to placate the fundamentalists by bringing the defamation charge appear instead to have encouraged Muslim militants, who have drawn large and unruly crowds into the streets of Dhaka and other cities demanding Ms. Nasrin's death and other steps favored by the militants, including a new blasphemy law. The court hearing today did not address the substance of the charge against Ms. Nasrin. This centers on an interview that appeared in May in a Calcutta newspaper, in which Ms. Nasrin was quoted as having said that the Koran, the Muslim holy book, should be ""revised thoroughly"" to eliminate elements that encouraged discrimination against women. Ms. Nasrin later issued a statement saying she had been misquoted, and said that what she had called for was the revision of the sharia, the Islamic legal code. In arguing for bail, Ms. Nasrin's lawyer, Kamal Hossain, appeared to hold out an olive branch to the fundamentalists. Seek to Reduce Tensions ""The petitioner never offered any words of the kind alleged, nor had any intention whatsoever to injure the religious feelings of any person,"" Mr. Hossain said. ""If the words mistakenly ascribed to her have caused injury to religious feelings of any person, the petitioner regrets this and is genuinely sorry."" The Government's representatives and the judges also appeared keen to reduce the tensions generated by the affair. Attorney General Aminul Huq, appearing in person for the Government, offered no arguments to support the defamation charge. One of the two judges, A. K. Sadek, asked Ms. Nasrin to remove the headscarf that she wore to court, apparently in deference to Muslim strictures requiring women to cover their heads, and nodded in apparent sympathy when the writer explained her delay in appearing before the court. ""Why didn't you surrender before, and why did you go underground?"" the judge asked Ms. Nasrin. She replied, ""I did so for fear of my life."" On Friday, a crowd estimated by news agencies at 200,000 people gathered in Dhaka to support the militants' demands for Ms. Nasrin's death, and one militant faction was reported to have formed a 100-man ""death squad"" to kill the writer. Government Pledges Safety Security at the courthouse was tight today, with four truckloads of riot policemen deployed in and around the building when Ms. Nasrin appeared, and the courtroom itself was packed with armed police officers. Mr. Huq told reporters that the Government vouched for Ms. Nasrin's safety. ""The Government will do whatever necessary to protect Nasrin,"" Mr. Huq said. The Government did not ask for restrictive conditions on Ms. Nasrin's bail, such as the surrender of her passport. Western diplomats familiar with the negotiations between Ms. Nasrin's lawyers and the Government said before her court appearance that the Government appeared ready to allow Ms. Nasrin to use her period on bail to leave the country for a new refuge abroad -- possibly in Europe, where the 12 nations of the European Union have made a formal offer of asylum to the writer. But it remained unclear after today's events whether the Government remained open to Ms. Nasrin's leaving the country, or whether the writer would take up the opportunity. Immediately after the court hearing, Ms. Nasrin was driven through Dhaka with a heavy police escort to the apartment she left two months ago. There, she met briefly with her mother and other members of her family before leaving again, still under police guard, for an undisclosed location. An Associated Press account described emotional scenes as the writer met her family, with Ms. Nasrin weeping as she hugged her mother. The news agency quoted Ms. Nasrin as having said that she lived in constant fear of attack during her eight weeks in hiding. ""I had heard that the fundamentalists had formed death squads for me,"" she told The A.P. ""So I was under constant fear that I would be hit by a sniper's bullet.""",1994,"Bangladesh"

Ms. Nasrin, whose case has drawn comparisons with that of Salman Rushdie, spent two months as a fugitive in her own country before appearing in a courtroom last week to face charges of defaming Islam. Fundamentalists in Bangladesh denounced the Government for allowing her to depart. But the Government said she acted within her rights, since she had been freed on bail and alerted a judge to her travel plans. Ms. Nasrin has denied accusations that she demanded revisions in the Koran, but she has alienated many fundamentalists by calling for more freedom for women in Bangladesh.

"68","Japan Plans Payment for Forcing Women Into Brothels During War","Asia","Seeking to resolve an issue that still haunts its dealings with its neighbors, Japan has decided to commit $1 billion to programs intended as symbolic compensation to tens of thousands of women from Korea and other nations who were forced to have sex with Japanese soldiers during World War II. Under the plan, which the Goverment will announce today, the money would be spent over 10 years on programs such as youth exchanges with other Asian nations and on support for historical research on Japan's wartime activities, officials said. Japan is also planning to build a vocational training center for women in the Philippines. But the plan, which is also directed at other victims of Japan's wartime aggression, is not expected to satisfy groups representing the women because it does not include direct payments from Japan's Government to the victims. The plan is the latest in a series of grudging steps by Japan to acknowledge the scope of its wartime brutality, including the vast network of military brothels that it established from China to Southeast Asia to the South Pacific during the war. After decades of denials, the Japanese Government acknowledged only in 1992 that the brothels existed; it offered a fuller accounting and an apology last year. Historians have estimated that as many as 200,000 women and teen-age girls were forced to work in the brothels between 1932, soon after Japan's invasion of Manchuria, and the end of the war in 1945. The victims included Koreans, Chinese and Philippine women, as well as some Dutch women captured in Indonesia, then a Dutch colony. Although officials have been hinting for months that some form of financial aid might be forthcoming, Japan has formally avoided using the term ""compensation"" for fear of opening a Pandora's box of claims from other victims -- British prisoners of war, Koreans who were forced to work in Japanese factories or to fight for the Japanese Army, and countless other people. Tokyo still maintains that the issue of compensation has already been settled by agreements it reached with other governments after the war. Indeed, today's announcement will not even mention the term compensation, officials said. Rather the program will be called the ""Peace, Friendship and Exchange Initiative."" Japan is nonetheless considering setting up a mechanism under which individuals and corporations could contribute privately to a fund that would be used to compensate the women. There has been considerable debate within the Government as to whether such a plan would be proper and feasible and nothing has been decided. So today's announcement will only make vague reference to the idea. Visit to Southeast Asia Significantly, the announcement is coming just after Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama returned from an eight-day trip to Southeast Asia, where he was constantly confronted with lingering bitterness over Japan's aggression in the 1930's and 1940's. ""My heart aches when I think about this issue,"" Mr. Murayama is reported to have told the President of the Philippines, Fidel V. Ramos, last week, in a reference to the women who were forced into servitude. During his visit, women staged a protest in Manila to press their demand for direct compensation. The announcement, which is also expected to mention other Asian victims of Japan's wartime aggression, is expected to contain only the bare outlines of a plan that will be more fully formulated in the next year, in time to be announced on the 50th anniversary of the war's end next August. Japan needs to resolve the issues of the war to prevent them from interfering with its economic and political ties with other Asian nations, which are becoming increasingly important markets for Japanese products as well as manufacturing bases for Japanese companies looking to escape the high costs of their own country. But anything short of direct compensation might not satisfy the war victims. Objection by Philippine Paper In an editorial last week, The Manila Chronicle said the plan to open a vocational center in the Philippines in lieu of direct compensation is ""to say the least, disappointing."" ""Verbal apologies, paltry livelihood training and token aid channeled by Japanese officialdom through nongovernment sources is clearly not enough,"" the newspaper said. It called for direct compensation and a written apology. Some women who were made to work in the brothel system have claimed they were forced at gunpoint to leave their villages or were told that they were going to manufacturing jobs. Living in often-filthy barracks, many were forced to have sex with anywhere from 20 to even 50 men a day. Historians say that thousands of the women died. For decades after the war, the women who survived, most of whom were in Korea, hid their past for fear that they would be ostracized. But a few years ago, some came forward demanding compensation. Denials, Then Admissions At first, Japan denied it forced the women to have sex. Three years ago, Japan acknowledged the brothels existed but said they were run by businessmen, not the Government. But the next year, after a history professor released documents he discovered in Japan's military archives, the Government admitted that the military had organized the brothels. But it said there was no evidence that the women were coerced into working in them. Then last year the Government released a more detailed report that conceded that some women were indeed forced to provide sex. Japan has in general had trouble coming to grips with is behavior during the war. School textbooks mention little about Japan's aggression. And even as Japan has been trying to smooth relations with its Asian neighbors, two Cabinet ministers have been forced to resign in the last few months after making comments that made light of Japan's wartime acts. Prime Minister Murayama is the first Prime Minister in more than four decades from the Socialist Party, which adheres to pacifist policies and is thought to be more amenable to compensation. But the Socialists share power with the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, which ruled Japan for most of the postwar period and has said in the past that the issue of compensation is closed. While many of the women have publicly demanded compensation, some Asian governments have taken a more forgiving tone. Last year President Kim Young Sam of South Korea said his nation would not ask for financial compensation from Tokyo if Japan fully admitted what it did during the war.",1994,"Japan"

"71","A Feminist Writer's Defiance Fuels Militants in Bangladesh","Asia","After more than a month in hiding, a feminist writer who has been threatened with death by Muslim clerics remains out of sight. And the controversy surrounding critical remarks she is alleged to have made about the Koran continues to foster an atmosphere of political crisis. The Government brought criminal charges of insulting the Muslim religion against the writer, Taslima Nasrin, on June 4, prompting her to go underground. Rumors then swept this capital that she had sought refuge from angry demonstrators in a Western embassy. At one point, Muslim clerics threatened to march on the United States Embassy in the city's Baridhara diplomatic district, apparently suspicious that Miss Nasrin might be harbored there. An Appeal for Western Help But associates of Miss Nasrin, 32, a doctor who quit her Government job last year when the attacks on her began, say that she is not in any of the score of embassies here. And American diplomats insist that she is not in the United States mission, although she has appealed in messages smuggled out of her refuge for help from Western governments, writers' groups and human rights organizations in securing her safe passage out of Bangladesh. According to several people who know Miss Nasrin well, her most likely hiding place is a private house in this city of seven million people, or perhaps in one of the villages that dot the water-laced landscape of rice paddies outside the capital. An Aug. 4 Deadline Last week, Dhaka's chief magistrate set a deadline of Aug. 4 for her to appear in court and enter a plea in the case. Among Government officials and friends of Miss Nasrin, the hope is that her lawyers will persuade the Government to allow the fugitive writer to appear briefly in court under heavy security, obtain bail, then leave the country immediately, possibly for Norway, which has said that it might grant her asylum, or for the United States. Muslim fundamentalist groups have threatened to disrupt any deal that does not bring Miss Nasrin to trial. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zahid Hossain, said the charge against Miss Nasrin would not be dropped. ""She must appear in court,"" he said. She Faces Two Years in Jail The writer faces a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment under a little-used section of the Bangladesh penal code that proscribes statements or writings ""intended to outrage the religious feeling of any class by insulting its religion or religious believers."" What caused an explosion among Muslim fundamentalist groups, and demands for Miss Nasrin's death from Muslim clerics, one of whom offered a bounty equivalent to $10,000 to anybody killing the writer, was an interview she supposedly gave in May to The Statesman, a Calcutta newspaper. In the interview, she was reported to have said that ""the Koran should be thoroughly revised."" Miss Nasrin issued a statement denying the remark, but her clarification, saying that ""we have to move beyond these ancient texts if we want progress,"" deepened the controversy. An Outspoken Critic Miss Nasrin's newspaper columns, poems and novels in recent years have established her as an outspoken critic of Islamic traditions she represented as restricting women's rights. Three times married, she has been a bold advocate of sexual freedom, especially in a series of graphic poems, and in interviews in which she suggested that Muslim women should have the right to have four husbands, equal to the number of wives permitted to Muslim men under the Koran. She also angered many in Bangladesh with a 1993 novel, ""Shame,"" in which she depicted Bangladesh's Hindu minority as having been picked out for revenge by Muslims after the incident in December 1992 in which a Hindu mob destroyed an ancient mosque in Ayodhya, northern India. Weeks of Violence The incident set off weeks of mob violence between Hindus and Muslims in India and a series of less violent clashes in Bangladesh. The novel was banned after selling 60,000 copies in Bangladesh, and Miss Nasrin had her passport withdrawn for several months. Rallies against Miss Nasrin have taken place in Dhaka and other major cities across this nation of 120 million people. A general strike caused chaos in Dhaka and resulted in clashes in which one man was killed and more than 200 other people were injured. Muslim fundamentalist groups have used the campaign to renew demands for the expulsion from Bangladesh of foreign aid organizations that disburse much of the $2 billion in annual development assistance. They say that these groups, by pressing for female education, birth control and wider women's rights, are undermining Muslim mores. Boycott of Parliament The turmoil has coincided with a five-month political impasse created by an opposition boycott of Parliament. The boycott has weakened the authority of the Government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and raised doubts about its ability to survive until elections scheduled to be held by February 1996. One of the boycotting parties is a Muslim fundamentalist group, Jamaat-e-Islami. Critics of the Government's move against Miss Nasrin say that it was aimed at placating the Jamaat leaders and drawing them back into Parliament. Criticism From Middle Class But even among the Westernized middle class, which has long feared Muslim fundamentalists, Miss Nasrin has been criticized for giving militants an opportunity to foment passions among the population. ""I don't think for a moment that she set out to create a situation like this, but what she has said has given a handle to people who have not hesitated to use it for mischievous purposes,"" said Kamal Hossain, an Oxford-educated lawyer and former Foreign Minister who has been one of Miss Nasrin's lawyers.  Rushdie Rallies Support BONN, July 12 (Reuters) -- Salman Rushdie is leading a group of prominent writers rallying support for the Bangladeshi feminist writer, Taslima Nasrin, Berlin's Tageszeitung newspaper said today. Mr. Rushdie, who has been in hiding since Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a death sentence against him in 1989 for blasphemy, will publish an open letter to Ms. Nasrin in the newspaper and 20 others across Europe Wednesday.",1994,"Bangladesh"
"72","Free Taslima Nasrin","Asia","I am writing in response to the Dec. 11 news story on Taslima Nasrin, the Bangladeshi feminist writer under death threat from radical Muslim groups. I correspond regularly by fax with Ms. Nasrin. It is almost a year since the government of Bangladesh seized Ms. Nasrin's passport. Recently, 5,000 supporters of the Council of Soldiers of Islam marched through the nation's capital demanding her arrest and execution, as well as the banning of all her books, yet she cannot leave the country. As The Post's article pointed out, Ms. Nasrin exposed ill treatment of Hindus in her banned novel ""Laija"" (""Shame"") and called in her newspaper columns for prosecution of the Muslim clerics whose illegal religious courts have condemned poor women to death by stoning or burning. Government leaders deny that there is any threat to Ms. Nasrin's life. Clearly, they fear that knowledge of her plight may affect the world's opinion of democracy in Bangladesh and have an impact on foreign aid. For months, International PEN and Amnesty International have been trying to persuade the government of Bangladesh to restore Ms. Nasrin's freedom to travel, prosecute those who threaten her death and stop censoring her work. We have not gotten far. Like most censorship, this has backfired and created more demand for Ms. Nasrin's work. To satisfy this demand and help us better understand women's lives and literature in South Asia, my committee has invited Ms. Nasrin to speak in the United States this spring. But we cannot even get an answer from her government to the question of when her passport will be restored. John Shattuck, assistant secretary of State for human rights, said in testimony before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee Sept. 29: ""The elimination of abuses and discrimination against women will be an important factor in our overall consideration of the human rights records of countries interested in receiving U.S. aid and trade benefits."" No one wants to penalize the poor of Bangladesh for their government's failure to protect women's human rights. But if the Bangladeshi government will not restore Ms. Nasrin's passport, human rights activists in the United States are bound to remind Mr. Shattuck of these words.

"73","Filipino Migrant Workers Find a Harsh World","Asia","To the Editor: On March 17 Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino maid from Laguna, was hanged in Singapore on murder charges despite evidence from witnesses who claim she was innocent (news articles, March 17 and 18). Her execution has become the rallying point of nationalistic rhetoric on the violent treatment of Filipino women migrant workers in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Britain -- in short, all over the world. Most of the people who have written in the Manila newspapers appropriating Flor Contemplacion's execution are the elite. Most of these same Filipino elite treat their own women servants like animals and actually call them ""hayup"" (the Tagalog word for ""animal""). I know too well the plight of Filipino women migrant workers abroad. I was born in Laguna, but grew up in Pangasinan, one of the poorest provinces in the Philippines with one of the highest rates of workers going abroad. I have an army of aunts, uncles and former neighbors who work as domestic servants in Abu Dhabi, the Netherlands, Britain and Japan, who send me letters about their humiliating experiences, of not being treated as human beings. Like Flor, most of these aunts do not see their children and families for years, some as long as 10 years. Many have stories about being raped by their bosses, about escaping horrible working conditions by jumping from the third floor of a tall building, about organizing a trade union in Saudi Arabia and being arrested, imprisoned and sent home without pay. I would be as expendable, a poor woman from some obscure village in a marginal former colony, if I had not been privileged to receive scholarships to study for a Ph.D. It is easy to rouse anger about foreign injustice when it is done in a police state like Singapore. Almost anyone could be outraged. But it is much more difficult to talk about what is being erased -- the question of class. This is part of a pattern woven into a fabric of exploitative labor and daily humiliation. The ruling elite all over Southeast Asia, regardless of nationality or race, collaborate and use the same tactics to make poor people shut up. This is really what the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Asia Pacific Economic Conference ""solidarity"" is all about. They turn dead women workers into martyrs and national heroines, then everyone will shut up. Then they can say that these women did not die in vain. Meanwhile, women languish in prisons with no right to a fair trial and are executed for someone else's crimes. The rhetoric of nationalism, which works best by obscuring class and gender, is inadequate to explain the complexities of the exploitation of female labor and the expansion of international capital in Southeast Asia. Poor women like Flor Contemplacion do not matter. Business goes on as usual. JACQUELINE SIAPNO Irvine, Calif., March 21, 1995",1995,"Philippines"

A companion ten-day forum begins Aug. 30. ""They said they want it peaceful,"" Mr. Tong said late Wednesday. Mr. Tong had appealed this week to the United Nations to protect him against Chinese efforts to prevent him from attending forum meetings on women forced by the Japanese army into prostitution for its soldiers during World War II. The Chinese Government gave up any claims to war reparations when it established diplomatic relations with Japan in 1972. Also today, in Wuhan in central China, the Chinese Government allowed a United States diplomat to visit the Chinese-American human rights activist, Harry Wu, who was detained June 19 and formally charged last month with spying.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto vowed to do away with laws that discriminate against women, yet women face cruel punishment under laws that discriminate against them.

"76","Ex-Policeman's Jail Term Hailed by Women in India","Asia","The conviction of India's best-known police officer last week for slapping a woman's backside at a party eight years ago, and his sentencing -- to three months in jail and a $20 fine -- have been hailed by women's groups as a landmark in the struggle for women's rights. The trial, which ended last Tuesday, was front-page news across India because of the prominence of the defendant, K. P. S. Gill, who had retired at the end of last year as director general of the police in Punjab State. Mr. Gill, 61, earned renown, and controversy, for the harsh tactics he employed against a decade-long separatist insurgency, which was suppressed in 1993 after the loss of more than 10,000 lives. The defeat of the Sikh separatists and the subsequent return to prosperity in Punjab, with a population of more than 20 million, earned Mr. Gill the sobriquet of ""super cop"" from India's popular press. But human-rights organizations here and abroad, as well as families of slain Sikh militants, have continued to demand action against Mr. Gill for his involvement in a well-chronicled campaign of police brutality that is said to have included the torture and summary killing of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Sikh separatists and members of their families. Because the Indian Government is considered unlikely to heed the demands for action against Mr. Gill for his actions during the insurgency, which posed one of the most serious threats to India's stability since independence nearly 50 years ago, his conviction under a section of the criminal code for ""outraging the modesty"" of the woman at the party has been welcomed by some in Punjab as a small measure of justice. Others, including commentators in several of the country's major newspapers, have described the conviction, or at least the jail sentence, as poor reward to Mr. Gill for ridding India of a major separatist threat. But the loudest resonance of the case has been among women's groups, which have long campaigned for action by the Government and the courts to combat the widespread abuses that are the lot of Indian women. According to those groups, few countries have a higher incidence of rape and sexual harassment than India, and a lower incidence of successful prosecutions. Dowry killings, in which brides are murdered for refusing demands from husbands and in-laws for money and gifts, are also common, and rarely punished. The case against Mr. Gill was rooted in events at a party in 1988. According to evidence presented in court at Chandigarh, the Punjab capital, Mr. Gill approached Rupan Deol Bajaj, a senior official in the state government, and asked her to follow him to an adjoining room. When Mrs. Bajaj refused, the prosecution in the case said, Mr. Gill became angry and slapped Mrs. Bajaj on the backside. Mrs. Bajaj testified that the incident followed an earlier attempt by Mr. Gill to pull her chair closer to his, and that Mr. Gill, who has often spoken of his fondness for whisky, appeared to have had too much to drink. Mr. Gill denied having touched Mrs. Bajaj, and said the friction between them at the party resulted from his having refused to intervene on behalf of Mrs. Bajaj and her husband, also a senior government official, in an unrelated police investigation. He has announced his intention to appeal the conviction, which carried with it the magistrate's stipulation that Mr. Gill be subjected to what is known in India as ""rigorous imprisonment,"" a harsh regimen generally reserved for serious criminals. Appeals in Indian courts often drag on for many years. A feature of the case that has drawn widespread comment in India is the time that it took for the case to come to trial, and the prosecution's allegations of an attempted cover-up by senior officials who were said to have closed ranks around Mr. Gill.  When Mrs. Bajaj and her husband pressed charges, lower courts dismissed them, determining there was no case to answer. But the couple pursued the matter to the Indian Supreme Court, which ordered the charges reinstated last year. A further delay ensued when Mr. Gill, who is president of the Indian Hockey Federation, traveled to the United States last month, where he attended the Olympic Games in Atlanta and watched the Indian field hockey team in its unsuccessful bid to win a medal. Mrs. Bajaj, 48, called the ruling a victory for Indian women. ""The judgment of a man who outraged the modesty of a woman sends the positive message that there is hope yet for women who dare to seek justice,"" she said. ""Thousands of young women who are every day faced with situations similar to mine, or worse, will now have the courage to come out and speak."" But Mr. Gill's backers were insistent that an injustice had been done. Most commentaries in Indian newspapers took the view that even if Mr. Gill had slapped Mrs. Bajaj, the proper punishment would have been a fine or an official reprimand.",1996,"India"
"77","Japan Pays Some Women From War Brothels, but Many Refuse","Asia","With Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto expressing his ""sincere apologies and remorse,"" Japan made its first payments today from a private fund to compensate Asian women who were forced into army brothels during World War II. However, only a handful of the women are accepting the payments.  Many others object that using private money rather than Government funds allows Japan to evade responsibility for running the brothels, which forcibly employed as many as 200,000 women, many of them teen-agers, from many Asian nations. The initial payments of two million yen, or almost $19,000 each, were made to only 4 of the 107 former sex slaves in the Philippines today, one day before the 51st anniversary of Japan's surrender in the war. ""We finally got justice after more than 50 years,"" one of the women, Rufina Fernandez, 69, said at a brief ceremony at a Manila hotel, according to the Kyodo News Service. The payments were accompanied by a letter from Mr. Hashimoto saying that Japan is ""painfully aware of its moral responsibility"" in the affair. ""As Prime Minister of Japan, I thus extend anew my most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences and suffered incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women,"" he wrote, using Japan's term for the women. The Prime Minister's apology is similar to others issued since 1992, when the Government began acknowledging -- if only grudgingly and only when confronted with overwhelming evidence -- the role of the military authorities in coercing young women to have sex with as many as 20 or more soldiers a day. Still, up until recently it was uncertain whether Mr. Hashimoto, who has nationalistic views regarding Japan's role in the war, would apologize. His reluctance forced the most prominent backer of the fund, the widow of a former Prime Minister, to resign in protest this spring. By issuing his letter today, Mr. Hashimoto thus probably averted opening a new wound in Japan's relations with its Asian neighbors. But some critics still attacked the apology as not being strong enough. ""He does not recognize the nation's legal responsibility,"" only its moral responsibility, said Yoshiaki Yoshimi, a historian at Chuo University who unearthed much of the proof that the Government, not private enterprise, established the brothels. He said Mr. Hashimoto also used a less formal Japanese word for ""apology"" than he might have. Even an official of the fund said the statement was not ideal. ""What the comfort women want Japan's society and Government to do is recognize that they were forcibly taken to work in the brothels, and in that regard the wording is very vague,"" said the official, Katsumi Taga. Japan has refused to make direct Government payments because it is afraid claims will pour in from all sorts of victims of its wartime atrocities. Japan maintains that it settled all its legal obligations in agreements it reached with other nations after the war. So the Government last year created a nominally private Asian Women's Fund to solicit donations and make payments. But that solution, too, is in danger of falling apart. Partly because of the opposition from the women, the fund has raised only about $4 million, far less than the initial goal of $10 million to $20 million and not enough for even the planned first-round payments to 300 women in South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines. Women in South Korea and Taiwan are refusing the payments and only seven women in the Philippines have applied, according to Mr. Taga.",1996,"Japan"
"78","Maria Rosa Henson, 69, Dies; Victim of Japanese Brothels","Asia","Maria Rosa Henson, the first of a growing number of Philippine women to break a long silence and announce that she had been systematically raped by Japanese soldiers during World War II, has died at age 69. Her family said she died of a heart attack last week in the small home she had built in Manila using part of a $19,000 settlement she received from a specially created Japanese fund a year ago. Mrs. Henson, who married after the war and supported a family as a worker at a cigarette factory, embarked in her 60's on a new life as a symbolic representative of as many as 200,000 women who had been forced to work in Japanese Army brothels. In recent years, since Mrs. Henson's announcement in 1992, the issue has drawn wide attention, and victims have banded together to protest in the Philippines and Korea. Last year Mrs. Henson published a stark account of her ordeal titled ""Comfort Woman: Slave of Destiny"" (Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism). A film about her life is being prepared in the Philippines.  She had planned to travel to Vienna next March to speak about her experiences and to open an exhibit of autobiographical drawings. Mrs. Henson was also the lead plaintiff in a class action suit against the Japanese Government seeking damages for forced prostitution, and shortly before she died she was interviewed by a team of lawyers visiting from Tokyo. In an interview last November, Mrs. Henson said she had fought against her trauma by clinging to the memory of every detail of her abuse, which began when she was 15 and lasted for nine months. ""I learned to remember everything, to remember always, so that I will not go mad,"" she said. ""I am telling my story so that they will feel humiliated,"" she said of her tormentors. ""It is true: I am an avenger of the dead."" Since Mrs. Henson stepped forward to reveal what she had felt was a shameful secret about her past, 168 other women in the Philippines have followed her lead. But her acceptance last year of compensation prompted controversy because it came from the Asian Women's Fund -- a private fund organized by the Japanese Government -- rather than from the Government itself. Some local women's groups opposed this form of compensation, calling it an attempt by the Japanese Government to shirk official responsibility and to avoid opening the door to lawsuits from other war victims. Along with her compensation from the private fund, Mrs. Henson received a letter of apology from the Japanese Government. She then became the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit. But her strongest indictment came in her book, a blunt and graphic account, which she wrote in longhand on sheets of lined paper and which has been published in the Philippines and Japan. ""As I was writing, I was crying,"" Mrs. Henson said in the interview. In her account of her daily routine, she said soldiers had lined up outside a small building to wait their turns with one of a half dozen imprisoned women or teen-age girls. ""My work began, and I lay down as one by one the soldiers raped me,"" Mrs. Henson wrote. ""Every day, anywhere from 12 to over 20 soldiers assaulted me. There were times when there were as many as 30. They came to the garrison in truckloads. ""I lay on the bed with my knees up and my feet on the mat, as if I were giving birth. Whenever the soldiers did not feel satisfied they vented their anger on me. When the soldiers raped me, I felt like a pig. I was angry all the time."" Mrs. Henson is survived by a son and a daughter as well as by several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",1997,"Philippines"
"79","Japan Court Backs 3 Brothel Victims","Asia","Bluntly condemning Japanese policy, a court ruled today that the Government must compensate three South Korean women forced to work in brothels for Japanese soldiers during World War II. The ruling, the first in a lawsuit by former brothel victims, awarded the women the equivalent of $2,300 each. It was likely to have a profound effect on five pending cases and could encourage others to file similar lawsuits. Japan's Government has refused to compensate individual war victims, contending that postwar treaties settled all wartime claims. In his surprisingly sharp ruling, a Yamaguchi District Court Judge, Hideaki Chikashita, called the army's actions an example of sexual and ethnic discrimination and a ""fundamental violation of human rights."" Historians say as many as 200,000 women from Asia and elsewhere were taken to front-line brothels to serve Japanese soldiers.",1998,"Japan"
"80","Beijing Students and Women, Defying Ban, Protest Anti-Chinese Violence in Indonesia","Asia","Defying a ban by Government officials, students and women's groups held emotional protests today over the looting, killing and rape directed against ethnic Chinese during riots in Indonesia in May. The rioting in Indonesia originally received only cursory media coverage in China. It was not until this month, when two Chinese newspapers published photo essays showing the violence, that the issue was thrust before the Chinese public. Those reports have prompted anger directed primarily at Indonesia's leaders. But China's Government and its official press have also been criticized by some citizens who say they should have reacted sooner and more strongly. Both a women's group and students from Beijing University had applied to the Public Security Bureau for permission to hold organized demonstrations today, Indonesian Independence Day, and were turned down. But individuals from both groups went ahead with smaller events that had a powerful impact, contending they were not organized demonstrations. It was an unusual move in a city where political demonstrations are tightly controlled, reflecting people's greater willingness recently to speak out and the Goverment's slightly greater tolerance of it. Thought tiny, the student political protests were the largest since the pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 in Tiananmen Square. At a hotel banquet room here decorated with feminist slogans and pictures of women who had been reported raped and tortured, 100 people attended a protest meeting, where a number of prominent women gave often tearful speeches. ""More than 10,000 demonstrated in Hong Kong -- more than 10,000 signatures were collected in New York,"" Zhao Shuqing, a television reporter who wore a yellow ribbon in support of the ethnic Chinese Indonesians, said at the meeting. ""And I wondered, what has mainland China done in this matter?"" At the Indonesian Embassy in Beijing's trendy Sanlitun district today, small groups of university students, also wearing yellow ribbons, arrived throughout the morning to protest the abuse, each in its own way. A group of several dozen from Beijing University staged a short sit-in outside the Ambassador's residence and presented a T-shirt signed by more than 100 students protesting the atrocities. Others unfurled posters bearing grisly photographs that have appeared in the Chinese press. ""We came spontaneously,"" said a young man who would identify himself only by his surname, Xiong, and who said he is an undergraduate at Beijing University. ""This was not organized. It was a matter of conscience."" Security was heavy, with far more police officers than students lining the street outside the embassy. Human rights groups have said 1,200 people were killed and 150 women raped in the riots in Jakarta. The ethnic violence in Indonesia, presents a quandary to Chinese officials. China's longtime policy has been not to meddle in the affairs of other countries and not to tolerate other countries' meddling in its affairs, particularly when human rights is involved. Still, as China has grown as a regional power, it has begun to shed its traditional isolationism. With world outrage growing over the reports of abuse of the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, Beijing started in mid-July to lodge protests, which have grown louder over time. Although both the women's group and the students had to sidestep the authorities somewhat to get their message out, they also received some support from the Government.  Officials passed on a student petition protesting the violence to the Indonesian Government, for instance. After women from the China Women's News were denied permission to demonstrate, some of them reserved a banquet room in the Qi Lu Hotel, where the women used words rarely uttered in China. ""The Chinese media didn't act quickly enough when the riots broke out,"" Zhang Kangkang, a well-known author, said at the meeting. ""There are no human rights under a dictatorial government,"" she said later. ""This is a point we must realize."" The students also ultimately had their say. On Saturday, a huge poster appeared on the Beijing University campus with a letter of protest addressed to the Indonesian Ambassador in Beijing. It quickly gathered 1,500 signatures. University officials were instructed not to permit demonstrations to leave campus. But today students slipped out from Beijing University and Qinghua University in dribs and drabs and made their way to the Indonesian Embassy for their protests. The hundreds of police officers generally allowed the students to briefly make their point, then politely urged them to go home.",1998,"China"
"81","In Jakarta, Reports Of Numerous Rapes Of Chinese in Riots","Asia","In addition to the looting and arson that was largely aimed at Chinese neighborhoods in three days of rioting in Jakarta last month, human rights and women's aid groups have begun to document what they say appears to have been an organized campaign of assaults, gang rapes and killings of ethnic Chinese women. The aid workers say they have talked with dozens of victims or relatives of victims and they estimated today that more than 100 women and girls may have been attacked and raped in Jakarta alone as their neighborhoods were burning between May 13 and 15. There were reports of similar attacks during riots in other cities that preceded the fall of President Suharto on May 21. One worker at a women's aid center, Sita Kayam, said she believed that hundreds of women were receiving physical or psychological help at hospitals here. Other aid workers said most of the victims remained too traumatized to talk about their experiences and too terrified of reprisals to report their ordeals to officials or even to unofficial rape centers. The police said no reports of rape had been brought to the authorities. Another worker at the women's aid center, Ita F. Nadia, said some women had committed suicide after their ordeals. The reported attacks ranged from the degrading and humiliating to the horrific; from women who were made to strip and perform calisthenics in public to women who were repeatedly raped and then thrown into the flames of burning buildings. The reports involve girls and women ranging in age from 10 to 55, the aid workers said. Some were gang-raped in front of a crowd in the Chinese commercial district of Glodok, said Rita Kolibonso, executive director of the women's group Mitra Perempuan. ""Some of the rapists said, 'You must be raped because you are Chinese and non-Muslim,' "" said Ms. Ita, who works at a crisis center called Kalyana Mitra. Ethnic Chinese citizens, who control much of the country's commerce, have been targets of violence in Indonesia for years. The consensus among human rights workers and rape counselors is that the attacks were mostly organized by unknown groups, in the same way that increasing evidence suggests that organized groups were involved in instigating attacks of arson and vandalism. This evidence is based on reports that groups of men arrived simultaneously at various targets in the city with gasoline bombs and other weapons and initiated the violence. Albert Hasibuan, a member of the National Commission on Human Rights, said human rights workers had talked with a participant in the riots who said he had been recruited, briefed, paid and transported by unidentified men, who provided him and others with stones and gasoline bombs. The commission is the official Government human-rights monitoring agency, but since its formation in 1996 it has often been critical of the Government. Because of the organized nature of many of the reported assaults and because of some physical descriptions of the attackers, the aid workers said they suspected that some elements of the armed forces might have been involved. Some witnesses said they observed men with muscular builds and military haircuts, and one victim she was raped by men who had a military uniform in their car. Human rights groups have reported similar suspicions about reported instigators of the looting and arson, who traveled in groups through the city in vehicles. Mr. Hasibuan's group reported last week that at least 1,188 people had died in the rioting in Jakarta and that 40 large shopping centers, 4,083 shops and 1,026 private homes had been attacked, burned or looted. Lieut. Col. Iman Haryatna, the Central Jakarta police chief, told reporters that victims were welcome to come forward but that the police had so far received no reports of assaults on women during the riots. Because of a widespread mistrust of security forces both among the victims and human rights workers, the reports of rapes are being gathered instead by two prominent women's crisis centers and three well-established human rights groups. Two aid workers said they had received telephone threats warning them to stop their investigations and their aid to victims. One, a Catholic priest named Father Sandiyawan who works at the private Jakarta Social Institute, said someone had sent him a hand grenade in the mail as a warning. The other said she received a telephone call on Saturday in which a man said: ""Do you know that a week ago we sent a grenade to Father Sandiyawan? Do you want more than the grenade we sent to Father Sandiyawan?"" ""It is really a part of the system of the authoritarian regime that wants to build a culture of fear and intimidate society through women,"" said Ms. Ita. She said she had documented similar attacks on women in the provinces of East Timor and Aceh, where the military is battling separatist insurgencies, and even in situations elsewhere where the Government was attempting to appropriate land from villagers. ""So now the regime will say to society, 'Look, if you want democracy and reform this is the cost you will have to pay,' "" she said. ""So it is part of the intimidation of the people."" Three weeks after the riots, Ms. Ita said, it is still very difficult to approach the victims of rapes and harassment ""because their trauma is very deep."" ""Even for myself, I will tell you that it is really emotionally difficult because I have to confront the experiences of the victims,"" she said. ""It is really very, very bad."" Slowly and painfully, she and other counselors have compiled accounts like these: * A student was abducted at a bus stop, taken to a swamp near the airport and raped by four men in a car. There was a green uniform in the car and she asked her abductors if they were police officers. ""If you are police, you have to save me,"" she told them, according to Ms. Ita. One of them answered: ""No, I have to give you a lesson. You are a woman and you are beautiful and you are part of the Chinese."" * In the midst of the riot, a group of men stopped a city bus and forced out all the non-Chinese women. ""Then they chose the beautiful women among the Chinese and raped them inside the bus,"" Father Sandiyawan said. ""The victims of that incident are really depressive. They are in the hospital with their families. They are trying to hide themselves from the public."" * A 10-year-old girl returning from school discovered that the shop-house where her family lived and worked had been burned. As she went in search of her parents, she was seized by two men and raped in front of her neighbors. * One woman, a bank officer, told a local reporter that she was seized from the back of a motorcycle in the middle of the riot and thrown to the ground by a group of men. ""She told me she was so hysterical and she was so panicked that she does not remember what happened,"" the reporter said. ""But she showed me a lot of bruises on her body, especially on her legs."" * In an incident of public humiliation, a group of about 15 men entered a bank where 10 ethnic Chinese employees were taking refuge from the riot. The men locked the door, made the women take off their clothes and ordered them to dance. In a similar incident during a riot in the city of Medan on May 4, 20 female students at a teachers' training college were stopped by police officers when they tried to flee the violence on their campus. The officers forced them to take off their clothes and perform calisthenics. In both cases, the women reported that they were fondled but not raped. In another incident of harassment during the riot in Jakarta, a number of ethnic Chinese women were reportedly stripped and made to swim in a pond. Ms. Ita told of an ethnic Chinese woman who hid in her house with her two younger sisters as the rioters approached. About 10 men came into the house and found the sisters on the third floor. They made the two younger women take off their clothes and told the older sister to stand in a corner, ""because you are too old for us."" Meanwhile, arsonists entered the lower floors and set fire to the building. ""After they had raped her two sisters, the two men said to her, 'We are finished and we are satisfied and because you are too old and ugly we weren't interested in you.' So they took her two sisters and pushed them to the ground floor where there was already fire, and they were killed. ""When her mother heard the news, she had a heart attack and died,"" Ms. Ita said. ""So now this woman is in a psychiatric hospital. Sometimes she cries when she tells the story and sometimes she is normal again. That is one of the stories we have confirmed.""",1998,"Indonesia"

"83","THE WORLD: Violation; An Old Scourge of War Becomes Its Latest Crime","Asia","THEY strike without warning, bringing terror to an apartment in Algeria, a Chinese shop in Indonesia, a squalid refugee encampment in Africa or a Balkan farming village under siege. They are shadowy men with causes so blinding and hatreds so deep that they have transformed modern warfare into orgies of primordial savagery -- raping, brutalizing, humiliating, slashing and hacking women and girls to death. More civilians than soldiers are being maimed and killed in the wars of nationalism and ethnicity that are the hallmark of the century's end, wars fought in neighborhoods rather than battlefields. More to the point, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the new style of warfare is often aimed specifically at women and is defined by a view of premeditated, organized sexual assault as a tactic in terrorizing and humiliating a civilian population. In some cases the violators express a motive that seems to have more in common with the tactics of ancient marauding hordes than with the 20th century -- achieving forced pregnancy and thus poisoning the womb of the enemy. From Bosnia to Indonesia International attention first focused on the use of rape as a tactic of warfare in Bosnia, where a United Nations commission and human rights groups found that ethnic Serb paramilitary groups had systematically tolerated or encouraged the raping of Bosnian Muslim women as part of the effort to drive Muslims from their homes and villages between 1991 and 1995. Rape was also employed by Hutu troops against Tutsi women in the genocidal campaign Hutu leaders conducted in Rwanda in 1994. Last year, women who have identified with secular culture in Algeria accused desperate rebels fighting in the name of Islamic revolution of kidnapping them and making them sex slaves. In Indonesia, reports are surfacing that suggest members of the security forces may have been among the men who raped ethnic Chinese women during rioting last month. And in the Balkans, Serbs are again emptying towns of a rival ethnic group -- this time Albanians in Kosovo -- and human rights and women's groups are monitoring the growing violence for the possibility that rape will again be one of the techniques. None of this is the essentially random rape that traditionally follows conquest, intolerable though that is; it is different even from forcing conquered women to be prostitutes for the victors, as Japan did in Korea during World War II. The difference is that in all four recent cases, sexual degradation and intimidation -- often public -- seem to have been used as a strategy of ethnic or religious conflict itself. This use of rape as a premeditated act of warfare is challenging anew the efforts by nations of the world to organize effectively to prevent and punish crimes against humanity, a monumental task that moves into new territory tomorrow with the opening of a treaty conference in Rome to create the world's first international criminal court. Largely because of the systematic use of sexual assault in ethnic wars in the Balkans and Rwanda, the court is expected to rank rape as an internationally recognized war crime for the first time in history, alongside violence against noncombatants, mistreatment of prisoners, torture and other unusual punishments. The Rape Camps Widney Brown, an advocate with the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch, echoed other experts when she said that rape ""has probably been an issue in every major conflict, but what happened in Bosnia, particularly with the creation of the rape camps, really brought it to light."" In the Balkans, where soldiers of every faction were accused of rape, the discovery of areas where Serbian soldiers confined Bosnian Muslim women to be raped shocked many. ""In Yugoslavia rape was a part of ethnic cleansing, because the message that you got was if you stayed, the men would be murdered and the women would be raped,"" Ms. Brown said. ""That was followed very quickly by what happened in Rwanda, where we have similar widespread allegations of rape and mutilation,"" she added. ""In fact, part of the preliminary campaign that created the atmosphere that allowed the genocide to happen was the demonization of Tutsi women as oversexualized creatures who were seductresses. It's not surprising that during the conflict they were subjected to rape, and a lot of sexual mutilation. Mutilation is another way of saying, 'We don't perceive of this person as a human being.' "" For about five years now, ad hoc tribunals have been hearing allegations of war crimes, first in the Balkans and later in Rwanda, and these tribunals have already decided to consider rape a war crime in those conflicts. Since they have been serving as small-scale models for the permanent international court that is just being formed, that court is expected to follow suit. ""These tribunals were literally forced to pay attention to a series of petitions and pressures from women's organizations demanding that rape be recognized,"" said Felice Gaer, an expert on human rights and international organizations for the American Jewish Committee. Ms. Gaer said that ultimately the support of Justice Richard Goldstone, the first war crimes prosecutor for the Balkans and Rwanda, succeeded in elevating sex crimes to the level of genocide and crimes against humanity. This was the first step taken by nations trying to tackle collectively this new scourge of war. But women are drawing up a longer list of gender-related crimes in wartime, and promise a battle to have them recognized by the International Criminal Court. Ken Franzblau, who tracks the sexual exploitation of women for Equality Now, a New York-based organization that aids women in poor nations and immigrant women here, said rape is so widespread now because it is so effective in ethnic wars. ""It has such devastating effects on communities, particularly in traditional societies or very religious communities where the virginity and the fidelity of women can be central to the makeup of that society,"" he said. Rape is a psychological grenade thrown into the middle of daily life to provoke maximum terror. ""That's why you see a fair number of these rapes committed in front of family members of the girls or women involved,"" he said. Some analysts believe that the fast pace of international communications today may be a factor in the rapid recurrence of the use of rape as a tactic of war in such widely separate parts of the world. But if that is true, it is also evident that rapid international communication has played a role in stirring international outrage about the tactic. Over the last decade, there have been significant changes among the vulnerable women themselves. Women who were the victims of sexual abuse in the name of ethnic purity, nationalism and sometimes religious zeal have begun to speak out, often aided by human rights organizations and women's crisis centers. For many, this has been a revolutionary change. Beyond Suicide ""Lots of women just committed suicide in the past,"" said Charlotte Bunch executive director of the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers. ""That's one very clear thing that's beginning to emerge now. In this decade, the outrage that women have been able to raise about the issue means that people are reporting it. But the truth is that there is also a backlash about women speaking out. There may be some moments before we reach a point where there is enough outrage to get the phenomenon under control."" The phenomenon takes human form in a number of recent accounts reported by journalists. Take the story of Nawal Fathi, who was captured by militants in Algeria in 1996, made into a sex slave and raped by a score of men before being rescued by government troops. A psychiatrist who treated her said that despite a year of medical treatment, Ms. Fathi committed suicide at the age of 24 last year. In Jakarta, aid workers were quoted last week as saying that hundreds of ethnic Chinese women had been sexually assaulted during the looting of Chinese neighborhoods, apparently by organized gangs that may have had links to security forces. ""Some of the attackers said, 'You must be raped because you are Chinese and non-Muslim,' "" one woman recalled. Again, a number of women have killed themselves rather than live in shame. Outside Religion Although militants in Algeria and roving gangs of rapists in Indonesia are Muslims, the phenomenon is probably not related to religion, though radical religious views may provide justification to an elemental misogyny. The Taliban movement in Afghanistan, for example, has repressed women but its holy warriors have not abused them sexually, as their predecessors in the Mujahedeen armies were frequently accused of doing, Afghan women say. Roman Catholics butchered other Roman Catholics in Rwanda and Burundi. Sex slaves are also a hallmark of the vaguely evangelical Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. Burmese troops in Myanmar, a Buddhist country, are accused in a new report from the human-rights group Earthrights of using rape as a weapon against women from 20 or more ethnic minorities or student groups that oppose the military regime. Because women displaced by ethnic warfare or other forms of mass violence are often not safe even in refugee camps -- or arrive there pregnant through rape -- United Nations relief agencies and some private groups have begun to offer gynecological services and the ""morning after"" pill, which prevents conception. Although this practice has been sharply criticized by anti-abortion groups in the United States, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, and others have continued to provide help to abused women. At Equality Now, Mr. Franzblau said the kind of sexual abuse that took place in Bosnia, where Serb rapes of Muslim women were numerous and intense personal hatred was directed at neighbors, not some distant stranger at an enemy gun emplacement, makes the impact much worse and stokes the fires for the next round of strife. ""That's why it is going to be very difficult to reconcile these communities,"" he said. ""How can you move families back to homes where a mother or daughter or sister was raped by a next-door neighbor?""",1998,"Indonesia"
"84","Two Deaths Spur Probe of Japan's Telephone Dating Clubs","Asia","Japan's wildly popular telephone dating clubs are coming under new scrutiny today following the deaths of two women who were drugged, robbed and abandoned in the subfreezing winter cold by a man they met on the phone. The killings are the latest in a sharply increasing wave of crime arising from telekura, as the clubs are known here. Police say the clubs are hotbeds of prostitution, drug trade and assaults committed on people, mainly young women, who agree to meet strange men. Police say that more than 1,000 crimes a year are related to telephone clubs. Most disturbing, police say, is the growing number of young people who are the victims and perpetrators of the crimes. Japan has been struggling for several years with the phenomenon known as ""enjo kosai,"" in which older men arrange dates with high school girls that often lead to paid sexual relations. Telephone clubs, which advertise with flyers and stickers in telephone booths all over Tokyo, are the most common method of arranging those dates. They are like an electronic bulletin board, where men and women sign up, leave a personal introduction and wait for others to listen to the message and call them. Crimes arising from telephone club dates also represent a dark side of Japan's obsession with technology. Dates are arranged on the cell phones and beepers that nearly every teenager in Japan carries. The Internet is also a popular means of arranging dates because young people enjoy the anonymity that computers and phones afford them. ""This incident can be seen as a manifestation of the sense of emptiness young people feel today,"" the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said in an editorial today. ""Noting that these young people have spent more time with those inanimate objects than with people, some scholars have pointed out that they may have developed a sense of 'loss of others.' "" Analysts here say that children raised on a steady diet of electronic gadgets, computer games, videos, the Internet and other electronic media find it harder to develop normal relationships with other people. They say children who are forced to interact more with others develop a healthier sense of how to make and keep friends -- and how to spot potential danger. While most of the young women and girls involved in telephone club sex generally have been treated as victims, police increasingly are treating them as criminals. Some have been charged with solicitation for prostitution. Often, the young women tell police that they wanted money to buy the expensive designer goods that are popular among Japan's trend-conscious youth. Police say Katsumi Hoshino, 23, arranged meetings on the phone with the two women who died, gave each strong sleeping pills to knock them out, then dumped them. One was found dead behind a kindergarten about a mile from her home; the other woman's body was discovered by her father in a parking lot. A third woman was drugged and robbed but was not harmed, and police say 10 or more other women have made complaints against Hoshino, an unemployed construction worker from a southern suburb of Tokyo. Police say Hoshino had no trouble luring his victims, who were mainly in their twenties. One woman told police that during a date with Hoshino arranged on the telephone, he gave her coffee that made her feel drowsy. When she woke up later, she noticed that about $ 40 was missing from her wallet. Another woman said Hoshino robbed her after giving her pills he said would improve the appearance of her skin. Police say they expect to charge Hoshino with murder because he allegedly left the two women who died in places with no shelter from the winter weather, where they were not likely to be found quickly.",1999,"Japan"
"85","Complaints Prompt Paper In Japan to Drop Racy Ads","Asia","For years, the ads have been a titillating, early week staple, anchoring the inside pages of the biggest newspaper in Japan with promises of photo layouts of nude women and scoops on the sex lives of the stars. But in a blow that it is claiming for women's rights, the paper, Yomiuri Shimbun, has decided to ban advertising for two of the raciest weekly magazines, saying they constitute and encourage sexual harassment. Newspaper officials said the decision, which means a weekly sacrifice of $600,000, had been prompted by complaints from employees and readers, as well as by the recent passage of a law on discrimination in the workplace. ""In the last few years, the content of these advertisements has become drastically more sexual, and voices have been raised both inside and outside our company about this matter,"" a spokesman for the paper, Tsuokazu Momoi, said. Although the full effects of the decision cannot be immediately determined, it is expected to increase pressure on other major dailies to revise ad policies for sexually explicit materials. Yomiuri Shimbun, the industry leader, has an audited daily circulation of 10.27 million. In an editorial on Tuesday about its decision, Yomiuri noted that 99 percent of its circulation was through home delivery. Allowing sexual material to be delivered to homes ""where it could possibly be seen by children cannot be called normal,"" the paper said. On Wednesday, another important daily, Mainichi Shimbun, said that it was considering revising policy. Asahi Shimbun, the most liberal major daily, said in a recent article that it had received many readers' complaints about the sexual content of ads and that revised standards would start this month. A debate among publishers about sexual material began last year after the Japan Bar Association took up the issue. Miki Tanikawa, the author of a paper that prompted the lawyers' group to discuss the issue, said in an interview that the ads reflected the low status of women in Japanese society. Yomiuri changed its ad policy at a time of substantial -- if glacial by the standards of much of the West -- progress on women's rights here. A landmark case was a harassment ruling in civil court last month in favor of a college student against the mayor of Osaka, the second largest city. The mayor was indicted on criminal charges and had to resign. A visit to a major company, including an interview at Yomiuri this week, involves being greeted at the reception desk by young women seemingly chosen for their charm and, inevitably, being served tea or coffee by other ever-smiling young women in a meeting room. At Yomiuri, the meeting room even had a rack of magazines, including the two whose ads have been banned, with young women on the covers and many nude pictures inside. In their breathless ads, complete with partly obscured pictures, the two weeklies, The Weekly Gendai and The Asahi Geino, commonly boast of ""displays of 16 ordinary women showing their pubic hair"" or ""first-time photos of former models with beautiful bosoms."" ""We have no intention of complaining about the fact that Yomiuri has its own standards,"" Asahi Geino wrote in statement. The magazine did, however, express surprise that Yomiuri's rules seemed to have suddenly changed. A statement from The Weekly Gendai called the decision ""truly incomprehensible."" Even though she hailed Yomiuri's decision, a leading feminist, Mizuho Fukushima, said she was surprised that the ban had been applied only to two weeklies, since many more offer a rich staple of nude women and sexually explicit cartoons. Ms. Fukushima added, however, that she regularly read the banned weeklies, as well as others with sexual material. That, she added, is because only the weeklies regularly have investigative reporting and muckraking. The large dailies, with close government and industry ties, seldom break ground in reporting. Sources in the newspaper industry partly explained the newspaper's target by saying Yomiuri has had a long-running battle with The Weekly Gendai, which has often attacked the paper, and criticized the baseball team it owns, the Yomiuri Giants. http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Japan"
"86","Malaysians Are Stunned by Reports Detailing Abuse of Servants","Asia","One young woman said she was kept in a cage by her employer. One was beaten with a heavy object that fractured her skull. One said she was poked with a stick in the gums and forced to beat herself on the thighs with a cane whenever she ""made a mistake."" Almost every day now in Malaysia, people are reading newspaper accounts of foreign domestic helpers who have been abused by their employers. The revelations of these secret crimes have horrified a society that sees itself as kind, hospitable and soft-spoken. People and societies reveal their true nature in the privacy of their homes, said Ivy Josiah, executive secretary of the Women's Aid Organization, a shelter for battered women and their children in Malaysia. ""The home is the most dangerous place, as far as I'm concerned, because it is private,"" she said. ""Incest, spousal abuse, maid abuse, it all happens in the home. Man by nature has to be given checks and balances. If there is no law outlawing domestic violence, it will carry on. We need to have laws in place to change social behavior."" Regarding abuse of domestic workers, she said, ""We need to widen the notion that maids, that poorer people who are working with you, also have rights. This is not slavery."" The issue came into the open when Ms. Josiah publicized the case of Nurjanah Maytak, one of thousands of poor Indonesians who have found work as domestic helpers in Malaysia, who said she had been poked in the gums and forced to cane herself. The nature of her punishments drew particular comment from people amazed at the seemingly endless human inventiveness in hurting other people. The publicity about Ms. Nurjanah, whose case is to be heard in mid-April, caused other abused domestic workers to come forward and set off a public round of soul searching. ""What sort of monster cages their domestics and denies them even the right to go to the toilet?"" asked Marina Mahathir, a leading social activist who is the daughter of the prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad. ""I shudder to think what this actually says about our society."" As Malaysia led the pack in the region's rapid development during the decade that preceded Asia's financial crisis in 1997, it imported as many as two million foreign workers -- perhaps half of them illegal -- to perform its hard labor. ""We are a nation that cannot even construct a building with our own hands any more,"" Sheryll Stothard, a Malaysian writer and social critic, wrote at the time. ""We have become a nation of subcontractors depending almost totally on foreign labor, money and expertise."" Two years ago, frightened by the prospect of a new wave of ""boat people"" fleeing poverty and violence in its huge neighbor, Indonesia, the Malaysian government instituted ""Operation Go Away,"" under which it summarily deported tens of thousands of foreign workers. That policy was soon forgotten, partly because of the objections of employers who rely -- like many in California and Texas -- on low-paid migrant labor, documented and undocumented. And as Malaysia prospered, foreign domestic helpers, mostly from Indonesia and the Philippines, became a common part of urban life. But with few legal protections, long hours, low pay and physical abuse also became common. ""There is this concept of, 'I have purchased you for 3,000 ringgit and therefore I can use you,' "" said Irene Fernandez, a prominent human rights activist in Malaysia. The sum is equal to about $800. ""The situation is not new,"" she said, ""but it is serious, and it's getting more serious. It demands immediate preventive action."" http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Malaysia"
"87","China Cracks Down on Abductions of Women, Kids","Asia","Chinese police and women's organizations have rescued more than 10,000 kidnapping victims in the past five weeks as part of a nationwide campaign to fight the alarming growth in abductions of women and children, an official newspaper reported. The tally means that since the campaign began on April 1, Chinese police and women's groups have saved more people than security organs did in all of 1999, when government statistics show 7,660 women and 1,814 children were rescued. The statistics demonstrate the rapid growth in such crimes as well as extra police efforts in connection with the campaign. In a related development, China's top court announced today that four human traffickers were executed for selling women and children to prostitution rings run by organized crime. That brings to eight the number of reported executions in the campaign so far. Abductions of women and children are skyrocketing in China, mainly because of a nationwide shortage of women and the desire of many farmers to have sons. Both problems originated from China's one-child policy, which often imposes fines and other punishments on couples who have more children than they are allowed. Another catalyst is a boom in prostitution. Chinese demographic experts estimate that there are 70 million more men than women in China, up from 1995, when that figure was estimated at 36 million. These days, in some regions of the country, men outnumber women two to one. This imbalance has been caused by Chinese couples using sonar technology to determine the sex of a fetus and aborting girls, by the killing of female babies and by deaths occurring because some families do not give girls equal access to medical care. Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, said recently that the abduction of women and children was ""running rampant"" and ""should be cracked down on with iron hands."" Speaking to the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, Bai Jingfu, vice minister of public security, said inadequate law enforcement and widening gaps between rich and poor are partly to blame. Since the crackdown began, state-run newspapers have published lurid accounts of abductions. One such case was that of 14-year-old Kang Minge, whose photograph appeared in the Beijing Youth Daily with a small article describing her ordeal. ""I had my first period when I was 11, I was a bride at 12 and had my son when I was 13,"" she told the newspaper. Kang was an orphan from the north-central province of Shaanxi and was sold to an old man in the northern province of Hebei. Another account concerned Pan Jinshan, an itinerant mine worker, who bought his wife for $ 436. His family managed to keep the woman hidden for more than a year in an isolated village in the impoverished southwestern province of Guangxi. When the woman failed to become pregnant, Pan told his father to also have sex with her to continue the family name. This continued until villagers tipped off police, who arrested father and son and rescued the woman. The China Daily said today that so far, more than 10,000 suspects have been arrested nationwide.",2000,"China"
"88","Fighting Sex Harassment, and Stigma, in Japan","Asia","For women all over this country, Moeko Tanaka, a former campaign worker who successfully sued the governor of this prefecture for sexually molesting her and won, remains a heroine without a face. By going to court in 1999, the 23-year-old university student did what few women in Japan have dared. And by publishing last month a detailed account of her ordeal, about how she was groped for 30 minutes, frozen with fear, in a van in the presence of several other campaign workers, and how she mustered the courage to do something about it, she did something rarer still. But for all her courage in confronting the governor of Japan's second-largest prefecture in court, what she still has not done in a society where male power and privilege have deep roots is reveal her identity. Though she gave a rare interview, Tanaka is her pen name, and she insisted that she be known by that only. Ms. Tanaka's triumph in court and her book, ""A Governor's Sexual Harassment, My Struggle,"" have been celebrated as victories by Japanese feminists. But behind her continuing need for anonymity lie the same fears that make thousands of other women suffer groping on crowded commuter trains, and other forms of sexual harassment and discrimination, in silence. And while the Japanese news media often give a high profile to incidents involving foreigners, like the abundant attention given in recent days to allegations by an Okinawan woman that she was raped by an American airman, molestation of women and sexual harassment generally receive little coverage. The story of Ms. Tanaka, who discussed her case in her lawyer's Osaka office, is filled with examples of the ostracism and loss that many Japanese women instinctively know awaits them if they protest their mistreatment too vigorously. Rather than an inspirational story of justice obtained, Ms. Tanaka's story will be read by many as a cautionary tale. When she complained afterward to the campaign workers who rode with her in the van where the Osaka prefectural governor, Knock Yokoyama, had placed a blanket over her legs, unzipped her pants and begun groping her, they told her to cheer up and not take it so hard. When she visited the neighbors who had helped her get the campaign job, they initially seemed supportive, but quickly cut off contact with her, and refused to testify at the trial. Her divorced mother, with whom she was living, begged her not to take the matter to court, telling her that her dream of becoming a social worker, or of ever getting a government job, would be destroyed forever. Her father warned her that she would become ""another Monica Lewinsky,"" and when she went ahead with her suit anyway, severed relations with her. Having endured all of this, and more still, such as separation from her boyfriend and the loss of many friends who questioned her decision to sue, Ms. Tanaka said she had come to understand that she had more to lose from coming out in the open and could not afford to become a poster woman for female liberation. ""When I first came to see the lawyers, I was prepared to reveal my name, my face and everything, but they advised me not to, saying I must think about my future,"" she said in the interview at her lawyer's office, explaining why she had testified from behind a screen throughout the trial. ""Since then I have come to understand the need to remain anonymous,"" Ms. Tanaka added. ""There are lots of generations in Japan. The term sexual harassment itself didn't exist here 10 years ago, which is unbelievable to me. ""There are many women who still don't understand it today. And I have become skeptical that even if I went public I would ever be able to inform people about what it means. Most people would just look at the settlement and say, 'Look at all the money she got.' "" Ms. Tanaka was awarded nearly $89,000 in her civil suit, the largest settlement of its kind in Japan to date. In a separate trial, her molester, Mr. Yokoyama, who resigned from office in disgrace, was given an 18-month suspended sentence for indecent assault. What is foremost among her fears, though, she said, is that she may not be able to get a job if her name becomes known. ""Companies don't want to hire 'dangerous women,' who make a fuss about sexual harassment,"" Ms. Tanaka said. ""This is a society full of prejudice against women. They will always say you have trouble because you were kind to the man, or that your clothes were too feminine, enticing men by spreading your pheromones around."" Japan possesses the world's second-largest economy and has boasted social achievements like universal literacy since the 19th century. But according to the United Nations, the country ranks only 41st out of 70 countries in terms of sexual equality, using a series of United Nations measures that include salaries and political power. The United States was No. 13, and Norway was No. 1. Women make up just 0.1 percent of the board members of Japan's top companies, according to one recent private survey, and are largely confined to clerical or ceremonial jobs in the corporate world, where they are expected to marry and move on after a few years, rather than to make careers. Sexual harassment, meanwhile, remains a deeply entrenched practice. The first government workplace rules against it were put in place only in April 1999, and still carry no clear penalties for offenders. In a recent survey of female civil servants, 70 percent said they had been sexually harassed. Mayumi Hareno, a 43-year-old freelance writer and occasional speaker on sexual harassment issues, understands the pressures that Ms. Tanaka is feeling. As the first woman to bring a sex-related harassment case in Japan, a decade ago, Ms. Hareno has lived them. ""In Japan there is sort of a culture in which women are always held responsible,"" said Ms. Hareno, who was fired from her job as a magazine editor in Fukuoka when she complained about a superior spreading rumors about her sex life. ""Even though the woman is the victim, people will always say she bears responsibility for her troubles. We have a very strong culture of shame."" Ms. Hareno preserved her anonymity for a time after her case went to trial, as Japanese courts allow, but eventually felt that she had to go public, in order to encourage and assist other women. In the decade since her trial, complaints to the Ministry of Labor have ballooned, but there have been only about 100 sexual harassment cases nationwide, according to a recent government study on the condition of women. ""When I talk to the victims of sexual harassment they often lack the courage to file lawsuits,"" Ms. Hareno said. ""Sometimes they can't even talk to their parents about what happened, because their parents, being older, feel an even stronger sense of shame."" This shame is reinforced by the way the news media here cover matters of discrimination and harassment, often belittling the woman involved and recounting salacious details in a voyeuristic fashion. Popular news weeklies carry glossy pictures of nude women and sometimes include features on subjects like the adventures of subway gropers. On one recent Sunday news program, the mayor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, attributed the aggressive style of the first woman to serve as foreign minister of Japan to menopause. In many Western countries this would have produced an outcry, and perhaps have led to his resignation. But rather than contesting the statement or even expressing surprise, the other panelists nodded and wondered aloud if indeed menopause might be the explanation. The news media reinforce the reluctance of many women to come forward in other ways too. ""The woman in the Fukuoka case may have disclosed her name after the trial, but the Japanese media paid no attention to her,"" said Masaomi Kaneko, a Tokyo city government employee who has written books on sexual harassment. ""The media ignores what people like this have to say. How could she become an Anita Hill if the media don't report her words? It is a really lamentable situation, but it is part of why it is so difficult to change things."" Seen in this light, Ms. Tanaka's case could be viewed as a rare opportunity lost by Japanese women. At the moment of her victory, last August, when Mr. Yokoyama addressed the court to say, ""I accept the verdict. I apologize deeply to the victim and hope she recovers as soon as possible,"" the entire nation's attention was briefly focused on the trial. Instead of standing on the courthouse stairs, surrounded by supporters united in a vow to fight impunity and the shame borne by victims here, Ms. Tanaka was hustled off behind drawn curtains and savored the victory in private. Japan's feminist movement is still small and relatively weak, and has little experience of heroes. Many of its members say that the outcome was perhaps the best they could have hoped for. ""Even though she has remained anonymous, she has released a very good book, which is a way of going public,"" said Kazue Muta, a professor of women's studies at Konan Women's University in Kobe. ""Identifying oneself is important, but it is not always necessary. She was raped, in a sense, and if she comes out, people will know that she is a sexually abused person, which is a disgrace in Japan. ""I don't think it is a disgrace, but many people do.""",2001,"Japan"
"89","Japan Begins to Accept Stalking Is a Problem; New Law Lets Police Act on Threats","Asia","Akiko Kobayakawa endured three years of living hell when a male stalker called her as many as 50 times a day, followed her relentlessly, hit her, broke windows and threatened to burn down her office. Police ignored the businesswoman's pleas, arguing that no laws were broken and the matter was a private dispute. Terrified, Kobayakawa finally found a security firm to chase the man away. The feeling of helplessness so unnerved her, however, that last year she opened Humanity Co., an anti-stalking service offering counseling, legal assistance and bodyguards. A few months later, Japan recognized the long-ignored problem by passing an anti-stalking law that allows police to act on threats rather than waiting until a victim is maimed or murdered. Although the law is only a few months old, supporters say it is helping to strengthen women's rights here. ""Japanese society has long ignored these very serious human rights violations, treating them as domestic issues,"" said Mizuho Fukushima, a lawmaker in the upper house of parliament. ""Now stalking is finally recognized as a crime."" Penalties are relatively light by Western standards -- a maximum of one year in jail or an $ 8,700 fine compared with as many as 20 years in some U.S. states. But lawmakers say the threat of arrest and public humiliation is a strong deterrent in a nation where shame remains a powerful social force. Still, women's rights advocates face an uphill battle in a society that frowns on upsetting the wa, or group harmony. Japanese art and history often draw a blurry line between the passionate suitor and the psychopathic stalker. The Konjaku Monogatari tales written around 1120 detail an aristocrat's lengthy obsession with a beautiful court attendant who was forced to devise intricate strategies to avoid his advances. The new law was spurred by the 1999 murder-for-hire of 21-year-old Shiori Ino after she was stalked for 10 months by a former boyfriend who later committed suicide. The police repeatedly ignored her pleas and then allegedly forged documents to cover up their dismissive response. The incident sparked awareness of the problem -- there were 11,543 stalking complaints in the first half of last year compared with 8,021 for all of 1999 -- and sent a message that it's acceptable to fight back. One survey found 25 percent of women in their twenties and thirties had been stalked. At the AXIS.K studio here, martial arts expert Kazue Higashiyama leads classes called Goshinbics, or Anti-Stalking Aerobics, a program she created after being threatened by several men. ""Men's fingers can be quite stiff, so twisting them can be very effective,"" she told a class of women in their thirties, running them through feints, kicks and punches. ""Bend his arm, pin him against the wall, then yell for help."" Companies, meanwhile, are reporting strong sales of chemical sprays, pocket alarms, stun guns, spy cameras, wiretap detectors, caller ID and detective services. Two insurers have sold thousands of anti-stalker policies that pledge to identify violators, tap the customer's phone, record or videotape stalkers and pay as much as $ 75,000 if the buyer is killed -- for $ 450 a year. Elsewhere, hundreds of Web sites have sprouted, offering protection and comfort. ""We'll solve your stalker problem,"" says the House of Stalker Busters Co. ""Turn anxiety into security. Free consultation."" Security company Stalker 110 offers something for every budget: $ 478 for a one-week investigation; $ 808 to confront your tormentor; $ 1,286 to collect evidence using hidden cameras. Other sites offer helpful tips: Hang men's underwear on the line, add a man's name to the mailbox, use male voices on your answering machine so stalkers think you're living with someone. In the end, though, most of these only exploit women's fears without addressing the real problem, said Humanity Co.'s Kobayakawa. Her service counsels the victim, targets the stalker and exploits his weakness, which may include a call to his wife, boss or parents. If all else fails, she hires bodyguards, orchestrates police warnings, recommends lawyers and provides counseling for victims. ""Controlling women makes some Japanese men feel better about themselves,"" she said. ""The law doesn't fix everything. But it's become much easier for women to raise their voices.""",2001,"Japan"
"90","Chinese-Born Scholar at AU Held by Beijing; Husband, Child Released After 26 Days in Custody","Asia","A Chinese-born political scientist at American University who does research on women's issues and China-Taiwan relations has been detained in China for more than a month, her husband said today. The Foreign Ministry said she was suspected of ""engaging in activities damaging state security."" Chinese officers detained Gao Zhan, 40, an unpaid faculty fellow at AU's School of International Service, as well as her husband and their 5-year-old son at the Beijing airport on Feb. 11 as they prepared to return to Washington. Gao's husband, Xue Donghua, and their child, Andrew, were released 26 days later. Xue said they were held in separate locations and officers refused to let him, his wife or other relatives see Andrew. Speaking by telephone from the Washington area, Xue said he was told he could see his son only if he first incriminated his wife. He refused, he said, because ""she is absolutely innocent."" ""My wife has been detained for almost 40 days now. . . . They wouldn't even let me see her before I left,"" said Xue, a D.C.-based manager for Electronic Data Systems Corp. ""I'm very worried because she has heart disease and other health problems."" Xue said he sought help from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing immediately, but waited to speak out publicly because the Chinese officers warned him that doing so would make matters worse. He said he changed his mind because ""waiting hasn't worked."" The New York-based group Human Rights in China urged President Bush to ask for Gao's release when he meets with Vice Premier Qian Qichen in Washington on Thursday. The group said the detentions violated Chinese and international law. American University President Benjamin Ladner said he has written letters to Bush, Qian, U.S. Ambassador Joseph W. Prueher in Beijing and Chinese Ambassador Yang Jiechi in Washington urging their intervention. ""As an institution of higher learning, we are concerned if a scholar is being detained for any reason that might be related to legitimate inquiry or research,"" he said in a statement. ""We ask that both governments work to provide complete information surrounding this incident and that Dr. Gao be allowed to rejoin her family as soon as possible."" Ladner's chief of staff, David Taylor, said Gao is not a professor at the university but a research scholar, a status ""that allows her to do research and participate in the life of the university."" The appointment runs from October 2000 through September, he said. Louis W. Goodman, dean of the School of International Service, said Gao is one of eight or nine visiting fellows attached to the school's Center for Asian Studies and that she is very sociable with a strong command of English. Her topics -- women's issues and the study of how Chinese educated abroad readjust when they return -- are ""pretty standard issues,"" he added. ""That was one of the things that was surprising to me,"" Goodman said. ""There seemed to be nothing controversial about her research topic. We do not know what she's been charged with. We're kind of puzzled and alarmed at the circumstances."" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States has asked Chinese authorities about Gao's detention and urged them ""to release her immediately."" Gao and Xue are Chinese citizens who immigrated to the United States in 1989. That was the year of the bloody crackdown against demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, but Xue said neither he nor his wife were part of the protests. American University said the two have applied to become U.S. citizens and their son already is a U.S. citizen. China failed to inform the U.S. Embassy of the boy's detention as required by treaty, an embassy official said in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Gao is under investigation for activities harming national security and the case will be handled according to Chinese criminal statutes. The ministry did not say specifically what Gao did that aroused suspicions. ""It's all nonsense,"" Xue said. ""She's just an academic, a scholar. She's not doing anything against the Chinese government. We wouldn't do that."" Xue said he and his wife were planning to return to China and had been looking for teaching jobs at Chinese universities in their home cities of Xian and Nanjing after spending Chinese New Year with relatives. ""We wanted to go back and do something for the country,"" he said. Xue said security officers blindfolded him and drove him to a house about two hours from the airport. There, he said, he was confined to a room and was not allowed to contact relatives or a lawyer. He said the officers repeatedly questioned him about his wife's work and two visits she made to Taiwan in 1995 and 1999. Both trips were academic exchanges organized by the Association of Chinese Political Studies, according to a Chinese colleague, who asked not to be identified. He said Gao was among 15 scholars on both trips who visited Taiwanese research organizations, universities and government officials. Gao's research focuses primarily on Chinese family and women's issues, Xue said, but she also has written on China's relations with Taiwan, the island that Beijing considers part of its territory. For example, she wrote an article last year that examined the role of women in Taiwanese politics and contrasted the high level of political participation by women there with lower levels in China. This is the third time in as many years that Chinese-born academics have been detained after returning to China from the United States. In 1999, a librarian from Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, Song Yongyi, was detained while doing research on the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. He was accused of stealing state secrets, but released six months later. In 1998, Stanford University researcher Hua Di was arrested during his first visit to his homeland in 11 years and accused of leaking military secrets. A former Chinese military official and a specialist on China's nuclear and missile program, Hua was sentenced to 10 years in prison last November.

"91","U.S. Resists 'Comfort Women' Suit; Japan's War Actions Are Covered by Treaties, Officials Say","Asia","The Bush administration is seeking the dismissal of a class-action lawsuit filed against Japan last year on behalf of hundreds of Asian women who said they were forced into serving as sex slaves during World War II. Although U.S. officials said they had ""deep sympathy"" for the women, they maintained they are bound by U.S. and international law to step into the case on the side of the Japanese government. Japan is entitled to sovereign immunity, and its wartime activities were dealt with decades ago through treaties, they said. The plaintiffs, known as ""comfort women,"" allege they were kidnapped, tricked or coerced into serving as sex slaves by the Japanese military during the 1930s and 1940s. The women say they were kept in deplorable conditions and raped, beaten and tortured. U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. has not set a hearing date on Japan's motion to throw out their lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money from Japan and declarations it acted illegally. ""We recognize and sympathize deeply with the terrible suffering endured by those who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II,"" said a State Department official who did not want to be identified. ""Nonetheless, the United States government position . . . is that the court does not have jurisdiction and may not hear the case."" The Bush administration entered the dispute late last month by filing a ""statement of interest"" that sided with Japan's position. Plaintiffs' lawyers condemned the U.S. intervention. ""I don't use this term or characterization lightly, but this is one of the most outrageous positions I've ever seen the United States take on issues involving fundamental human rights,"" said Michael D. Hausfeld, the women's lawyer. The Japanese government has not paid reparations to any of the estimated 200,000 women, most of whom came from Korea. In 1995, then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued ""profound apologies"" for what took place. At the time, Japan set up a fund for private contributions to be used as compensation for the comfort women, and more than 170 women have received what Japan calls ""atonement money."" The Japanese courts have provided no relief. In March, the Hiroshima High Court overturned a 1998 ruling that had awarded about $ 2,400 each to three South Korean women. Hausfeld's clients want their day in an American court. Now in their seventies and eighties, the women want to travel to the courthouse in Washington from homes in Korea, China, Taiwan and the Philippines to tell their story to a judge and jury. Although the women are not U.S. citizens, they turned to the courts here under the Alien Tort Claims Act, a 212-year-old federal law that gives foreigners the right to file federal lawsuits for crimes committed in violation of international law. Hausfeld and co-counsel Elizabeth H. Cronise said they also have legal standing under a law passed by Congress last year that bars trafficking of people for sex. Hausfeld maintained the case is about ""mass crimes"" and human rights violations, not military activities. If Japan is found to be immune from damages, he said, ""any country, any time, anywhere, could enslave women and children, rape them, sterilize them, torture them . . .  and be immunized from legal accountability to their victims."" Craig A. Hoover, a lawyer representing the Japanese government, declined to comment. U.S. government lawyers made clear they were not defending the soldiers' conduct, writing, ""The horror of plaintiffs' ordeal can scarcely be overstated."" But, they added, the court lacks jurisdiction. Japan is entitled to sovereign immunity under U.S. laws and agreements in effect during the war and under laws enacted afterward, according to Justice Department lawyers, joined by the State Department in the court filing. If the court ruled otherwise, government lawyers warned, the United States could find itself subject to lawsuits in other countries for acts such as the 1988 incident in which a U.S. warship mistakenly downed an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf. The United States later agreed to pay $ 61.8 million to the families of 248 victims. The comfort women's lawsuit also cannot move forward, the Justice Department stated, because Japan satisfied war claims decades ago through treaties, giving up about $ 4 billion in assets held in Allied nations. The government also warned that court action ""could have a potentially serious negative impact on U.S.-Japan relations.""",2001,"Japan"
"92","Pakistani Group Offers Bleak View of Pakistan's Rights Record","Asia","A report by a Pakistani human rights organization paints a bleak picture of respect for human dignity here, particularly for women and children. Every day, on average, two women are victims of so-called honor killings, slain by a male relative for having ""dishonored"" the family name, usually by marrying without permission. The killers are rarely punished, the report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan notes. Over all, the report says, women have ""almost no rights"" and are ""bound to follow the wishes of male family members."" Nearly half the country's children are malnourished, physical and sexual abuse of children is ""rampant"" and young boys are smuggled to the Middle East to serve as jockeys in camel races, the report says. ""There is a lack of governance, and a gap between the rhetoric and actual practices,"" Asma Jehangir, a lawyer and a member of the executive council of the organization, said today, summarizing the report. Government officials have made repeated promises to improve the plight of women, but they have failed to act, Ms. Jehangir said. ""When so many things are happening in this region, important things like human rights are not put in their proper perspective,"" she said. The organization does commend the government of President Pervez Musharraf for getting tougher on Islamic militants who carry out acts of violence. In the past, these militant groups have had the support of Pakistan's intelligence services. General Musharraf has banned several militant groups and detained hundreds of men suspected of terrorist acts. But the rights group said the measures ""appeared to be motivated by a need to appease powerful forces abroad, rather than a commitment to serve the interests of people within the country."" Political activity has been restricted by the government of General Musharraf, who seized power in 1999. The organization's 369-page report, ""State of Human Rights in 2001,"" was issued on Wednesday. Founded in 1986, the group now has offices throughout the country and a Web site, www.hrcp-web.org. Expanding the conventional definition of human rights beyond issues like press and religious freedom, elections, and torture and killings by the police, the report looks at social and economic conditions, including health and education. The mortality rate for mothers is 700 per 100,000 live births, one of the highest in the world. The infant mortality rate is 91 per 100,000 live births, the highest in South Asia. The government spends less than 1 percent of the gross national product on health, a smaller percentage than in Haiti, Bangladesh or Ethiopia, according to the report. Earlier this month, the United States State Department, in its annual human rights report, had a similarly critical assessment of Pakistan. The State Department said the judiciary was marked by corruption and inefficiency and was subject to government pressure; the police committed murder, rape and other abuses; ""debt slavery persisted""; and women ""were subjected to violence, abuse, rape and other forms of degradation."" On the positive side, the State Department concluded that the Pakistani press was able to publish ""relatively freely,"" although there was some self-censorship on important intelligence and military matters.",2002,"Pakistan"

"94","Seeing No Justice, a Rape Victim Chooses Death","Asia","Naseem Mai told the police she would kill herself if the man who raped her was not arrested. She told her doctor, too. Then, before her eyes, across a cotton field, the rapist escaped from the policemen who were trying -- not very hard, her family says -- to arrest him. ""I was cooking,"" Ms. Mai's grandmother, Bahara Bibi, 70, recalled. ""Naseem was shouting, 'You are letting the guilty one go!' I looked up and saw her drop the bottle. She walked out and fell to the ground."" Ms. Mai, 26, drank most of a bottle of the pesticide used in the same cotton fields where, two nights earlier on June 28, two men held her at gunpoint as a third man raped her. She had not eaten since then. That is why death came so quickly, her family believes, before she even made it to the hospital on June 30. A week later, the police did arrest the man, Riaz Pirhar. Then again, the police are under enormous pressure here. Just one village away lives Mukhtaran Bibi, who had been raped by four men on orders from a tribal council, a case that repulsed Pakistan and put a rare, harsh spotlight on the widespread incidence of rape here. Even so, Ms. Mai's family has little faith that Mr. Pirhar, who is from a landowning family and can thus afford to bribe the police, will face justice in the end. They said poor people like themselves, in this remote part of southern Punjab Province, are not treated fairly before the law. ""This kind of crime will stop only when people get punished severely and properly,"" said Ms. Mai's sister, Ruskhsana, 19. The police, along with Pakistan's wobbly legal system, are facing an unusual test. Since Ms. Bibi's case made national headlines here, after she was gang raped on June 22, the number of women reporting rape has skyrocketed. The regional police chief in the nearest big town, Muzaffargarh, said that at least one woman a day had filed a complaint of rape. Normally there are four or five reports in a month. And so far the response of the chief, Farman Ali, has some human rights advocates wondering. ""Every second girl wants to be Mukhtaran,"" Mr. Ali said, adding that most women want the attention and money that have flowed Ms. Bibi's way. ""Mostly they are fabricated."" Mr. Ali does seem to be aggressively pursuing the cases of Ms. Bibi and Ms. Mai. But Asma Jehangir, the most prominent female lawyer and women's rights advocate in Pakistan, said his offhand dismissal of some of the others was worrying. ""Women have been encouraged to report the crime of rape now,"" she said, noting that in the case of Ms. Bibi, at least, the government of Gen. Pervez Musharraf moved swiftly. ""We are, of course, receiving information that they are getting very disappointed."" She said it was highly unlikely that a woman in Pakistan would invent rape charges. Pakistani society, she said, places deep value on a woman's honor and chastity, both of which evaporate as soon as she accuses someone of rape. Moreover, some 60 percent of women who lodge complaints of rape -- which requires two witnesses for a conviction -- are later charged themselves, under Pakistan's Islamic-based laws, with having had sex outside of marriage. Ms. Jehangir said that, given those social and legal risks, even she would hesitate before accusing someone of rape. ""I know it is an awful thing to say,"" she said. ""But this is the truth of the matter. There is a callousness to even trying to understand the pressures under which women live in Pakistan."" The government says it is aware of the problems and is working to ensure justice for women. Attiya Inayatullah, the minister for women's development, said there were plans to speed up criminal cases, some of which drag on for years, to appoint more female judges and to open family courts as well as crisis centers and shelters for abused women. But much depends, Ms. Inayatullah acknowledged, on Pakistan's volatile politics. Elections scheduled for October may end General Musharraf's relatively benign military dictatorship. ""Once you put these things on track, they have to be instituted,"" she said. ""Now you need political will, which has been lacking."" In places like southern Punjab, the reach of national justice is so weak -- and inconsistent, poor people say -- that victims often settle matters informally through tribal councils like the one that ordered Ms. Bibi raped after her brother was accused of an illicit relationship. But in the case of Ms. Mai, her family wanted the police involved. To start, there was little doubt about what had happened: on the night of June 28, three men kidnapped Ms. Mai, the oldest of eight children in a family of small-time farmers and laborers, as she slept outside in the overwhelming heat. Her brother woke up, and family members say they then caught the men, including Mr. Pirhar, in the act, in a field about 100 yards away. The doctor who examined her, a woman named Shahida Safdar, said Ms. Mai showed signs of having resisted along with other evidence of rape. ""There is no doubt in rape,"" she said. Ms. Mai told the doctor she wanted to kill herself. A few days later, Dr. Safdar found herself at Ms. Mai's autopsy. In her experience, Dr. Safdar said, ""only 1 percent"" of rape cases are reported, and cases like Ms. Mai's are heart-hardeningly common. ""I had a feeling of sorrow,"" Dr. Safdar said, ""but it was not as deep as it should have been."" Mr. Pirhar's arrest did not come quickly. A week after he escaped from the police, he surrendered, having been protected in the meantime in the home of a local politician. Another suspect has also been arrested. Ms. Mai's family says that Mr. Pirhar's family bribed a police officer -- the same one who has been arrested over allegations of misconduct in Ms. Bibi's case. Even the police acknowledge that money influences the course of justice and that victims' complaints are sometimes justified. ""They do blame the police, and in certain cases they are blaming rightly,"" said Inspector Abdul Latif Khan, who was appointed head of the local police department after a shake-up over Ms. Bibi's case. ""But in most cases, the police do not take bribes."" Ms. Mai's family has another experience with rape that does not make them hopeful. One of Ms. Mai's cousins, Faz Mai, 20, said that she was raped almost two years ago, and that the suspect remains free as his case wears on. Seven months after the rape, she said, she gave birth to his child. She put the baby into an orphanage, without even giving the child a name. ""This was not my true child,"" she said. Now there are rumors that the suspect is trying to flee to Dubai, where he has relatives. The family hopes that the police will not let him escape. ""All we want is justice,"" said Naseem Mai's younger brother, Munir. ""Justice can prevent future crimes.""",2002,"Pakistan"
"95","Religious Riots Loom Over Indian Politics","Asia","Here in the adopted hometown of Mohandas K. Gandhi, the great apostle of nonviolence, Hindu mobs committed acts of unspeakable savagery against Muslims this spring. Mothers were skewered on swords as their children watched. Young women were stripped and raped in broad daylight, then doused with kerosene and set on fire. A pregnant woman's belly was slit open, her fetus raised skyward on the tip of a sword and then tossed onto one of the fires that blazed across the city. The violence raged for days and persisted for more than two months, claiming almost 1,000 lives. It was driven by hatred and sparked by a terrible crime: a Muslim mob stoned a train car loaded with activists from the World Hindu Council on Feb. 27, then set it on fire, killing 59 people, mostly women and children. The carnage that followed here in the western state of Gujarat has become a festering political sore because of widespread allegations that the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Hindu nationalist party that leads India and Gujarat, and the World Hindu Council were complicit in the attacks on Muslims. The party and the council -- both part of the same Hindu nationalist family -- deny the charges. But official statistics provided in June by the Police Department, now under new administration, show that the state of Gujarat -- the only major one in India governed solely by the Bharatiya Janata Party -- failed to take elementary steps to halt the horrific momentum of violence. The day after the train attack, police officers here in Ahmedabad did not arrest a single person from among the tens of thousands who rampaged through Muslim enclaves, raping and looting as well as burning alive 124 Muslims. Police officials and survivors said in interviews that workers and officials of the party and the council were complicit in the attacks and, in some cases, instigated the mobs. ""This was not a riot,"" one senior police official said angrily. ""It was a state-sponsored pogrom."" Party officials who lead the national government, while publicly condemning the attacks, dispatched soldiers to restore order but resisted opposition calls for a forceful assertion of the central government's authority to halt the violence. Fathoming what happened here in the first major outbreak of Hindu-Muslim violence in almost a decade is critical for India. The specter of such violence has shadowed the country since its birth. India, a secular democracy, and Pakistan, an Islamic nation, were hacked apart when they won independence from Britain in 1947. The furies of religious hatred were unleashed, and about a million people died. The use of religion for political gain is an enduring theme in both India and Pakistan and a wellspring of violence that vexes the subcontinent even today. Senior national leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, including Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have maintained that India's tolerant Hindu ethos has helped guarantee religious freedom for India's billion-strong population, which includes 820 million Hindus and 130 million Muslims. Until the violence in Gujarat, the party, which has led the national government since 1998, had proudly pointed to the absence of Hindu-Muslim violence during its years in power as evidence of its secular credentials. But many influential Indians are once again questioning whether the party can be trusted to ensure that Hindus and Muslims live together in peace and to resist the temptation of exploiting religious divisions to reap Hindu votes. Gujarat, a state of 51 million people, has over the past decade become the country's laboratory for Hindu nationalism. That ideology has long depicted Muslim and Christian Indians as converts to foreign religions who must accept the primacy of Hindu culture. Gandhi's assassin was an extreme adherent of this view. In the recent carnage in Gujarat, most of those killed were Muslims. Among the survivors, 100,000 became refugees in their own country. More than 20,000 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, along with 360 Muslim places of worship. The events have inspired an anguished outpouring from many Indian intellectuals. ""Gujarat disowned Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi long ago,"" Ashis Nandy, one of India's leading social thinkers wrote in Seminar, a monthly magazine that addresses domestic and international problems in India. ""The state's political soul has been won over by his killers."" In an interview in June, the state's chief minister, Narendra Modi, offered no consolation to the state's Muslims and expressed satisfaction with his government's performance. His only regret, he said, was that he did not handle the news media better. ""We have 18,600 villages,"" he said in his office, where a photograph of Gandhi hung on the wall. ""Ninety-eight percent of Gujarat was peaceful. Is it not a credit for the administration, the government?"" Mr. Modi was a longtime party organizer and pracharak, or preacher, from the source of the Hindu nationalist movement, the Association of National Volunteers. He was handpicked less than a year ago by the Bharatiya Janata Party's high command to turn around its fading fortunes in the state. Mr. Modi dissolved the state assembly on July 19 to bring on elections. In the usual practice, he resigned and was named caretaker chief minister while he led the party's political campaign. At the national level, too, hard-liners in the party appear to be on the upswing. Lal Krishna Advani, India's home minister, who represents Gujarat in Parliament, was elevated recently to be India's deputy prime minister and is expected to succeed Mr. Vajpayee as the coalition's standard-bearer. Mr. Advani led a movement to build a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, on the site of a 16th-century mosque said to be the birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram. That movement was critical to the party's rise to power and culminated in the mosque's demolition by Hindu zealots in 1992, igniting the last major spasm of Hindu-Muslim violence, which left more than 1,100 people dead, most of them Muslims. Mr. Advani said he regretted the mosque's destruction, just as he has decried the violence in Gujarat. Still, he stood by Mr. Modi, and at a recent news conference, said that Mr. Modi's government had generally performed well. Others disagree. The National Human Rights Commission, headed by a retired chief justice of the Supreme Court, concluded that the state's efforts were ""a comprehensive failure."" The commission released a confidential report on June 12 that named officials from the Bharatiya Janata Party who have been accused by survivors and witnesses of instigating the violence. It noted that many politically connected people were yet to be arrested. ""These are grave matters indeed,"" the commission wrote, ""that must not be allowed to be forgiven or forgotten."" An Attack and a Vengeful Mob The train that pulled into Godhra station at 7:43 a.m. on Feb. 27 was packed with more than 1,500 volunteers of the World Hindu Council, who were returning from Ayodhya, where they had agitated once again for construction of a temple on the site of the demolished mosque. Roused by religious fervor, hundreds of devotees poured out of the train at Godhra station, which is in the middle of a densely packed Muslim slum. A Muslim vendor was ordered to say ""Hail Ram"" and refused. The Hindu activists yanked his beard and beat him, said a state police investigator. As the train pulled out, an angry Muslim crowd pelted it with stones. No one seems certain why, but the mob's fury focused on coach S6. Stones crashed through the windows. A flaming rag soared inside, landing on a synthetic leather seat that caught fire. Police investigators say that as many as 16 gallons of gasoline were poured onto the floor. Fifty-nine people were killed. Fury over the atrocity came fast. Within hours, a Muslim driver was pulled from his rickshaw and killed with a cricket bat. Hindu mobs burned down shops in the city and threw stones at a mosque. Rumors fed anger. Giriraj Kishore, a national leader of the World Hindu Council, said in an interview that day that Hindu girls had been abducted by Muslims and raped, an account the police later said was false. The World Hindu Council called a general strike for the following day, Feb. 28, to protest the killings. Senior police officials say the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's endorsement of the strike made violence virtually inevitable. Mashiha Qureshi, an 11-year-old Muslim girl, and her family fled to the safety of Juhapura, the city's largest Muslim ghetto. The family's house was gutted by fire. She is now afraid to live among Hindus. ""Somebody might catch me, kill me, throw me under a train,"" she said. ""There are good people. There are bad people. Some save you, some kill you. But how do you know which is which?"" The chief minister, Mr. Modi, said he gave clear instructions that the police were to deal with any violence firmly. But in a country where authorities routinely round up suspects to head off Hindu-Muslim violence, the Ahmedabad police did not make a single preventive arrest the day of the train attack, city police officials said. P. C. Pande, who was city police commissioner at the time, and C. K. Chakravarthi, who heads the state police, refused repeated requests for interviews. Other senior police officials -- sickened by what happened, but unwilling to be quoted by name -- contradicted Mr. Modi. One official said the chief minister directed that the police ""should not come down harshly on the Hindus tomorrow."" As a result, they said, no clear orders were given. Two large massacres took place on Feb. 28 in Ahmedabad, a gritty city of 3.5 million people, as the police stood by or, according to some witnesses, aided the mobs. Thirty-nine people were killed at the Gulbarg Society, a walled compound that was home to Muslim families in the midst of a largely Hindu neighborhood. The mob started gathering in the morning. By early afternoon, more than 10,000 Hindu men assembled, many armed with stones, iron rods, tridents, swords and homemade bombs, screaming: ""Beat them! Burn them! Cut them!"" Muslim women and children in the neighborhood had gathered in the home of Ehsan Jafri, a Muslim and a former member of Parliament from the Congress Party. They believed he could protect them. Through the day, witnesses said, Mr. Jafri made increasingly frantic calls to the city police commissioner and other powerful people, among them Amarsinh Chaudhary, who was the state Congress Party president and a former chief minister of Gujarat. Mr. Chaudhary said he, in turn, called the heads of the city and state police forces. The third and last time Mr. Jafri called, he wept, begging: ""Kindly help me. They will kill me. My society is burning."" The police arrived in numbers only large enough to take on the mob at about 4 or 5 p.m. -- too late to save the women and children, who burned to death with Mr. Jafri, survivors said. The next day, the smell of roasted flesh still hung heavy in the ruins of the residential complex. K. G. Erda, a senior police inspector, was standing outside, watching as people carried on with their looting. He said the few officers who had been there the day before had stayed in the traffic intersections, only firing at the mob when it stoned the police. He and other officers had called for reinforcements, he said, but none came. In fact, he said, 10 policemen, including two high-ranking officers, were called away. ""What can two or three policemen do when confronted by 20,000 people?"" Mr. Erda asked. The second massacre of Muslims unfolded in a poor area called Naroda Patia, where 11-year-old Mashiha and her family lived. Many survivors accuse people from Hindu nationalist groups, among them Bipin Panchal, known to many as Bipin Bhai, of leading the mob. A man in the World Hindu Council's front office confirmed that Mr. Panchal was a council worker. Days after the atrocity, Mr. Panchal said his shop had been damaged by fire and looted. The Muslims had attacked, he claimed, and he had only defended himself. ""They live here in India and pray for Pakistan,"" he said contemptuously. ""They only deserve one treatment. They should pack their bags and board the train to Pakistan. There should be no Muslims here."" He denied even belonging to the World Hindu Council. Mr. Panchal has since been charged with being a leader of the mob and is said to have absconded. However, an official at the Naroda police station said the police knew where he was but had been instructed not to arrest him. On the day these two massacres took place, Feb. 28, no one was arrested for participating in the violence. The next day, 55 people were killed, but only 93 arrests were made. State officials would later point to the large number of Hindus arrested to prove the police were vigilant. Here in the city the police have arrested more than 3,500 people -- but those arrests came belatedly, after the carnage had already gotten out of control. Asked about the failure to make arrests early on, Mr. Modi, the chief minister, asserted that the police had fired into the mobs to halt the violence. Yet in the three days after the train attack -- when Muslims were overwhelmingly the victims of violence -- the police killed more Muslims than Hindus, 22 to 14, in what was ostensibly an effort to stop attacks on Muslims. An alliance of nonprofit groups surveyed almost 2,800 Muslim families who accused the Bharatiya Janata Party or affiliated Hindu nationalist groups of involvement in the violence. But Mr. Modi dismissed the charges. ""Not a single complaint has been registered like this,"" he insisted. Instead of rooting out those who may have been complicit, Mr. Modi used his authority to penalize officers who enforced the law, senior police officials say. They cite what they describe as punitive transfers of four police superintendents in March. Mr. Modi called the transfers a ""purely administrative decision."" But several officials confirmed that Mr. Chakravarthi, who heads the state police, wrote a letter protesting the transfers and commending the men for their handling of the violence. The transferred police officials told dramatic stories of confronting mobs. Himanshu Bhatt recalled arriving at a Muslim village surrounded by a Hindu mob of 15,000 that was brandishing swords and scythes. Already, 14 Muslims had been killed. Mr. Bhatt immediately gave the order to fire. A deputy headman from a neighboring Hindu village was killed, and the mob ran away. Mr. Bhatt said he took great pride that all the Muslim inhabitants were home cooking dinner by the next evening. Rahul Sharma, another officer, described rescuing 400 children, ages 6 to 14, at an Islamic school that was surrounded by a mob of 8,000 armed with swords, pipes and soda bottle bombs. ""We fired tear gas, but the wind was against us and it blew back on us,"" he said. ""So we fired three rounds of musket fire. Four or five were injured. The entire crowd vanished."" ""I don't think any other job would have allowed me to save so many lives,"" he said. ""That is a bank balance for a lifetime."" As the violence in Gujarat continued into April, the political and civic outcry across the country rose, as did pressure on the central government. Mr. Modi's role became an issue, with even some of the Bharatiya Janata Party's own allies calling for his dismissal. After a bruising debate in Parliament, the central government finally dispatched a senior retired police officer, K. P. S. Gill, to advise Mr. Modi. Mr. Gill arrived on May 3 and within days, the city's three top police officials were replaced. K. R. Kaushik, the new police commissioner, said he immediately issued orders for the police to arrest anyone gathering in a mob. By the evening of the next day, May 11, he said, the violence was under control. Unapologetic, Separate, Hopeful Today, there is no more apt symbol of the divide between Hindus and Muslims in Ahmedabad than the road separating Juhapura, the Muslim ghetto where so many sought refuge during the carnage, from neighboring Hindu areas. The Hindu houses back up to barbed wire fences and high brick walls topped with jagged shards of glass. The windows in virtually every house on both sides were shattered in the rock throwing that accompanied the violence. It is as though the Muslims of Juhapura and the Hindus in adjacent neighborhoods live in separate nations. They refer to the road that divides them as a border. It looked like a war zone that has come under heavy shelling. But as desolate as the road looks today, it ends on a green field, called Unity Ground, where Hindus and Muslims used to play cricket together. Days after her husband, the former Muslim parliamentarian, was burned alive by a mob, Zakia Jafri, 65, still clung to the idea of an India where Hindus and Muslims lived in peace. For years, she and her husband resisted their children's entreaties to leave their majority-Hindu neighborhood. Mrs. Jafri, haggard and grief-stricken, vowed to go home. ""That is my husband's memory and dream,"" she said. ""I will not abandon it."" But Mrs. Jafri said recently that none of her Hindu neighbors ever came to her to express sorrow that they could not save her husband. She asked, ""How can I go back to such a place?""",2002,"India"
"96","Yayori Matsui Dies at 68; Championed Asian Women","Asia","Yayori Matsui, a journalist and campaigner for the rights of Asian women, died on Dec. 27 at a Tokyo hospital. She was 68 and a resident of Tokyo. The cause was liver cancer, said an associate, Norma Field, professor of Japanese studies at the University of Chicago. Dr. Field said Ms. Matsui had reported her illness in a message to her associates in which she also outlined her ideas for a projected Women's Museum of War and Peace. Ms. Matsui was the founder, in 1998, of the Violence Against Women in War-Network, Japan. It was a principal sponsor of the Women's International War Crimes Trial held in Tokyo in 2000. A symbolic trial, it found Emperor Hirohito ultimately responsible for the policy by which the Japanese military forced Asian women into sexual slavery during World War II. It convicted other wartime leaders individually of crimes against humanity for their part in what was euphemistically called the ""comfort women"" system. Ms. Matsui was in the forefront of efforts to make Japanese school textbooks deal more openly with the realities of World War II. She traveled widely, writing and speaking about women as the victims of armed conflicts and social injustices. She was born in Kyoto. Her parents, both Christian missionaries, moved to Tokyo after the war to build the Yamate Christian Church in the devastated capital. Ms. Matsui's funeral was held there Monday, according to Margaret Mitsutani, a member of her Violence Against Women group in Tokyo. She said Ms. Matsui was survived by her parents and five siblings. Ms. Matsui worked for Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading newspapers, for 30 years, starting in the early 1960's. She reported from Singapore, worked as a senior staff writer and contributed articles on the environment, Asian affairs and women's issues. In 1976 she founded Asian Women in Solidarity, a grass-roots organization that grew out of opposition to ""sex tourism"" conducted for well-heeled visitors to Asia. This in turn led to the establishment in 1995 of the Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center in Tokyo, which researches women's issues, publishes a magazine, conducts seminars and sponsors lectures by Asian feminists. She was the author of ""Women in New Asia: From Pain to Power,"" published in Britain in 2000 and distributed here by St. Martin's Press. The Women's Museum, tentatively set to open in Tokyo in 2006, is to include a library and video archive documenting the fate of ""comfort women"" and violence against women in conflicts around the world. According to Ms. Mitsutani, Ms. Matsui was in Afghanistan meeting with Afghan feminists in October when her illness overtook her. She returned to Tokyo where she worked on plans for the women's museum.",2003,"Japan"

"98","Obstruction Is Charged in Sex Slavery Case","Asia","In November, a federal immigration agent flashed his badge at the door of a Queens apartment and told a frightened young woman from South Korea that he was there to deport her. The woman had been cooperating with the police against the owners of a Flushing bar that she said had held her captive in a case of human trafficking, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said yesterday. The woman said they beat her and tried to coerce her to become a prostitute to pay back an ever-growing debt. The immigration agent, Nisim Yushuvayev, was legitimate. But his threats were not, the prosecutors said in an obstruction-of-justice complaint they filed against him yesterday. They said he was in league with the bar owners to spirit the woman out of the country to keep her from providing prosecutors with more information against him. The story of the agent and the young South Korean woman provided a glimpse of the shadowy world of forced labor and what the prosecutors described as sex slavery in New York City. The prosecutors said the bar owners, Wun and Kyongja Kang, used promises of a better life in the United States to entice two young women from Seoul to work at the bar, the Renaissance Bar & Room Cafe in Flushing. Before one of the women slipped away and went to the police, the prosecutors said, the gentle promises made in Seoul ended with violence, sexual assaults and efforts to sell the women to a Chinatown brothel. The Kangs were arrested last month. They face federal forced labor charges and have been held without bail. They have pleaded not guilty. Until the Renaissance bar closed last month, neighbors said, men arrived each night. Inside, more than a dozen young South Korean women were hostesses. ""It's just a place where they get the guys to open their wallets,"" said a neighbor who refused to give his name yesterday. Across the country, prosecutors say, an unknown number of women, and some boys and men, are trapped each year in a desperate life of forced labor that sometimes involves sexual servitude. Often, they say, the victims are brought to this country by people who play on their hopes and then strand them here with big debts they cannot repay. Yesterday the United States attorney in Brooklyn, Roslynn R. Mauskopf, called such traffickers ""21st-century slave traders."" In the city, such stories come to light rarely, often in sketchy accounts from victims who can be as frightened of officials as they are of their captors. In another case last month, Brooklyn prosecutors charged four Mexican men living in Corona, Queens, with smuggling four women into this country to work at brothels in Brooklyn and Queens. Yesterday, the prosecutors said Kyongja Kang, 41, found the young women in South Korea on a trip there. They said she promised them respectable work keeping customers company and pouring them drinks. She told them, according to the complaint, that no sexual relations would be involved. Once here, though, the complaint said the agreed-upon $10,000 debt the women owed the bar owners for travel costs and rent mushroomed. The young women were never paid. Their passports were held by the bar owners, the complaint said. Soon, the prosecutors said, there were suggestions from people at the bar and Mr. Kang that it would be possible to work off the debt faster by selling themselves for sex. When they resisted the suggestions and tried to slip away, the prosecutors said, Mr. Kang sexually assaulted them and beat one of them. His lawyer, Charles A. Ross, said yesterday that his client was fighting the charges vigorously. In federal court in Brooklyn yesterday, an exhausted-looking Mr. Yushuvayev, 27, listened quietly as a federal prosecutor, Lee J. Freedman, told a federal magistrate that Mr. Yushuvayev had confessed after he was arrested on Friday. He said he acknowledged that he had gone to the Queens apartment and tried to take the young woman to Kennedy Airport in a livery cab. She ran away. But Oliver A. Smith, a lawyer for Mr. Yushuvayev, an inspector for the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, said he planned to contest all of the charges. Magistrate Judge Roanne L. Mann agreed to release Mr. Yushuvayev on $500,000 bond, but only after the court received proof of the value of homes pledged as security by his father, an immigrant from Uzbekistan. It was not clear from the court filings how Mr. Yushuvayev and the Kangs might have known each other. But the complaint said that after he was arrested last month, Mr. Kang admitted that he ""sent a man whom be believed to be an I.N.S. employee"" to the Queens apartment to get one of the South Korean woman to leave the country ""so that she could not testify against him.""",2004,"South Korea"
"99","Arrests Stop Pakistani Protest Run","Asia","A prominent women's rights activist was detained Saturday in the eastern city of Lahore for organizing a road run to protest the government's ban on women taking part in marathons alongside men. The activist, Asma Jehangir, a former head of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, was detained before the run along with 30 other participants, including Iqbal Haider, an opposition politician from the Pakistan People's Party of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. They were released after being held in a police station for several hours. The detentions drew strong criticism from civil society and human rights activists. A joint press release in Islamabad, the capital, by several peace organizations and activist groups condemned them as ''an unwarranted act against the right to press for demands of equality and justice for Pakistani women.'' Pakistani authorities had banned women from taking part in marathons last month after violent protests by hard-line Islamic parties. A marathon in Gujranwala, 85 miles south of Islamabad, in early April was attacked by a mob of Islamic extremists wielding batons and guns. Cross-fire between the police and the Islamists left 80 people injured. The organizers of the run on Saturday said they wanted to highlight violence against women and protest against the increasing influence of Islamic extremist political parties. Their gesture met with disapproval from law enforcement authorities, who turned down a request for permission to stage the run and pressed the organizers to cancel it. The organizers pledged to go ahead. The run was scheduled to start at 5 p.m., but police officials surrounded Ms. Jehangir's office before then and detained her along with other participants. They were whisked away in a police van and locked up in a police station, local news media reported. The run was canceled because of the arrests. Islamic extremists have been emboldened after recent retreats by the government, including its reversal of a decision to eliminate a column in Pakistani passports that specifies the holder's religion.",2005,"Pakistan"
"100","Pakistani Leader's Comments on Rape Stir Outrage","Asia","President Pervez Musharraf's offhand remark about women and rape, made in an interview in New York last week, was apparently intended to polish his country's image. Instead, it has ignited a firestorm of outrage at home and abroad and undermined his efforts to publicize his new governing principle of ''enlightened moderation.'' In an interview with The Washington Post, General Musharraf suggested that Pakistani women were making false or exaggerated claims of rape as a way of procuring financial support and visas from foreigners. ''You must understand the environment in Pakistan,'' he was quoted as saying. ''This has become a moneymaking concern. A lot of people say, 'If you want to go abroad and get a visa for Canada or citizenship and be a millionaire, get yourself raped.''' In response to the ensuing outcry, he first said he was merely summarizing the sentiments of some of his compatriots, and not necessarily expressing his own opinion. Then he denied making the remark at all. The Washington Post followed with a statement standing by its article. General Musharraf's comments reflected the frustration in the government over two prominent rape cases, which have deflected attention from things like a booming economy or Pakistan's role in the fight against Islamic militants, which the government would prefer to emphasize. The first concerned Mukhtar Mai, a woman from a small town in Punjab Province who said she was raped at the orders of a village jury in 2002. The men accused in the case have been released on bail and arrested several times, and her legal battle continues in the Supreme Court. Then there was the reported rape of Shazia Khalid, a physician attacked inside a government hospital quarters in Baluchistan Province early this year. The rapist has not been arrested, and Dr. Khalid says she received threats that forced her to leave Pakistan. The government has been at loggerheads with human rights groups ever since. Ms. Mukhtar, who has continued to press for her attackers to be punished, has become an international celebrity. Dr. Khalid has moved to Britain. ''The entire justice system has failed,'' said Farzana Bari, a human rights activist in Islamabad. ''Suddenly such cases have exposed the nature of the state.'' General Musharraf sought to impose travel restrictions on Ms. Mukhtar earlier this year. ''She was told not to go,'' he said at the time. ''I don't want to project the bad image of Pakistan.'' The travel restrictions were lifted in June under pressure from Washington. A government-sponsored conference ''violence against women'' this month ended in controversy when the general criticized nongovernmental organizations for maligning Pakistan and stressed that Pakistan should not be singled out for its record on violence against women, saying it is a global problem. Advocates for rape victims note that the recalcitrance of law enforcement officials sometimes stems from their own involvement in rape. In one high-profile case, Sonia Naz, 23, alleged that a senior police official had raped her in Faisalabad; she had been was arrested four months earlier for entering the Parliament building without permission. In May, several police officers at an Islamabad police station were suspended on allegations of raping a 15-year-old girl named Saira. In the tug of war between the human rights activists and the government, General Musharraf's political opponents have jumped into the fray. A former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party who lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai and London, expressed her ''profound shock'' over the way Ms. Naz's case has been handled. Last week, a leader of Ms. Bhutto's party presented a check worth about $1 million to Ms. Mukhtar, saying, ''Government should help, not malign rape victims.'' General Musharraf would be paying a stiffer political price, political experts here say, if he were an elected official. He has worked hard to position himself as an enlightened leader despite coming to power in a coup, and the rape issue threatens to sabotage that effort. ''What has enraged most Pakistani women, as well as public opinion, is governmental and judicial apathy and the attempt by people at the highest level to hush these cases,'' wrote S.M. Naseem, a columnist in Dawn, the country's most prestigious daily. ''When such attempts are exposed, the government's first reaction is to pretend to be puzzled, then to deny its involvement and claim it has been misquoted or misinterpreted, and finally to denounce these critics as unpatriotic and having agendas.''

"101","Scandals Force Out Japanese TV Chief; Critics Say Network Bowed to Pressure to Soften Controversial WWII Program","Asia","-- The president of NHK, Japan's public television network, resigned Tuesday following a series of scandals, including allegations that top politicians had pressured the network to censor a program about the use of sex slaves by Japanese troops during World War II. Katsuji Ebisawa, 70, president of the network, one of the world's largest, had been under pressure following a string of embezzlement scandals in which one person was arrested for fraud and 12 others were internally disciplined. The pressure mounted after several articles in Japan's Asahi newspaper this month alleged that politicians close to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi had used their influence to soften a provocative documentary on ""comfort women,"" mostly Koreans, Chinese and Indonesians, who were taken into bondage by Japan's former Imperial Army. Both Ebisawa -- who linked his resignation to a broader lack of public confidence in the network -- and the politicians involved have strongly denied the charges. But the allegations have nevertheless rekindled ongoing controversy over the playing down of Japan's war crimes. In a teary-eyed confession two weeks ago, an NHK producer conceded that political interference had led to key footage being removed from the documentary, which was aired four years ago. Survivors among the women charged that their harrowing testimony was purposely edited out, while air time was given to a scholar who claimed that most of them had been willing prostitutes. After the program was broadcast, a Japan-based women's rights group filed a defamation lawsuit. Critics say the accusations are evidence of a growing strain of revisionism in Japan, where influential politicians have sought to whitewash the nation's past war crimes. ""The alteration of the NHK program is not just a problem of the Japanese media,"" said Rumiko Nishino, chairwoman of Violence Against Women in War Network, Japan, which is suing NHK over the program. ""It is part of a political movement to revise history and deny what Japan did in the past."" World War II is a constant source of anxiety in Japan, along with patriotism and the role of the military during the war and now. Leading lawmakers, spurred in part by the threat of a nuclear-armed North Korea, are advocating the alteration of Japan's U.S.-drafted constitution, which renounces the right to wage war. Japan has already dispatched noncombat troops to Iraq in its largest military-related operation since World War II. Many characterize the changes as part of Japan's overdue reemergence onto the world stage as it seeks a global role commensurate with its enormous wealth. But others -- particularly Asian neighbors with harsh memories of the war -- are troubled by what they view as an accompanying trend to defend Japan's wartime ambitions. The latest allegations of political interference concerned the tens of thousands of women taken into bondage during World War II, whose history was explored in one in a four-part series addressing the issue of international war crimes. The charges against NHK, which holds a place in Japan comparable to the BBC's in Britain, have affected its reputation. Many critics are charging NHK with kowtowing to Japan's conservative ruling party. ""This has revealed the politics of yes men that exists at NHK,"" said Keiichi Katsura, professor of journalism at Taisho University in Tokyo. ""It shows that NHK is beholden to LDP politicians rather than to its viewers,"" he said, referring to the governing Liberal Democratic Party. Even before Ebisawa's resignation, public anger at the network was mounting, with more than 100,000 viewers withholding their subscription fees in protest. Ebisawa admitted Tuesday that the number of viewers who had stopped paying the fees was growing and could reach half a million by March. As a result, NHK is cutting executive salaries by as much as 15 percent. Ebisawa's departure was expected to ease criticism, but analysts said questions would linger about the network's ties to the Liberal Democrats. ""NHK is facing an unprecedented crisis,"" said Yasushi Kawasaki, an academic and former NHK political editor. ""And the exit of Ebisawa is not going to easily fix it."" NHK's president is named by a board of governors appointed by the prime minister and approved by parliament, but the network says that it is editorially independent of the government. NHK has denied giving in to political pressure over the content of the 2001 program and has said that the accounts of the network's own producer, who spoke out last week, as well as the reports in the Asahi newspaper include ""numerous inaccuracies."" An NHK spokesman, who declined to be named citing the company's corporate policy, said that the significant last-minute edits of the comfort women program were intended to provide journalistic balance. Footage of an elderly female survivor and a former Japanese soldier giving testimony at a mock trial held in Tokyo, for instance, were cut because there were ""no facts to prove their stories,"" the spokesman said. In the accompanying interview, the academic's comments were added ""in the interest of being neutral and fair."" Many Chinese and Koreans insist that Japan has never fully atoned for its wartime actions. The allegations of high-level pressure to blunt the accounts of the comfort women have reignited the debate. ""The truth about Japanese politicians has been revealed through this NHK scandal,"" said Kang Chang Il, a congressman from South Korea's ruling Uri Party. Special correspondent Sachiko Sakamaki in Tokyo contributed to this report.",2005,"Japan"
"102","In Disgrace, And Facing Death","Asia","Aisha Parveen will live another day. Indeed, at least another week. Ms. Parveen, the young Pashtun woman I wrote about on Sunday, was kidnapped at the age of 14 and imprisoned in a brothel here in southeastern Pakistan for six years. She escaped in January and married the man who helped her flee, but now a Pakistani court has charged her with adultery and is threatening to hand her back to the brothel owner -- even though she is adamant that he will then torture and kill her. Ms. Parveen's court hearing was yesterday, and I was afraid that would be the end. But the court adjourned the case for one week for further investigation. And Ms. Parveen's lawyer thinks the mood is different now: the Pakistani press picked up on my column, and the attention will make judges more careful about handling her. So the publicity may save her life, but it won't make much difference for thousands of other Aisha Parveens around the world. Asma Jahangir, the chairwoman of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said she sees cases like Ms. Parveen's all the time. ''There is no such thing called justice in Pakistan,'' said Ms. Jahangir, a prominent lawyer in Lahore. ''It has simply collapsed.'' Ms. Jahangir fights heroically for poor women who have been charged -- like Ms. Parveen -- with zina offenses under Islamic law. Zina encompasses fornication and adultery, and accusations of zina are effective weapons against women. Landlords often evict women tenants, for example, by accusing them of zina. Worse, women who go to the police to report rapes can be arrested for zina, because they have acknowledged illicit sex and yet usually cannot provide four male witnesses to prove that it was rape. Even professionals like Ms. Jahangir are targeted if they confront the government. Last year, for example, the police attacked her and a group of other middle-class women demonstrating for women's rights. She says that an aide to President Pervez Musharraf gave the police instructions about her: ''Teach the [expletive] a lesson. Strip her in public.'' Sure enough, the police ripped off her shirt. Ms. Parveen, now living in hiding after several kidnapping attempts in the last few days, faces an even more brutal struggle. Her only stroke of luck is having her new husband, Mohamed Akram, who rescued her from the brothel, on her side. The young couple are lovebirds, and each keeps talking about being so lucky to have found the other. But Mr. Akram, while unwavering in his love, has disgraced his family by marrying a supposedly fallen woman, and his older sister is suffering. ''My brother-in-law sent me a message: 'Unless you divorce her, I will divorce your sister,' '' Mr. Akram lamented. ''She has two kids. And he's also beating her now. He's very upset because I married a girl who was in a brothel, who is not a virgin.'' The couple cannot seek refuge with Ms. Parveen's parents, because Pashtun parents routinely protect their family honor by killing daughters accused of zina. ''I cannot go back there because if I do, they'll kill me,'' Ms. Parveen said. ''In their eyes I'm dishonored, because even if a girl is kidnapped, then in their eyes she still should be killed.'' Saddest of all, her story isn't newsworthy in a classic sense. There's nothing at all unusual about a young Asian woman suffering years of sexual enslavement, or judicial malpractice or murder. And that's the challenge for us all, Asians and Americans alike -- to change our worldview and put gender issues like sex trafficking higher on the global agenda. A quarter-century ago, Jimmy Carter plucked human rights abuses from the backdrop of the international arena and put them on the agenda. Now it's time to focus on gender inequality in the developing world, for that is the greatest single source of human rights violations today. Political dissidents tend to get the world's attention. But for every dissident who is beaten to death by government torturers somewhere in the world, thousands of ordinary women or girls die prematurely because of the effects of discrimination. In India, for example, girls 1 to 5 years old are 50 percent more likely to die than boys of the same age, because the boys are favored. That differential accounts for the death of a young Indian girl every four minutes. Since these victims usually are voiceless, I'll give Ms. Parveen the last word so she can prick our consciences. ''God should not give daughters to poor people,'' she said in despair. ''And if a daughter is born, God should grant her death.''",2006,"Pakistan"
"103","Spread of Islamic Law in Indonesia Takes Toll on Women","Asia","To a passer-by, the dress and demeanor of Lilis Lindawati would have attracted little attention as she waited in the dark in this busy industrial city for a ride home. She wore green pants, a denim jacket, beige sandals with modest heels, burgundy lipstick and penciled eyebrows. Her black hair flowed freely, unencumbered by a head scarf, the sign of a religious Muslim woman that is increasingly prevalent in Indonesia but not mandatory. In a now widely recounted incident, Mrs. Lindawati, 36, was hustled into a government van that clammy February evening by brown-uniformed police, known as tranquillity and public order officers. ''They put about 20 of us in the police station and then went out again to target the hotels,'' she said, telling the story as she sat on the floor of her family's two-room, $12-a-month rental, her husband beside her. She was charged with being a prostitute under a new local law forbidding lewd behavior, and in an unusual public hearing attended by local dignitaries and residents, she was sentenced with some of the other women to three days in jail. Mrs. Lindawati insists she is not a prostitute. Her case has become a symbol of an increasingly impassioned tussle in Indonesia between those who favor the introduction of Shariah, or Islamic law -- sometimes called Islamic-like laws -- by local governments, and those that assert that this large Muslim country, recognized for its moderation and diversity, must hold firm to its secular Constitution of 1945. Nearly 30 local governments have introduced Shariah laws or Shariah-inspired legislation, from Aceh in the far north where Shariah laws have lain quiescent on the books for several years but are now being carried out by special Shariah courts, to southern Sulawesi and to small islands farther west. In Aceh, the province devastated by the tsunami, officers belonging to a special Shariah police unit stop women on the street who do not have their head scarves properly adjusted and often impose fines. In some instances, women have been publicly whipped for being caught in public with men who are not their husbands, said Suraiya Kamaruzzaman, a founder of Flower Aceh, a women's rights group. In Sulawesi, one of Indonesia's main islands, three southern districts have passed Shariah legislation and are establishing Shariah courts to enforce the laws. Schoolgirls have been sent home for wearing clothes considered insufficiently modest. In some places, women who are government officials must wear a head scarf to work. To many, the new laws represent stealthy movement toward excessive intrusion of Islam into Indonesia's political process, often with the backing of the Justice and Prosperity Party, a fast-rising Islamic party. Moderates are battling an anti-pornography bill, backed in the national Parliament by the Justice Party, that would impose a one-year prison sentence for women wearing miniskirts and five years for couples caught kissing in public. In another incident that is interpreted as a sign of growing grass-roots intolerance, a convert to Islam was jailed in a municipality in east Java earlier this year for leading prayers in a national language rather than in Arabic. Some leading moderates say they worry that President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the first directly elected leader of Indonesia and to many the personification of a tolerant Islam, has been too slow to react. In a speech in early June, Mr. Yudhoyono revived the notion of a state ideology, known as Pancasila, which is generally seen as Indonesia's commitment to secular government and of unity in diversity. But Pancasila, created by Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, came into its own as an ideology under General Suharto, the long-ruling authoritarian leader who was toppled in 1998. By the end of General Suharto's rule, Pancasila had fallen in esteem, too, leaving some moderates wondering whether the doctrine remained the best vehicle for reining in the new trend. ''It was a good speech reaffirming Pancasila and condemning Shariah,'' said T. Mulya Lubis, a prominent lawyer and chairman of the Society for Democracy and Education, ''but it was not enough.'' More than 50 members of Parliament recently signed a letter urging the president to abolish the Shariah-inspired local laws. The president, Mr. Lubis said, is overly concerned about offending some of the Islamic parties, particularly the Justice and Prosperity Party, which has supported him in Parliament. ''The president believes his persona alone can defeat the Islamists'' but that wasn't necessarily the case, the lawyer said. Mr. Lubis said he planned to take a roadshow of speakers to universities and schools across the country in the coming months to emphasize the moderate traditions of Indonesia. Not all of the new local laws are enforced by special Islamic courts. The mayor of Tangerang, Wahidin Halim, who initiated the regulation under which Mrs. Lindawati was charged, said he is trying to clean up public morals, not impose Islam. The Tangerang law that came into force last November banned passionate hugging or kissing, and bans the sale or consumption of alcohol except in upscale hotels. One result, many women say, is that they must be off the streets by dusk. ''The idea is to develop good morality, good behavior, to be a more civilized society,'' Mr. Wahidin said in an interview in his home garden. ''The Islamic parties love my programs, but that doesn't mean we have the same ideology.'' Supporters of Mrs. Lindawati are fighting her case on the legal, not ideological or religious grounds. Like most of the new local laws that are intended to govern people's personal behavior, the Tangerang regulation is unconstitutional, said Dedi Ali Ahmad, chairman of the Indonesian Legal and Aid and Human Rights Association in Jakarta. ''Charging someone on the suspicion of prostitution is not enough under the national law,'' he said. ''You cannot arrest someone for just being in a vicinity. They have to have attempted a crime.'' The Legal Aid Association was seeking a judicial review of the Tangerang regulation in the Supreme Court, Mr. Dedi said. At the same time, Mrs. Lindawati has filed a defamation suit against the mayor. In the suit, Mrs. Lindawati contends she was on the street waiting for a bus after coming into the center of town to claim back wages from a restaurant where she worked as a waitress. She said she is so poor -- her husband holds a low-paying job as a gym teacher at an elementary school -- that she had sold her mobile phone just before her arrest to feed her two teenage children. ''I have done nothing wrong,'' she said.",2006,"Indonesia"
"104","Punished For Being Female","Asia","Bride burnings, honor killings, female infanticide, sex trafficking, mass rape as a weapon of war and many other hideous forms of violence against women are documented in a report released last month by the United Nations. The report, a compilation of many studies from around the world, should have been seen as the latest dispatch from that permanent world war -- the war against women all over the planet. Instead, the news media greeted its shocking contents with a collective yawn. The war analogy is not an overstatement. In many parts of the world, men beat, torture, rape and kill women with impunity. In Ciudad Juarez, a Mexican city on the Texas border, 300 to 400 women have been murdered over the past several years. Many were raped and mutilated. The widespread belief that punishment for these crimes was unlikely was a ''key factor'' in their occurrence, the report said. Each year thousands of wives in India are murdered and maimed -- many of them doused with kerosene and set ablaze -- by husbands dissatisfied by the size of their dowries or angry about their wives' behavior. In Ethiopia, the abduction and rape of young girls is a commonplace way to obtain a bride. In many instances the parents agree to the marriage, believing that the raped child is no longer fit to marry anyone else. In Pakistan, a woman cannot legally prove that she was raped unless four ''virtuous'' Muslim men testify that they witnessed the attack. Without those four witnesses, the woman herself is vulnerable to prosecution for fornication or adultery. While it's undoubtedly true that men maim and kill other men in astonishing numbers, what I'm talking about here is the way that women, by the millions, are systematically targeted for attack because  they are women. In some cases the sexual violence comes in vast, sickening waves. Just think, for example, of Darfur, Congo, Sudan and the former Yugoslavia. As the report noted, ''The incidence of violence against women in armed conflict, particularly sexual violence, including rape, has been increasingly acknowledged and documented.'' More than 130 million girls and women are living with the consequences of genital mutilation, and many others have died from this barbaric practice. Jessica Neuwirth, the president of Equality Now, an international women's rights organization, said, ''Everyone who's been cut knows someone who died from the cutting. They die from bleeding, or later from infection, or sometime later in life they have enormous health problems.'' The litany of serious abuses against women and girls can seem endless: child marriages, forced marriages, kidnapping and forced prostitution, sex slavery. According to the U.N. report, ''A study in India estimated that prenatal sex selection and infanticide have accounted for half a million missing girls per year for the past two decades.'' The most common form of serious abuse against women and girls around the globe is violence by intimate partners. Huge percentages of female murder victims, even in such developed countries as Australia, Canada, Israel and the United States, are killed by current or former husbands or boyfriends. A study of young, female murder victims in the U.S. found that homicide was the second leading cause of death for girls 15 to 18, and that 78 percent of all the homicide victims in the study had been killed by an acquaintance or intimate partner. The U.N. report tells us what we should already have concluded: that this pervasive violence against women, ''whether perpetrated by the state and its agents, or by family members or strangers, in the public or private sphere, in peacetime or in times of conflict,'' is unacceptable. Not only are we not doing enough to counter this wholesale destruction of the lives of so many women and girls, we're not even paying close attention. There are women's movements in even the smallest countries fighting against the violence and other forms of abuse. But they are underfunded and get very little support from those in a position to help. (Even in Afghanistan under the Taliban there were women who ran underground schools, and girls who risked their lives to go to them.) There was a time when activists cried out for our consciousness to be raised. It's not too late. We can start by recognizing that the systematic subordination and brutalization of women and girls around the world is, in fact, occurring -- and that we need to do something about it.",2006,"India"
"105","Japan's 'Atonement' to Former Sex Slaves Stirs Anger","Asia","Facing calls to compensate the aging victims of its wartime sexual slavery, Japan set up the Asian Women's Fund in 1995. It was a significant concession from Japan, which has always asserted that postwar treaties absolved it of all individual claims from World War II. But the fund only fueled anger in the very countries with which Japan had sought reconciliation. By the time it closed as scheduled last month, only a fraction of the former sex slaves had accepted its money. Two Asian governments even offered money to discourage more women from taking Japan's. Critics inside and outside Japan complained about the Japanese government's decision to set up the fund as a private one, making clear that the ''atonement'' payments came from citizens. They saw this as another tortured attempt by Tokyo to avoid taking full responsibility for one of the ugliest aspects of the war. ''It was not directly from the Japanese government; that is why I did not accept it,'' said Ellen van der Ploeg, 84, a Dutchwoman who was taken from a prisoner of war camp in Indonesia and forced to work in a Japanese military brothel for three months in 1944. ''If you have made mistakes in life, you must have the courage to say, 'I'm sorry, please forgive me.' But the Japanese government to this day has never taken full responsibility.'' ''If this were a pure government fund, I could have accepted it,'' Ms. van der Ploeg said in a telephone interview from Houten, the Netherlands. ''Why should I accept money from private Japanese people? They were also victims during the war.'' The Japanese government has held up the fund as one way it has tried to redress a past wrong, even as, in Washington, the House of Representatives is considering a resolution that would call on Japan's government to unequivocally acknowledge its role in the wartime sexual slavery, and apologize for it. Of those former sex slaves -- known euphemistically here as comfort women -- who accepted money from the fund, most did so secretly to avoid criticism. Supporters of the women in the four places where women were compensated individually -- South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and the Netherlands -- became deeply divided over whether to accept the money. Even those who favored accepting the money said the fund reflected the absence of moral clarity in Japan, an opinion that was reinforced in March, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe denied the Japanese military's role in coercing women into sexual slavery. ''I believed the Japanese government should take direct legal responsibility, but I respected the wishes of the women who wanted to accept the money,'' said Marguerite Hamer, the head of a private Dutch organization, the Project Implementation Committee in the Netherlands, through which 79 women have received compensation from the Asian Women's Fund. ''They are old, and they had such hard lives. ''I was furious and astounded by Abe's denial,'' Ms. Hamer added. ''It was really awful for the women. Four of them called me and said, 'How could this happen again? How could they do this to me again?' '' About $4.8 million was raised for the fund from private contributions. From that sum, 285 women in South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines received almost $17,000 each, along with a letter of apology from the Japanese prime minister. The Japanese government stressed that the ''atonement money'' did not come from the government, in keeping with its position that postwar treaties cleared it of such claims. It also feared, experts said, that making any exceptions would leave it vulnerable to lawsuits from other victims of Japanese militarism. The government provided $6.3 million in ''welfare services'' to the 285 women, as well as the 79 in the Netherlands. This money was also part of the Asian Women's Fund. In reality, though, the women were free to use this government money however they wished. There was little practical difference, but a big symbolic one, between atonement and welfare. ''The Japanese government has presented this fund to deceive our survivors and the international community,'' said Nelia Sancho, a leading supporter of the women in the Philippines. As a result of the hairsplitting, the governments of Taiwan and South Korea, two former Japanese colonies, rejected both payment programs of the Asian Women's Fund and created their own. Former sex slaves there were pressed to reject the Japanese money, though supporters acknowledge that some secretly accepted both. Haruki Wada, the executive director of the Asian Women's Fund and a historian at the University of Tokyo, defended the program, noting that it was Japan's first attempt since the end of World War II to compensate its war victims individually. He acknowledged that the nature of the payments was sometimes confusing. ''The Dutch took it as compensation, but for the Japanese government, it wasn't compensation,'' Mr. Wada said. ''In theory, the payments were for the costs of the welfare services. It was a quintessentially Japanese way of doing things.'' He added, ''It doesn't matter if there's criticism that the fund was inadequate or that Japan should have done more. But to tell the victims that they can't take this money only made them suffer.'' Mr. Wada said fund officials were unable to operate and reach survivors in other countries, including China, North Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar and East Timor. Because of the official opposition in South Korea and Taiwan, officials associated with the Japanese fund often had to contact former sex slaves outside official channels. Wu Huiling, an official at the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation -- the private organization that has been entrusted by the Taiwanese government to offer services to former sex slaves -- said fund officials sometimes came knocking, unannounced, at the women's homes. ''The grandmas were surprised,'' Ms. Wu said. ''At first, they thought the strangers were con men, but they were only men from the Asian Women's Fund offering them money.'' Because of the delicateness of the issue, officials at the Japanese fund have refused to break down the 285 recipients by nationality. ''This fund is closing without our being able to even announce how many accepted the fund in South Korea and Taiwan,'' Mr. Wada said. Indeed, the opposition was fiercest in South Korea. In a shelter for former sex slaves outside Seoul, Yi Ok-seon, 80, said the fund was an attempt by the Japanese government ''to shut the mouths of the comfort women.'' Between 1942 and 1945, starting at age 16, another Korean woman, Lee Yong-nyeo, 81, was forced to work in a military brothel in Burma, now Myanmar. She was one of the few in South Korea to admit taking money from the fund. ''I lived in someone else's house since I was 8, and I wanted to buy land,'' said Mrs. Lee, in an interview inside the new house she bought with money from the fund. ''I resisted for many years,'' she added. ''But I didn't know whether I would ever get anything, so when the Japanese called a few years ago and said this might be the last chance, I decided to accept it.'' In the Philippines, the government offered no domestic assistance to the women and avoided criticizing Japan, by far its largest donor. ''The Filipino government is so dependent on Japanese aid that it cannot rock the boat,'' said Ricardo Trota Jose, a historian of Philippine-Japanese relations at the University of the Philippines.",2007,"Japan"
"106","China Places AIDS Activist Under House Arrest","Asia","A retired Chinese doctor acclaimed for helping people with AIDS has been placed under house arrest to stop her from traveling to the United States to receive an award from a nonprofit group connected to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a friend of the doctor said Monday. The doctor, Gao Yaojie, has been confined to her apartment in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou since Feb. 1, according to her friend, Hu Jia, himself a well-known advocate for people with AIDS. Friends and family members who have tried to visit Dr. Gao have found police officers outside her apartment, Mr. Hu said. Dr. Gao, 79, is apparently being confined alone. ''Now, her phone is cut off,'' said Mr. Hu, who has spoken to Dr. Gao's relatives. ''She can't even call out for help if something goes wrong.'' Dr. Gao was notified in October that she would be honored by the Vital Voices Global Partnership, a nonprofit women's advocacy group. She is one of four Chinese women being recognized at a March 14 ceremony in Washington, which will also honor women from India, Guatemala and Sudan. Mrs. Clinton, a New York Democrat, is an honorary co-chairwoman of the group, along with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. Wenchi Yu Perkins, director of the group's human rights program, said friends and acquaintances of Dr. Gao notified her on Monday of the house arrest. Ms. Perkins said she was surprised because Vital Voices had consulted with Chinese officials, including officials at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, about honoring Dr. Gao. No one had raised any objections, she said. ''We hope this is a misunderstanding,'' she added. Dr. Gao was supposed to fly to Beijing on Sunday for a Monday appointment at the United States Embassy to process a visa to travel to Washington. But Susan Stevenson, a spokeswoman at the embassy, said Dr. Gao missed her appointment. ''We have raised Dr. Gao's case with China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs,'' Ms. Stevenson said. Dr. Gao gained international attention after she helped expose a blood-selling program in central China that infected tens of thousands of farmers with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, during the 1990s. She spent years traveling to villages in her native Henan Province, handing out information about AIDS, helping orphans and dispensing medicine. She is among a handful of advocates whose work is credited with helping to force the Chinese government to confront the spread of H.I.V. Her work has also made her a marked woman, at times. Until a few years ago, security agents from Henan often followed her. In past interviews, she said she assumed that her telephone was tapped. In 2001, she was not allowed to travel to Washington to receive an international award for her work on AIDS. More recently, though, the pressure had eased, a shift that coincided with more open central government attitudes toward AIDS. She has been allowed to speak at medical conferences and has been regularly profiled in the Chinese news media. But Henan officials apparently did not want her to attend a prominent event like the one in Washington. ''They tried to persuade her not to go to America and meet Hillary Clinton,'' Mr. Hu said. ''She refused, and then the police appeared.'' A spokesman for the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau declined to comment. A Henan provincial spokesman said, ''I don't know about this.''",2007,"China"
"107","China Relents, Allowing AIDS Doctor to Visit U.S.","Asia","China gave in to international pressure on Friday and agreed to release a prominent AIDS doctor from house arrest so she can attend an awards ceremony in Washington next month. ''We're just really excited about it,'' said Wenchi Yu Perkins, an officer with Vital Voices Global Partnership, a nonprofit women's advocacy group that will honor the doctor, Gao Yaojie, in March along with other women from around the world. ''I just talked to Dr. Gao,'' Ms. Perkins added. ''She confirmed that last night an official visited and informed her that they would respect her wish to come to the U.S. I think that is the best gift for her for the Chinese New Year.'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, an honorary co-chairwoman of Vital Voices, announced China's decision on Friday after receiving the news from the Chinese ambassador in Washington. Mrs. Clinton said in a statement that she was ''delighted'' and that she had been assured that Dr. Gao would ''be allowed to travel freely to the United States.'' Dr. Gao, 80, has been kept under house arrest since Feb. 1 in the central China city of Zhengzhou in Henan Province. Authorities detained her to stop her from traveling to apply for a travel visa , friends and AIDS advocates said. Dr. Gao is famously outspoken, and although China has taken a more open approach toward AIDS in recent years, officials were apparently worried she might say something provocative or embarrassing in Washington. She gained international attention for her work helping to expose the government-sponsored blood-selling operations that caused thousands of farmers to be infected with H.I.V. during the 1990s. Dr. Gao's detention had attracted international attention and brought pressure on the Chinese government. On Tuesday, a provincial newspaper, Henan Daily, published a photograph and article detailing how provincial officials had visited Dr. Gao to wish her ''sincere greetings'' for the upcoming Lunar New Year. Many AIDS advocates saw the photograph and assumed it meant that China had released her. But, in fact, she was still under house arrest. Dr. Gao could not be reached for comment on Saturday morning.",2007,"China"

"110","From Stand in Long Island Slavery Case, a Snapshot of a Hidden U.S. Problem","Asia","The two tiny Indonesian women know just a handful of English words. They know Windex. Fantastik (the cleanser, not the adjective). They know the words Master and Missus, which they were taught to use in addressing the Long Island couple they served as live-in help for five years in the sylvan North Shore hamlet of Muttontown. Their employers, Varsha Sabhnani, 35, and her husband, Mahender, 51, naturalized citizens from India, have been on trial in U.S. District Court here for the past month. They are charged with what the federal criminal statutes refer to as involuntary servitude and peonage, or, in the common national parlance since 1865, the crime of keeping slaves. The two women, the government charged in its indictment, were victims of ''modern-day slavery.'' It is a rarely prosecuted crime. But since passage of the 2000 federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act, prosecutions have increased from less than a handful nationwide per year to about a dozen. The law is probably best known for its focus on prostitution and child-sex traffickers; yet in the last few years, in a few highly publicized cases like the Sabhnanis', federal and state task forces set up to deal with sex trafficking have also begun to focus on the exploitation of domestic workers. Last year, the wife of a Saudi prince was convicted in Boston for keeping two house servants for three years in virtual slavery. In 2005, two doctors in Wisconsin were convicted of holding a Philippine woman as an indentured servant for 20 years. Federal prosecutors won convictions in 2003 against a Maryland couple who kept a Brazilian woman in their home as a servant for 15 years, paying her nothing. In the Long Island case, prosecutors say the two Indonesian women were made to sleep in closets of the sprawling, multimillion-dollar home of their employers. They were forced to work day and night, threatened, tortured, beaten with rolling pins and brooms, deprived of adequate food and never allowed out of the house except to take out the garbage. The defense lawyers, who are scheduled to begin their case on Monday, have characterized the two women as liars, practitioners of witchcraft, and inventors of a false claim designed to win them fast-track advantages that federal immigration law grants certain victims of torture and abuse. Whatever injuries the women may have suffered, the lawyers said, were self-inflicted in the practice of a traditional Indonesian folk cure known as kerokan. Advocacy groups, prosecutors and researchers who study labor trafficking say domestic workers are as vulnerable to exploitation as sex workers, and in some ways even harder to reach. ''The domestic servant cases are often the most brutal because of the total isolation in which these women are kept for years and years,'' said Cathleen Caron, executive director of Global Workers Justice Alliance, a New York-based advocacy group that provides legal help to exploited migrant workers. She has been watching the Sabhnani case with interest, she said. The Indonesian women in the Long Island case are identified by the government only by their first names, Samirah and Enung. They are 51 and 47 years old, respectively. Each stands less than five feet tall. In their many hours of translated testimony and cross-examination so far, halted occasionally by fits of sobbing, they have told a grim tale at odds with every notion of modern life in the United States. The Sabhnanis, who are perfume manufacturers with relatives and business contacts in Indonesia, lured them from their jobs and families in Jakarta in 2002 with false promises, they say, and then subjected them to relentless abuse until Samirah ran away in May. Regardless of the jury's verdict, the case has raised the profile of a population, mostly of women, hidden in the folds of some very affluent American households, according to advocates for exploited workers. Claudia Flores, a staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who recently represented three Indian women kept in involuntary servitude by foreign diplomats in Washington, said foreign workers unfamiliar with American culture and language, already vulnerable, are pushed beyond the pale by isolation. ''Many times, they are forbidden to talk to people who come into the house,'' Ms. Flores said. ''If there are two of them, they are often forbidden to talk to each other. Their phone calls are monitored. They are not allowed to go anywhere unaccompanied. We are only seeing the women who are lucky enough and capable enough to find assistance. What we see is really only the tip of the iceberg.'' A report released in July by the federal State Department, ''Pursuing a Dream and Finding a Nightmare,'' said the exploitation of women as domestic workers in the United States and abroad was a crime that has ''largely gone unpunished for too long.'' The report, written by research staff in the department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, underlined the government's concern for ''unskilled women from developing countries, particularly women working as domestics,'' who it said often ''fall victim to conditions of servitude in developed destination countries, including the United States.'' Jodi Bobb, a U.S. Justice Department spokeswoman, said the Long Island slavery case was one of about 100 prosecutions for involuntary servitude or labor trafficking since passage of the 2000 anti-trafficking law. Not all of them involved domestic workers, she said, but that number represents a two-fold increase in such prosecutions compared with the seven years before 2000. The number of migrant domestic servants living in involuntary servitude in the United States is a matter for guessing, but there are some well-informed guesses. The State Department report estimated that the total number of people trafficked to the United States annually was 15,000 to 20,000. The figures do not distinguish between people trafficked for prostitution or factory, farm or domestic work. But advocates including Ms. Flores and Ms. Caron, based on hundreds of cases that filter through their agencies, estimated that domestic workers accounted for about one-third of the total. In other words, 5,000 to 7,000 migrant domestic servants take jobs each year in homes where they are highly vulnerable to abuse by their employers, they say. Whether or not they live in conditions as violent as Samirah and Enung claim to have suffered, almost all are uneducated women from the world's poorest countries, according to the State Department report. Some are children. They may sign employment contracts promising wages that seem princely in their home countries -- Samirah and Enung agreed to $100 a month, for instance -- but which severely limit their options here. The temporary visas they obtain with their new employers' help usually expire after three to six months, giving employers ammunition to threaten the servants with certain arrest if they leave the house. ''Who would do this to another human being?'' said Suzanne Tomatore, director of the Immigrant Women and Children Project of the New York City Bar Association, which has assisted dozens of migrant domestic servants. ''All kinds of people. Doctors, lawyers, professionals, business people, diplomats -- the only thing the employers have in common as a group is they all have the resources to pay someone a fair wage, but they choose not to.'' Ms. Tomatore said prosecutions were difficult for obvious reasons: language and cultural barriers. Fear. In many cases, depression. One of her clients, a 24-year-old woman, had been a domestic servant in one household since she was 6. ''She had never been to school,'' said Ms. Tomatore, who would not identify the woman or the employers except to say they were diplomats from an African nation who have since left. The woman was given permanent legal immigration status. She works in an office. During the Long Island trial, sobbing sometimes overtook Samirah as she described the tortures she was subjected to -- being forced to run up and down stairs until exhausted, to eat whole hot chili peppers, to stand still while ''the Missus'' scalded her with boiling hot water. Sometimes the sobbing overtook Enung, who described being forced to help perform some of those tortures on Samirah. The case is unusual, advocates say, because there were other witnesses to corroborate some of the women's claims. Among them was a woman who worked for Mr. Sabhnani's perfume company, which is based in an office attached to the Muttontown house. She said she was shocked one day to see Samirah crawling up the basement stairs, bleeding from the forehead. The woman testified that Samirah and Enung told her that Mrs. Sabhnani had beaten her. A landscape contractor testified that Enung approached him furtively one morning, raggedly dressed, pointing to her stomach and uttering one of her few English words: ''Doughnut,'' he recalled her saying. ''Doughnut.'' He gave her the half-dozen doughnuts he had in his truck. ''Thank you, thank you, thank you,'' she cried as she ran back toward the big house, he said.",2007,"India"
"111","Pakistan Begins Inquiry Into Deaths of 5 Women Amid Dispute Over Honor Killings","Asia","The Pakistani government's inquiry into the deaths of five women buried alive in so-called honor killings in the southwestern Baluchistan Province is taking place against a backdrop of widespread protests and a dispute over a politician's defense of the practice. News of the killings, which occurred six weeks ago, trickled out of the remote, tribal area slowly and with sketchy details. As described in an Aug. 21 statement by a French human rights group, the victims were three young women who had planned to marry men of their choice -- a blot on family honor -- and two older female relatives. All were kidnapped by several men on July 13 from their village, Baba Kot, in the department of Jafferabad, and taken to a deserted area in a vehicle bearing provincial government plates, according to the group, the International Federation for Human Rights. The young women were beaten and shot, and, still breathing, covered with earth and stones. The two older women tried to intervene and were buried alive as well. The rights group said it based its account on information collected by an affiliated group, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. The Pakistani group is an independent nonprofit organization based in Lahore. One of the men involved, according to the rights group's account, was a brother of Baluchistan's housing minister, a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party. The case ignited widespread protests last week after an opposition senator, Yasmeen Shah, accused the government of turning a blind eye to the killings and then trying to cover them up. She was interrupted by a Baluchistan senator, Israr Ullah Zehri, who defended honor killings as ''our norms'' and said they should ''not be highlighted negatively.'' After widespread public uproar, the government moved to support a Senate resolution condemning the killings. Various critics said the Pakistan Peoples Party was trying to ignore the episode while trying to secure Baluchistan's support for the leader of the party, Asif Ali Zardari, in Saturday's electoral college vote for president. A senior Interior Ministry official, Rehman Malik, said Monday that he had ordered an inquiry that would be completed within a week, and that three people had already been arrested. In an interview, he denied the alleged link to the provincial minister and raised questions about descriptions of the case. ''I have my doubts it is honor killing,'' he said.  ''There is a dispute whether it was due to honor killing or dispute over land. Let the final report come.'' Each year, hundreds of women in Pakistan are killed in the name of honor, according to rights groups, but most cases go unreported or are not properly investigated. Honor killings were banned in 2004 on penalty of death, but as critics at the time warned, the new law was weak and proved ineffective. The practice remains rampant in rural areas rife with poverty and illiteracy and still dominated by feudal landlords and tribal leaders. ''The law against honor killing is not being implemented effectively even though it introduced capital punishment,'' said Nilofar Bakhtiar, a senator who had moved the legislation against honor killings as a minister for women's affairs under the government of Pervez Musharraf, who resigned on Aug. 18, opening the way for Saturday's election. Much remains unclear about the case, including what happened to the three men the young women had wanted to marry. ''It was very difficult to ascertain the facts and names as it is a very conservative area, deeply entrenched in tribal customs and traditions,'' said Farid Ahmed, the provincial coordinator of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, in a telephone interview from Quetta. The victims were identified as members of the Umrani tribe. ''People are not willing to talk openly not only out of fear but also because of their tribal beliefs,'' he said. ''Many accuse the women of having loose morals because they wanted to marry of their own choice.'' Outside the Parliament building on Monday, about 40 human rights activists shouted slogans condemning the killings and Mr. Zehri's defense of ''tradition.'' ''I was very shocked,'' Duskha Syed, who teaches at Quaid-i-Azam  University, said. ''I am in my 50s and I don't remember anything of this sort. We had heard of honor killings but the fact of burying people alive is unprecedented.'' ''And what is even more scandalous is that this guy Zehri rationalizes and defends it.'' Another protester, Nasim Zehra, a political analyst, said: ''There is absolute insensitivity to law and rule of law. The timing is such that the government is trying to seek votes for the presidential elections. Also, there is a conspiracy of silence between the tribes. The most repelling fact is that those who are there to legislate have shown the worst kind of indifference.''",2008,"Pakistan"
"112","Fires Are Big Killer of Indian Women","Asia","More than 100,000 young women were killed in fires in India in a single year, and many of those deaths were tied to domestic abuse, according to a study published Monday. Young Indian women are more than three times as likely as young men to be killed by fire, according to an article published on the Web site of The Lancet, a British medical journal. The victims were mainly 15 to 34 years old. Domestic abuse is a serious problem in India. Often, in disputes over dowries, women are doused with gasoline and set ablaze, and their deaths are reported as kitchen accidents. In the first study of its kind, using the most recent data available, American researchers analyzed death registrations, official questionnaires in rural areas and census figures to arrive at an estimate of 163,000 fire-related deaths in 2001, or 2 percent of all deaths -- six times the number reported by the police. More than 106,000 of those, or 65 percent, were of women. Women's rights activists have long accused the government of not doing enough to fight the problem. Indira Jaising, director of the Women's Rights Initiative of the Lawyers Collective in New Delhi, said the authorities paid the issue nothing more than lip service. ''They say that it's a crime and it's shameful, but it's not enough to say that,'' Ms. Jaising said, adding that the authorities must intervene earlier in dowry disputes and domestic abuse cases. ''Once the death takes place they are willing to investigate, but by then it's too late,'' she said. ''When women go to them with complaints when they're alive, those complaints should be taken seriously.'' Officials at the Ministry of Women and Child Development did not respond to requests for comment.",2009,"India"
"113","Video Showing Taliban Flogging a Woman, 17, Rattles Pakistan","Asia","The video shows a young woman held face down as a Taliban commander whips her repeatedly with a leather strap. ''Leave me for the moment -- you can beat me again later,'' she screams, pleading for a reprieve and writhing in pain. Paying no heed, the commander orders those holding her to tighten their grip and continues the public flogging. A large group of men quietly stands and watches in a circle around her. The woman in the video is a 17-year-old resident of Kabal, in the restive Swat region in northwestern Pakistan. The images, which have been broadcast repeatedly by private television news networks in Pakistan, have caused outrage here and set off bitter condemnation by rights activists and politicians. They have also raised questions once again about the government's decision to enter into a peace deal in February that effectively ceded Swat to the Taliban and allowed them to impose Islamic law. The two-minute video is the first known case of a public flogging of a woman in Swat. Apparently shot on a cellphone and widely circulated in the picturesque valley, it demonstrates vividly how the Taliban have used public displays of punishment to terrify and control the local population. It was not clear what the young woman was accused of. One account said she had stepped out of her house without being escorted by a male family member, according to Samar Minallah, a rights activist. Ms. Minallah said she distributed the video to local news outlets after it was sent to her by someone from Swat three days ago. Another account said a local Taliban commander had falsely accused the teenager of violating Islamic law after she refused to accept his marriage proposal. A Taliban spokesman defended the punishment to the Geo Television Network but said it should not have been done in public. Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister of North-West Frontier Province, where Swat is located, also tried to play down the flogging by claiming that the video was recorded in January, before the peace agreement. He called it an attempt to sabotage the peace agreement. Not many seemed willing to countenance the argument. ''This is absurd,'' Athar Minallah, a lawyer who campaigned for the restoration of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, said in a telephone interview. ''No one can give justification for such an act. These handful of people have taken the population hostage, and the government is trying to patronize them. If the state surrenders, what will happen next?'' Asma Jahangir, one of the country's leading rights activists, condemned the flogging as ''intolerable.'' ''This is an eye-opener,'' she said in a televised news briefing in Lahore. ''Terrorism has seeped into every corner of the country. It is time that every patriotic Pakistani should raise a voice against such atrocities.'' She said she would join other rights activists and citizens in a rally against terrorism on Saturday in Lahore, where militants stormed a police academy this week. ''It will be a peaceful march to show that the people of Lahore will not stay silent,'' she said. Jugnu Mohsin, a peace activist and publisher of Friday Times, the country's most popular weekly newspaper, blamed the military for allowing the Taliban to gain strength and giving the militants a free hand to commit such atrocities. Ms. Mohsin  said she had received threats from Islamic extremists. ''I know that the federal and provincial governments are innocent victims and bystanders,'' she said. ''The military has handed over the ownership and refuses to fight.'' In February, after 20 months of losing battles against the Taliban in Swat, the government and the military accepted a peace deal and the establishment of Islamic courts in the region. In return, Maulana Fazlullah, the leader of the Taliban in Swat, pledged to lay down the weapons and end the violence. Those who opposed the deal said it would strengthen the militants and give them time to regroup and tighten their control in Swat. The government said the agreement would end the violence. Hundreds of schools have been destroyed in Swat, several government officials beheaded and education of girls banned under the Taliban. Both President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani condemned the flogging and ordered an investigation. Taking notice of the video, Mr. Chaudhry formed  an eight-judge panel in the Supreme Court to examine the case, a news release by the Pakistani court said. The justice ordered the interior secretary to bring the young woman before the court on Monday. Sherry Rehman, the former information minister and a member of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, demanded immediate action by the government. ''Ignoring such acts of violence amounts to sanctioning impunity,'' Ms. Rehman said in a statement. ''The fire in the Swat Valley and our northern regions can engulf other parts of the country, if we do nothing to put it out.''",2009,"Pakistan"
"114","If This Isn't Slavery, What Is?","Asia","Barack Obama's presidency marks a triumph over the legacy of slavery, so it would be particularly meaningful if he led a new abolitionist movement against 21st-century slavery  -- like the trafficking of girls into brothels. Anyone who thinks it is hyperbole to describe sex trafficking as slavery should look at the maimed face of a teenage girl, Long Pross. Glance at Pross from her left, and she looks like a normal, fun-loving  girl, with a pretty face and a joyous smile. Then move around, and you see where her brothel owner gouged out her right eye. Yes, I know it's hard to read this. But it's infinitely more painful for Pross to recount the humiliations she suffered, yet she summoned the strength to do so -- and to appear in a video posted online with this column  -- because she wants people to understand how brutal sex trafficking can be. Pross was 13 and hadn't even had her first period when a young woman kidnapped her and sold her to a brothel in Phnom Penh. The brothel owner, a woman as is typical, beat Pross and tortured her with electric current until finally the girl acquiesced. She was kept locked deep inside the brothel, her hands tied behind her back at all times except when with customers. Brothel owners can charge large sums for sex with a virgin, and like many girls, Pross was painfully stitched up so she could be resold as a virgin. In all, the brothel owner sold her virginity four times. Pross paid savagely each time she let a potential customer slip away after looking her over. ''I was beaten every day, sometimes two or three times a day,'' she said, adding that she was sometimes also subjected to electric shocks twice in the same day. The business model of forced prostitution is remarkably similar from Pakistan to Vietnam  -- and, sometimes, in the United States as well. Pimps use violence, humiliation and narcotics to shatter girls' self-esteem and terrorize them into unquestioning, instantaneous obedience. One girl working with Pross was beaten to death after she tried to escape. The brothels figure that occasional losses to torture are more than made up by the increased productivity of the remaining inventory. After my last column, I heard from skeptical readers doubting that conditions are truly so abusive. It's true that prostitutes work voluntarily in many brothels in Cambodia and elsewhere. But there are also many brothels where teenage girls are slave laborers. Young girls and foreigners without legal papers are particularly vulnerable. In Thailand's brothels, for example, Thai girls usually work voluntarily, while Burmese and Cambodian girls are regularly imprisoned. The career trajectory is often for a girl in her early teens to be trafficked into prostitution by force, but eventually to resign herself and stay in the brothel even when she is given the freedom to leave. In my blog, www.nytimes.com/ontheground, I respond to the skeptics and offer some ideas for readers who want to help. Pross herself was never paid, and she had no right to insist on condoms (she has not yet been tested for HIV, because the results might be too much for her fragile emotional state). Twice she became pregnant and was subjected to crude abortions. The second abortion left Pross in great pain, and she pleaded with her owner for time to recuperate. ''I was begging, hanging on to her feet, and asking for rest,'' Pross remembered. ''She got mad.'' That's when the woman gouged out Pross's right eye with a piece of metal. At that point in telling her story, Pross broke down and we had to suspend the interview. Pross's eye grew infected and monstrous, spraying blood and pus on customers, she later recounted. The owner discarded her, and she is now recuperating with the help of Sina Vann, the young woman I wrote about in my last column. Sina was herself rescued by Somaly Mam, a trafficking survivor who started the Somaly Mam Foundation in Cambodia to fight sexual slavery. The foundation is working with Dr. Jim Gollogly of the Children's Surgical Center in Cambodia  to get Pross a glass eye. ''A year from now, she should look pretty good,'' said Dr. Gollogly, who is providing her with free medical care. So Somaly saved Sina, and now Sina is saving Pross. Someday, perhaps Pross will help another survivor, if the rest of us can help sustain them. The Obama administration will have a new tool to fight traffickers: the Wilberforce Act, just passed by Congress, which strengthens sanctions on countries that wink at sex slavery. Much will depend on whether Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton see trafficking as a priority. There would be powerful symbolism in an African-American president reminding the world that the war on slavery isn't yet over, and helping lead the 21st-century abolitionist movement.",2009,"Cambodia"

Jim Yardley recently reported in The Times on the case of Nirupama Pathak, a 22-year-old journalism graduate student from northern India who was found dead in her bedroom in April. Police arrested her mother on suspicion of murder; the family insisted Ms. Pathak had killed herself after confessing that she was pregnant. The legal process must move forward, but what is clear is that Ms. Pathak's family -- members of the Brahmin caste, the highest Hindu caste -- fiercely disapproved of her engagement to a young man she had met at school who was from a middle-upper caste. When she told her family of her plans to marry, The Times reported, she was accused of defiling her Hindu religion. Her family gave police conflicting stories about how Ms. Pathak died. First, it was said that she had died from electrocution. Then the claim was that she had hanged herself. The autopsy showed that she had suffocated. Responding to an apparent resurgence in ''honor killings,'' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh ordered a cabinet-level commission this month to consider tougher penalties in such cases. In June, India's Supreme Court asked seven states and the national government to report on what is being done to address the problem. Mr. Singh and the court need to follow through. Honor killings are widely reported in the Middle East and South Asia, but in recent years they also have taken place in Italy, Sweden, Brazil and Britain. According to Navi Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, there are 5,000 instances annually when women and girls are shot, stoned, burned, buried alive, strangled, smothered and knifed to death by fathers, brothers, sons, uncles, even mothers in the name of preserving family ''honor.'' Ms. Pillay has rejected arguments that such family violence is outside the conceptual framework of international human rights. There is a reason these religious and cultural beliefs are allowed to persist. Politicians don't have the courage to call it what it is: murder.",2010,"India"
"118","Rapes of Women Show Clash of Old and New India","Asia","GHAZIABAD, India -- The young lovers met at a secluded spot next to a field of wheat at the edge of this sprawling suburb of New Delhi, where the timeless India of mustard fields and bullock carts abuts the frantically rising apartment towers of the budding middle class. They went seeking solitude, but instead found themselves at the violent cusp of old India and new. There, according to the police, five drunken young men from a nearby farming village accosted the couple last month, beating the young man and gang-raping the woman. It was the latest in a series of brutal sexual assaults and gang rapes of women in India's booming capital and its sprawling suburbs. In each case there has been an explosive clash between the rapidly modernizing city and the embattled, conservative village culture upon which the capital increasingly encroaches. The victims are almost invariably young, educated working women who are enjoying freedom unknown even a decade ago. The accused are almost always young high school dropouts from surrounding villages, where women who work outside the home are often seen as lacking in virtue and therefore deserving of harassment and even rape. ''If these girls roam around openly like this, then the boys will make mistakes,'' the mother of two of those accused in the rape said in an interview, refusing to give her name. It is a deeply ingrained attitude that has made New Delhi, by almost any measure, the most dangerous large city in India for women. The rate of reported rape is nearly triple that of Mumbai, and 10 times as high as Kolkata, formerly Calcutta, according to government records. A survey completed last year by the government and several women's rights groups found that 80 percent of women had faced verbal harassment in Delhi and that almost a third had been physically harassed by men. Nearly half the women surveyed reported being stalked, a statistic grimly illustrated earlier this month when a student at Delhi University was shot in broad daylight by a man the police suspect was stalking her. The attackers often do not see their actions as crimes, the police said, and do not expect the women they attack to report them. ''They have no doubt that they will get away with it,'' said H. G. S. Dhaliwal, a deputy police commissioner in New Delhi who has investigated several such cases. India's economy is expected to grow 9 percent this year, and its extended boom has brought sweeping social change. The number of women in the workforce has roughly doubled in the past 15 years. Law enforcement officials say that the rate of violent crime against women has actually dropped in Delhi in the past four years, owing to more aggressive policing efforts, measures like women-only train cars and laws that require companies that employ women on late shifts to chauffeur them home. But a vast majority of crimes against women go unreported, the police and women's activists say. The clash between the increasingly cosmopolitan city and its traditional surroundings is worsening, they say. ''There is a lot of tension between the people who are traditional in their mind-set and the city that is changing so quickly,'' said Ranjana Kumari, a leading women's rights advocate. ''Men are not used to seeing so many women in the country occupying public spaces.'' In few places is that conflict as evident as here in Ghaziabad, which sits at the eastern edge of New Delhi, a metastasizing megacity. The farmland where the young couple met represents an invisible but indelible dividing line. There is no question to which side the young couple belonged. The man was an engineer at a high-tech company with a salary good enough to afford him a motorbike and a laptop computer. Their attackers lived in the village of Raispur, less than a mile from the tidy complex where the young man shared an apartment with his parents, but they belong to an altogether different India. None of them managed to graduate from high school. The narrow lanes of their sleepy village are redolent of cow dung; every home, it seems, has a few cattle or buffaloes, many of them living in pens within residents' houses. Unlike the growing ranks of professional women in the city on their doorstep, the women of Raispur live hemmed-in lives, covering their faces with shawls in front of strangers and seldom roaming beyond the village. Seema Chowdhury, 20, the sister of one of the accused men, graduated from high school. But when she tried to enroll in college to become a teacher, her brothers refused to allow it. Young women who wander too far face many dangers, they argued. ''I wanted to do something in my life,'' she said. ''But they thought it was not a good idea.'' In comparison, the young woman who was raped here had unimaginable freedom. She had a job as an accountant at a garment factory and her own cellphone and e-mail account. Using those, she carried on a secret romance with a young man she met online despite the fact that her parents had arranged for her to be married to someone else, according to the police. Vijay Kumar Singh, a senior police official here who investigated the rape, said that on Feb. 5 a young man came into his police station to report that his cellphone and laptop had been stolen. When the young man claimed they had been snatched near some isolated farmland at the edge of the city, Mr. Singh became suspicious: it was an unlikely place for a robbery. He pressed for details, and eventually the young man admitted taking his girlfriend to the secluded area so they could be alone, and that five men had beaten him and raped her. Based on the description, the police quickly identified one attacker as a village tough named Tony from Raispur with whom the police had tangled before. When they picked up Tony, who goes by one name, he was still drunk, Mr. Singh said. ''He was so shameless he narrated the whole thing without any sense of remorse,'' he said. Tony later denied that he had raped the woman, according to the police report. Tony had apparently assumed that the rape victim would not come forward because the shame would be too great. Mr. Singh feared that he was right. ''I realized from the beginning that the girl would not help us,'' he said. The police arrested the five young men and charged them with rape and robbery. They tried repeatedly to get the young woman to come forward. The city's police chief sent her an e-mail asking her to cooperate and offering to protect her identity. She sent a curt e-mail reply, the police said: ''The police will not be able to restore my honor.'' The police approached her father, and he urged her to cooperate, said Raghubir Lal, Ghaziabad's police chief. But the next morning her brother found her trying to hang herself, Mr. Lal said. The police decided to stop pressing her to cooperate. Mr. Singh, the officer who first investigated the rape, said that with no physical evidence or victim's testimony, the rape charge would not stand. The police and women's advocates say that successful convictions are central to changing attitudes that tolerate sexual assault. A similar episode in Delhi in November had a very different ending. Men in a pickup abducted and gang-raped a woman who worked at an outsourcing center after a taxi dropped her and a roommate near their apartment. The roommate called the police, who found the young woman and took her to the hospital. She was eager to press charges, the police said. Investigators tracked down and arrested five men. DNA evidence was matched to them, the police said, all but ensuring convictions. Mr. Dhaliwal, the senior Delhi police official who investigated that rape case, estimated that only one in 10 rapes in the Delhi region were reported. ''But this girl was very brave,'' Mr. Dhaliwal said. ''It is a very difficult thing in the Indian context, but you have to report it.''

"120","Execution In a Killing That Fanned Class Rancor","Asia","BEIJING -- A 21-year-old music student who accidentally struck a young woman with his car, then silenced her by stabbing her to death on the roadway, was executed Tuesday in Xi'an, in northwestern China, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The student, Yao Jiaxin, had lost an appeal of a death sentence handed down by a Xi'an court on April 22. The crime had fanned deep public resentment against the ''fu er dai,'' the ''rich second generation'' of privileged families who are widely believed to commit misdeeds with impunity because of their wealth or connections. Mr. Yao was the son of employees of a state-owned corporation in China's defense sector, one of them an executive and a military officer. The victim, Zhang Miao, 26, was a peasant. Mr. Yao, a student at a local music conservatory, was driving a Chevy Cruze in Xi'an last Oct. 20 when he struck Ms. Zhang, who was riding a bicycle. She was not seriously injured, according to news reports. But when Mr. Yao realized that she was memorizing his license plate number, he stabbed her eight times with a knife. He said later that he feared the woman, a poor peasant, would ''be hard to deal with'' should she seek compensation for her injuries. Mr. Yao was detained after a second auto accident that night and initially denied killing Ms. Zhang, but turned himself in four days later. Ms. Zhang's murder came just four days after another privileged son, Li Qiming, struck and killed a young university student with his automobile in Hebei Province, then fled the scene after telling guards who sought to stop him, ''My father is Li Gang,'' a local police official. Both crimes stirred national outrage on China's social-networking Web sites; in January, Li Qiming was sentenced to six years in prison. Ms. Zhang's husband, Wang Hui, had rejected court-ordered compensation of about $6,900 for her death, calling it ''money stained with blood.'' He pledged to delay Ms. Zhang's burial until her killer was executed. A Shanghai lawyer later donated 540,000 renminbi, about $83,300, to her survivors after pledging to pay one renminbi for each message sent to the husband over Sina Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter. On Tuesday, public reaction on Weibo to the execution varied, with some calling it a victory for the rule of law and others calling Mr. Yao a victim of Internet-style mob rule. One prominent Beijing lawyer, Liu Xiaoyuan, noted that it was highly unusual for courts to hand down a death sentence to someone who had turned himself in. A well-known blogger known as Beihei said that Mr. Yao ''was shouted to death by the people,'' adding, ''The Cultural Revolution was started because of this kind of leftist behavior.'' A third well-known commentator in the Chinese media, Li Qianfan, wrote: ''In a country guided by the rule of law, people would not clap their hands in joy over soon being executed. What I really hope to see is not the death of Yao Jiaxin, but the legal system being able to provide protection to the people.''",2011,"China"
"121","A Glimpse of Death Row in China","Asia","A group of Chinese women, photographed inside death row at a Chinese prison, engage in seemingly banal tasks -- painting their nails, brushing their hair, discussing clothes with uniformed guards -- that take on tragic resonance in the final 12 hours before the women's execution. The pictures, more than eight years old, remain stark and poignant, providing a rare, albeit officially approved, glimpse of death row in a country that executes more people each year than any other. The photo slide show and its accompanying captions describing the women's activities were republished late last week on the Web site of Phoenix Television, a private broadcaster based in Hong Kong, and translated by Ministry of Tofu, a blog that is often critical of the Chinese government. Despite having been first published in the Chinese newspaper Southern Weekend nearly a decade ago, on June 25, 2003, the photos have circulated widely this week on Twitter and Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging site, sparking debate. It was unclear why the photos had been republished. The authorities appear to have originally granted access to the photographer in order to use portraits of the condemned women, each scheduled to be executed on drug charges, as a deterrent to future offenders. According to the captions, the pictures were taken days before an international day against drug abuse and trafficking. While the Chinese government has recently moved to limit the number of crimes for which execution can be applied, Chinese law still imposes the death penalty for anyone found smuggling more than 50 grams of heroin, less than two ounces, and many death row inmates have been convicted of smuggling. Foreigners too face death for drug charges in China. There are currently seven Russian nationals on death row in China, including a woman convicted last week of smuggling more than four pounds of heroin, Russia's official RIA Novosti news agency reported. China executed a Pakistani businessman on drug charges in September, the second such execution in two years, local news reports in Pakistan said, and despite requests for clemency from the president of the Philippines, a Filipino man convicted for smuggling more than three pounds of heroin is to be put to death on Dec. 8, The Associated Press reported, following similar executions of three Filipino traffickers in March. In 2009, China executed a 53-year-old British man on drug charges despite an international clemency drive; supporters had said the man, Akmal Shaikh, was mentally ill and should not face death for his crime. China does not publish statistics on the number of people it executes, but Amnesty International estimates the number to be in the thousands. The group's most recent report found that outside of China, at least 527 people were put to death in 2010, down from more than 700 the year before. The four women whose last hours were documented in the photographs were each described as ""drug dealers."" According to the captions, one of the women, identified as Ma Qingxiu, a 49-year-old from Hubei Province, had been convicted and sentenced to death for trafficking about 5 pounds of unspecified drugs on multiple occasions. The other women's crimes were not detailed. Nearly 300,000 people have viewed the images on Phoenix Television's Web site, which elicited more than 3,600 comments and a debate over the application of the death penalty in these cases, and more broadly. ""Our government should abolish the death penalty on drug dealers, especially they should adopt a more lenient legal approach to women given that they have been held down over 5,000 years,"" one commenter wrote. ""Compared with crimes committed by corrupted officials, what they did is not even worth mentioning. Unjust treatment indeed,"" another said. Others were less sympathetic, believing that the Chinese government should deal as harshly as possible with the drug trade, even if it means the execution of women. ""Criminals should get punished regardless of their gender. No need to highlight these four are women,"" wrote one. Another commenter said: ""Consider how many people's lives they have ruined, I think they ought to be shot 20 times to death!"" Some Chinese readers saw the treatment of the women during their final hours, in which they can be seen eating final meals and smiling with guards, as too coddling. ""Those pictures strike me more like they are enjoying a vacation than on death row,"" one commenter observed.",2011,"China"
"122","Pakistan court frees 5 in gang-rape case","Asia","ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN - Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday freed five men accused of gang-raping a village woman in 2002, disappointing rights activists after a long-fought case that received world attention and turned the victim,Mukhtar Mai, into a symbol of hope for oppressed women. The decision upheld an appeals court ruling that found there was not enough evidence to support Mai's account of being dragged into a house and raped, on orders from a village council, as punishment for an alleged romance between Mai's young brother and a woman from a more powerful tribe. The case exposed to the world a side of Pakistan's tribal culture in which women are often punished harshly for affairs or sold as brides to settle disputes or compensate for the perceived sins of their relatives. Fourteen men were originally charged, but only one remains in prison, where he is serving a life sentence. The others, all villagers from the rival tribe, were acquitted by lower courts. Rights advocates in Pakistan called Thursday's verdict a travesty of justice and said it showed the country's judicial system to be patriarchal and prejudiced against women. The panel of justices found that while a ""sordid and despicable"" act may have been committed, Mai's tale of tribal abuses was ""implausible and flimsy."" They took her to task for making confusing statements about how her clothing was torn after the rapes and for failing to go to the police for one week. ""This is a setback for Mukhtar Mai, the broader struggle to end violence against women and the cause of an independent rights-respecting judiciary in Pakistan,"" said Ali Dayan Hasan, a representative of New York-based Human Rights Watch in Karachi. Mai, 42, runs a school for girls in her village in southern Punjab province. She told Geo television that she feared for her life after Thursday's verdict but would not halt her struggle for women's rights. ""This is not justice that I received today, but I have faith in God,"" she said. She asked the government to take measures to protect her. Pakistani women's organizations said they worried the ruling could strengthen ""parallel"" legal systems such as tribal councils, adding that it had ""shaken the confidence of women of Pakistan to stand up for their rights."" But the groups praised Mai for her courage and called her ""a role model for the women of Pakistan."" constablep@washpost.com",2011,"Pakistan"
"123","In Pakistan, a setback for women's rights","Asia","The amazing thing is that she stayed. For the past nine years, Mukhtar Mai has lived in the same village where she was allegedly dragged into a house, raped and pushed out naked, while 200 higher-caste tribesmen sat in approval nearby and her father was too frightened to save her. Mai stayed in the community through tortuous police and judicial investigations, recounting her humiliation to male officials who doubted her story or were beholden to her alleged attackers and to judges who acquitted most of the 14 men accused in her tribal punishment of revenge rape. She remained in Meerwala, a primitive sugar-growing village in the poorest part of Punjab province, even after she became internationally known as a symbol of women's rights. Showered with awards and prizes, she used the money to build a private school. This week, after a Supreme Court panel ruled Thursdaythat it did not believe the prosecution's version of what happened to Mai on June 22, 2002, and set all but one of the remaining defendants free, she said she still intends to stay in the village. ""I have had offers to move to Canada or America, but this is my place and I am needed here,"" Mai, 42, said in a telephone interview from Meerwala on Saturday. When news of the verdict came, she said, ""many villagers showed sympathy, but the landlords gave out sweets,"" a gesture of celebration. Pakistani women's advocates said they feared the ruling will reinforce some of the cruelest traditions relating to women in rural society, where justice is meted out by semiliterate village leaders and the dominant land-owning clans wield more power than the police. One tradition is the system of ""panchayats"" or ""jirgas,"" in which village leaders settle disputes over women with forced marriages, stonings and other punishments. Another is the tight-knit ""baraderi"" or clan structure, which enables stronger tribes -  in this case the Mastois -  to abuse weaker ones, such as Mai's Gujjar clan, with impunity. ""The court could have sent a strong message against these parallel justice systems, which we have been struggling so long to change,"" said Rukshanda Naz of the Aurat Foundation for women in Peshawar. ""Instead, this will make those elements feel more confident. It shows that the patriarchal mind-set in Pakistan still exists at every level."" Pakistan's constitution bans violent abuse of women, but social pressure, political influence and community ""honor"" are often stronger than the law. Rights groups found 8,548 reported cases of violence against women in 2009, including assault and murder, many committed by relatives or ordered by tribal councils. The groups said far more cases are never reported to any state authority. The unique aspect of Mai's experience is that she spoke up. Her long journey through the legal system was a closely watched test case, and observers said the court's rebuff may deepen the silence surrounding the abuse of other rural women. The court's ruling showed a keen understanding of traditional village mores, including the ""extreme sensitivity"" of premarital chastity. The mere rumor that Mai's teenage brother was seen alone in a field with a Mastoi girl sent her clan into a vengeful frenzy. Within 24 hours, clan leaders had ordered Mai to either instantly ""marry"" the girl's brother (according to the defense) or to be raped by him and his relatives as compensation. He was the only defendant whose prison sentence was upheld. Yet justices in the 2 to 1 majority decision expressed little sympathy for Mai. They questioned why her family took a week to report the crime and sarcastically dismissed their fear of the ""alleged mighty"" Mastois. They questioned how Mai could identify her attackers in the dark and why she gave conflicting accounts of how her clothes were torn off. They suggested that a local Muslim cleric was the ""mastermind"" who concocted the plot. In contrast, the judges referred often to the ""presumed innocence"" of the defendants and dismissed the relevance of reports that several had sodomized Mai's brother, then 13, and made up the story about the girl. A doctor found that the boy had been sodomized, but the judges in the majority did not believe that he was too ashamed or scared to tell the police. Only the dissenting judge, Nasir ul-Mulk, acknowledged the ""arrogance"" and impunity of the landlord clan in that community and what it meant for Mai to take her case to the police. ""An illiterate woman of rural humble background,"" he wrote, ""mustered tremendous courage to stand up against powerful influential culprits to bring them to justice."" In the interview, Mai said she feared violence from the freed defendants and noted that their clan has powerful local patrons in the ruling Pakistan People's Party. But she said she was determined to keep helping girls in her community study, gain confidence and demand their rights. ""I have so many students and poor women turning to me. I cannot leave them,"" she said. But Mai also said that the court ruling had left her feeling impotent and at sea. ""We all hoped that if a woman cannot get justice from the police, maybe she can get it from the courts,"" Mai said. ""Now, I don't know where they should turn."" constablep@washpost.com",2011,"Pakistan"
"124","'It Took One Second to Ruin My Life'","Asia","HONG KONG - ""It took one second to ruin my life completely,'' the scarred woman says. ""My face was ruined and nobody was punished at all.'' That chilling remark - from a Pakistani woman who was attacked with acid - is from the film ""Saving Face,"" which won the Academy Award for best short documentary on Sunday night. The film looks at the efforts of a British plastic surgeon, Dr. Muhammad Jawad, who travels to Pakistan to do reconstructive surgery on women attacked with acid. Two Pakistani women, Zakia and Rukhsana, also are central figures in the film. The directors are Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and Daniel Junge. The film's Web site is here. ""It's more important that the Pakistani on the stage speak,"" Mr. Junge said as he stood aside for Ms. Obaid-Chinoy when they took the stage to receive their Oscars, as reported in The Times' live Oscars blogby my colleague Dave Itzoff. ""We want to dedicate this award to all the heroes on the ground working in Pakistan,"" said Ms. Obaid-Chinoy, who won an international Emmy for her previous film, ""Pakistan's Taliban Generation,"" which looked at the recruitment of young jihadis following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. My colleague Nicholas Kristof has written movingly about the plague of acid attacks against women in Pakistan (and across Asia) for a number of years. Likewise, our former colleague, Dexter Filkins, did a powerful Times Magazine piece on acid attacks against Afghan schoolgirls. And another former colleague, Seth Mydans, has reportedevocative pieces about acid attacks on Cambodian women. In one of his columns, Nick profiled Naeema Azar, a Pakistani woman who had been a self-assured real estate agent - until she was attacked by her ex-husband. He poured acid onto her, Ms. Azar said, and she recalled hearing herself screaming. ""The flesh of my cheeks was falling off,'' she said. ""The bones on my face were showing, and all of my skin was falling off."" Nick said when he first met Ms. Azar she was wearing a black cloak that covered her head and face. ""Then she removed the covering,'' he said, ""and I flinched.'' ""Acid had burned away her left ear and most of her right ear. It had blinded her and burned away her eyelids and most of her face, leaving just bone.'' Ms. Azar had six skin grafts but still could not close her eyes or mouth. She refused to eat in front of others - it was too humiliating when bits of food would slip out. Faisal Kapadia, with The Express Tribune newspaper in Karachi, a publishing partner of The International Herald Tribune, interviewed Ms. Obaid-Chinoy earlier this month. Here are a few of their exchanges, which have been slightly compressed for space: What made you choose acid violence as a subject for your documentary? Acid violence is a systemically under-reported crime. ""Saving Face"" is a story that intends to bring this issue into mainstream public discourse as equally as highlighting the incredible resilience of the survivors of acid violence. It also shows the way Pakistani citizens come to the aid of their fellow countrymen. It is a story about hope in the time of unimaginable circumstances and about the way a community heals and moves forward. Did you face any issues while traveling to some of these areas? Were the locals forthcoming? My team and I didn't face any security issues and were never put in harm's way. But we did have to struggle against a mindset that culturally accepted such forms of violence. Stories like these often get no fanfare, but in your case it has resulted in an Oscar nomination. Do you plan to use this attention to further the cause? Yes, I make films because I want them to change mindsets and spark change. Films have the ability to humanize a story, and I hope that ""Saving Face"" brings us one step closer to eradicating acid violence in Pakistan.

"125","When Home Is No Refuge for Women","Asia","""This month, two women's stories, told courageously, helped to underline the reality of domestic violence in India,"" Nilanjana S. Roy writes about Nita Bhalla, a journalist, who wrote for the BBC about being physically assaulted by her partner and Meena Kandasamy, a poet and writer on social issues who wrote in Outlook, a national newsmagazine, of surviving a violent marriage: ""My skin has seen enough hurt to tell its own story,"" Ms. Kandasamy wrote. Both Ms. Kandasamy and Ms. Bhalla are, in Ms. Bhalla's phrase, ""professional, educated, independent"" women, but as surveys of domestic violence in the country indicate, their empowerment was no protection against abuse, Ms. Roy writes. In 2005-6, the National Health and Family Survey, conducted by the Ministry of Health in households across 29 states, mapped domestic violence in India. It found that about 40 percent of married women across the country had experienced domestic violence; the survey called it a serious public health problem. In the six years since the Health Ministry data were published, some progress has been made, on the legal and social fronts. More women have begun to talk about domestic violence (only 1 percent of reported violence and abuse is instigated by women against their male partners, according to the survey findings). In 2011, the popular Hindi television series ""Dil Se Di Dua-Saubhagyavati Bhava"" told the story of a woman married to a man who is alternately charming and abusive. Perhaps the most significant change has been in the application of the Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, a landmark piece of legislation that took effect in 2006. For the first time, it formally recognizes a woman's right to protection from violence at home and addresses verbal, emotional and economic abuse as well as physical and sexual abuse. Significantly for India, it includes unmarried couples and ""sisters, widows and mothers"" living in shared households. A major problem identified by women's rights organizations and the Delhi-based Lawyers Collective Women's Rights Initiative 2011 report is police attitudes toward domestic violence, Ms.Roy writes. The police are often the point of first contact for women who want to report violence in their homes, ""there is confusion among police officers as to what constitutes domestic violence,"" she writes. ""For instance, some officers think that verbal abuse or a slap is acceptable and does not need to be reported."" Read the full story here.",2012,"India"
"126","For Women Workers in Gurgaon, Strict But Toothless Laws","Asia","The issue of women's safety in Gurgaon has come into the spotlight this week, after a woman who said she worked for a pub there was gang-raped as she was leaving work. More than 150 people gathered Wednesday night in front of the Sahara Mall, where the pub is located, in protest. ""We protested to demand safety for women in the city and show solidarity with the victim. A lot of men walk around with impunity,"" said Manak Matiyani, 27, who was part of the group that led the public awareness campaign. Gurgaon, the outsourcing mega-city south of New Delhi, has transformed radically in recent years, but it still relies on laws written decades ago, when the area was part of Punjab state. These laws contain strict, specific rules for working women. Women were originally prohibited from working at night, but the law was amended. Commercial establishments must ""provide adequate security and proper transport facility to the women workers during the night shift,"" according to the Punjab Shops and Commercial Establishment Act (1958). Gurgaon is part of the state of Haryana, which was carved out of Punjab in 1966. Companies employing women at night must also ""conduct an annual self-defense training workshop"" for female employees, and ensure they board transportation in the presence of security guards, the law says. The Punjab Excise Act (1914) prohibits the employment of women at premises that serve alcohol in ""any part of such premises in which such liquor or intoxicating drug is consumed by the public."" The official interpretation of this law is even stricter. ""Women cannot be employed by any establishment that serves alcohol on their premises,"" said, Ashok Kadyan, deputy excise comissioner, Gurgaon. If companies violate these laws, the punishment is hardly steep. First-time offenders of the Punjab Shops act are fined 100 rupees (about $2), as per Section 26 of the act:  Gurgaon officials say that 100 establishments were fined in the last six months for violating the overall Punjab shops act, but could not specify which fines related to women workers. Gurgaon, which transformed from farmland to instant megalopolis after multinational companies including General Electric and American Express brought back office businesses to India, employs tens of thousands of women in the outsourcing business, about 35,000 of whom work night shifts. Thousands more women work in Gurgaon's malls and restaurants. The pub this week's rape victim said she worked for, the Last Chance, denies she was ever employed with them. The bar has ""never employed female workers,"" said Freddy Johnson, a shift manager at Last Chance. Gurgaon police first questioned the victim's allegations, and then confirmed she was raped after a medical test. Police say she worked as a ""help,"" a woman who helps men get into the couples-only bar in exchange for money. Some newspapers carried stories claiming that the city administration banned women from working at commercial establishments after 8 p.m. after the rape was reported, but Gurgaon administrators say they were misinterpreted. There is no new order, just a ""reiteration of the existing law,"" said P.C. Meena, deputy commissioner administration, Gurgaon. ""The B.P.O and I.T. industry are complying with government norms,"" Mr. Meena said, and following the 1958 law. Pubs and discotheques also have to abide by these regulations, Mr. Meena said. ""They are just 5 percent of the problem, in 95 percent cases establishment are following the rules,"" he said. If an organizations wants to hire women to work between 8:00 P.M. and 6:00 A.M., they need to seek permission from the labor department of Gurgaon, and follow the  regulations laid down in the act, said Anuradha Lamba, deputy labor commissioner, Gurgaon.  ""We have started inspecting female workers to ensure that they are not forced to work beyond 8 p.m.,"" Ms. Lamba said. Mr. Meena said police and the labor department have to work collectively with the administration to crack down on some of these organizations, which flout the rules. If they don't comply with the regulations, ""we can cancel their license,"" Mr. Meena said. The administration did not cancel a single license in 2011. The administration will conduct surprise inspections and there will be more police deployment in areas, which are prone to crime, he said. Gurgaon police commissioner K.K. Sindu said Wednesday that five men arrested by the police in connection with the rape case have been identified by the victim.

"128","Crackdown on Tibetans in Delhi Includes Young Women","Asia","Tight security has gripped India's capital since the Wednesday afternoon arrival of the Chinese president for an economic summit. In Delhi's Tibetan districts, residents have been on ""defacto house arrest,"" Jim Yardley writes for The New York Times. More than 250 Tibetan activists have been jailed ""under preventive custody,"" he writes. Police officials are stationed every few yards along the city's arteries, keeping their eyes peeled for residents of Tibetan ethnicity, and detaining those who attempt to reach the hotel Hu Jintao was scheduled to stay in. Nonetheless, activists circulated text messages Thursday morning saying they planned a protest in front of the hotel where the summit will be held. A Tibetan exile died Wednesday after setting himself on fire during an agitation by his community on Monday to protest Mr. Hu's India visit. China's government claims Tibet is an integral part of their country but Tibetans oppose Chinese rule. India has welcomed Tibetans, hosting an estimated 120,000 of them, including their spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. On Wednesday, Tibetans groups sought to rally outside the Oberoi Hotel at 3 p.m., where Mr. Hu was to arrive. The hotel facade was cordoned off, while paramilitary troops were thickly clustered around Tibetan neighborhoods. Police officials patrolled the streets looking for Tibetan groups. Activists reported that two girls and a boy were detained outside the hotel, but most were stopped before they got close. One group was detained right next to the new 11-story glass headquarters of the Central Bureau of Investigation - India's top anti-corruption watchdog. Eight petite Tibetan women sat huddled in a field next to the building, surrounded by more than a dozen police officials. They had arrived at a nearby metro station and crossed the field to make their way to the Oberoi to protest when they were stopped by police. ""We were told to take any Tibetans to the Lajpat Nagar (police) station,"" said one police official, who didn't disclose his name, but added that they were waiting for a senior police officer to give them the go-ahead before they brought the women in. Orgen Tenzin, 21, said they needed to show their support for a free Tibet. ""The situation in Tibet is so bad. We simply want basic human rights in Tibet,"" she said. The Tibetans, all college students, said they weren't going to leave unless they were allowed to march to the hotel. They wanted to protest against Mr. Hu, who they believed was responsible for the plight of their community in Tibet. ""You're forgetting what China's done,"" Deweeng admonished the police. ""We can't even keep one photo of Dalai Lama in Tibet in our homes."" The women said they had left their homes in Tibet when they were children and, except for the occasional phone call, were barely in contact with their parents, who they hadn't seen since they left. They had been cared for by the Tibetan exile community in India. ""The Dalai Lama is our god, our parent, our everything,"" said Deweeng, 20, wearing a plaid shirt and sneakers. For most of the time the girls were detained in the field, they pleaded with the police and made a case for why they should be allowed to agitate. The police officials looked more amused than menacing except for this brief struggle that India Ink captured: ""We don't care if we're arrested,"" said Tnchoe defiantly after the tussle. ""We're not arresting you. We're detaining you,"" clarified a police official. Did the students feel threatened by the police? ""We respect their duties,"" said Deweeng solemnly, noting that the police were only following orders. As the afternoon field detention continued, curious passersby watched from the pavement and from the shanties bordering the barren field. The students cracked half-serious comments about being let off. ""We're your children's age,"" pleaded Tnchoe with a wicked grin. ""I've never hurt a fly in my life."" Some of the students giggled at this. The police officials cracked a smile. ""You're not even giving water,"" whined one of the Tibetan youths. A soft drink bottle filled with water was tossed to them. The banter vanished once the second the police officer arrived. ""I will use force,"" barked Inspector Dalip Singh. ""You are violating the law."" The students instinctively huddled closer together. And then they were, as promised, forcefully hauled off: Mr. Singh declined to comment about where the students were being taken and how long they would be detained in police custody.",2012,"China"

"131","'SlutWalk' and 'Girlcott': Women Fight Sexual Violence in India","Asia","NEW DELHI - When the first SlutWalk demonstration was held in India last year, bringing together several hundred young women protesting the everyday violence that they or their friends had faced, the response from some in the news media - and a few veteran feminists - was prickly and defensive. Wasn't SlutWalk an imported idea, more suited to foreign countries than to India? A debate erupted over the word itself. Few Indians use the word ''slut,'' and the organizers of the march had attempted to translate it as ''Besharami Morcha.'' Besharami means ''shameless woman.'' Since then, more and more women have found other ways of protesting. Flash mobs took to the Delhi Metro to demand greater safety for women on public transport. After officials in Gurgaon responded to a rape by ordering shopping malls to close early, Richa Dubey started Girlcott, urging women not to shop in the mall-heavy city on weekends. The Girlcott slogan was simple but effective: ''No safety, no money.'' Gurgaon officials backtracked on their order. But the public and media response to the recent sexual assault of a teenage girl in the city of Guwahati suggests a small but significant shift, as I write in my latest Page Two column. This time, critical attention has focused on the assailants, not on the victim. Could these protests, as varied as they are, signal real changes in the way Indians perceive and address sexual assault?",2012,"India"
"132","In Cambodia, Sentencing of Women Activists Sparks Outcry","Asia","Many around the world have died protecting it: land. The issue is highly charged in Cambodia where it flared again last week after 13 women, including a 72-year-old, werejailed for illegal occupation of land and ""aggravated rebellion"" after demonstrating on the site of their former homes in Phnom Penh, knocked down to make way for a commercial development, The Associated Press reported. The sentences, after a lawyer-less, three-hour trial, have prompted an outcry from local and international human rights groups and Cambodian opposition politicians, the Phnom Penh Post reported. An opposition lawmaker, Mu Sochua, called on the international community to suspend aid to the Cambodian government, saying financial contributions from overseas should be given to NGOs, instead. ""I call on women's networks across the world to take action. I call on (Secretary of State) Hillary Clinton to take action,"" she said, singling out the United States. Perhaps that was because Kurt M. Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs at the U.S. State Department, was in Cambodia on Friday, where he made plain one of his goals in talks with officials was to secure Cambodia's support for the peaceful resolution of another, major ownership issue flaring in Southeast Asia - over the South China Sea. ""We're at a critical period. We're counting on the leadership of Cambodia to ensure the future of peace and prosperity,"" Mr. Campbell said in a statement released by the State Department. The latest bout of trouble began last Tuesday, when the women were arrested as they sat on sand, singing, at Boueng Kak, Phnom Penh's biggest lake, where their homes had once been. Here is footage of the arrest. Or you can view it below from the time it turned violent: The roots of the dispute reach back to 2007 when the government awarded the land to the Shukaku company, owned by Lao Meng Khin, a senator of the ruling Cambodian People's Party. As The Associated Press has reported, a Chinese company also is involved in the development deal, with plans to build a hotel, office buildings and luxury housing. Last year, the prime minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, appeared to offer an olive branch, granting some land to families holding out at the lake. But they say the boundaries of their land were never made clear, according to the Save the Boeung Kak Campaign. Pung Chhic Kek, president of the group, said lawyers from her organization were barred from talking with the defendants and introducing witnesses. Some of the women, including 72-year-old Nget Khun, had part of their sentence suspended. Nget Khun will only serve a year. A government spokesman, Phay Siphan of the Council of Ministers, told the Phnom Penh Post the trial had nothing to do with the government. Neither the Ministry of Justice nor Phnom Penh municipal authorities could be reached for comment, the newspaper said. Land, both urban and rural land, its ownership, management and use is an explosive topic in Cambodia. As my colleague Mark McDonald reported earlier in May, Chut Wutty, a prominent anti-logging activist who helped expose the secretive process of ""concessions"" by which land is being granted to Cambodian and foreign developers, was shot dead last month near a Chinese-built hydroelectric dam. The report ""Carving up Cambodia: One Concession at a Time""shows the concessions process. Also earlier this month, facing growing protests by villagers and warnings about disappearing wilderness, the government suspended the granting of land to domestic and foreign companies in a move to curb forced evictions and illegal logging, Reuters reported. But rights groups say the temporary measure does not go far enough and a permanent ban is needed.",2012,"Cambodia"
"133","China Suspends Family Planning Workers After Forced Abortion","Asia","SHANGHAI -- China suspended three local family planning officials in northwest China this week following a public outcry over reports that they had forced a young woman to undergo an abortion seven months into her pregnancy, according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency. The suspensions, ordered on Thursday, came just days after graphic photos were posted on the Internet showing a 23-year-old woman named Feng Jianmei lying in a hospital bed with the remains of the fetus, soaked in blood. The story received widespread attention online, and a few days ago it was the most popular topic on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. The woman's husband, who had posted the images, told the Chinese news media that on June 2, family planning officials in Shaanxi Province forced his wife to abort her second child after the couple were told that they had violated the nation's one-child policy. The couple had been ordered to pay a $6,300 fine if they wanted to go ahead with the pregnancy, he told the news media. When they failed to pay, Ms. Feng was beaten and given an injection that induced a late-term abortion, the couple said. Families who disobey the one-child policy are often treated harshly by the Chinese authorities. But the government's response to the public outcry -- punishing local authorities -- is unusual. The family planning officials were also forced to apologize to the woman, according to Xinhua. The Shaanxi Population and Planning Commission told Xinhua that the local officials had committed a ''serious violation'' of regulations and suggested that family planning officials in other parts of the country should draw ''profound lessons'' from the case. The case comes just weeks after Chen Guangcheng, a blind activist who battled family planning officials in another province, escaped brutal house detention and fled to the United States Embassy in Beijing. With the aid of American officials, he has since been allowed to travel to New York to study. Mr. Chen had campaigned to expose forced sterilizations and abortions. Local news media reports quoted the authorities in Zhenping County, in Shaanxi Province, as saying that the woman had given her consent to an abortion. But the husband strongly denied that, saying: ''Our baby was 7 months old. Do you think we would agree to an abortion?'' Xinhua said such late-term abortions were prohibited under Chinese law. Ms. Feng told China Business, a newspaper, that she was coerced into signing a statement agreeing to the abortion and putting her fingerprints on it. Then, she said, ''around 9 a.m. on June 2, many people rushed to cover my face with a black coat and dragged me to the hospital.'' The government said it had sent an investigation team to Zhenping County this week, and The Associated Press quoted from a statement released Friday by the deputy mayor of Ankang, the city where Ms. Feng lives, saying: ''Today, I am here on behalf of the municipal government to see you and express our sincere apology to you. I hope to get your understanding.''",2012,"China"
"134","Sexual Harassment Prosecutions Get Short Shrift in India, Lawyer Says","Asia","The low numbers of convictions in sexual harassment and molestation cases in India has caused people to take matters  into their own hands. Last week, images of the men who molested a teenage girl outside a bar in Guwahati were posted on social networking sites with messages urging people to identify the men and bring them to justice. India Ink spoke with  Vijayendra Pratap Singh, a partner at Amarchand & Mangaldas & Suresh A. Shroff & Co, a law firm in Delhi, about sexual assault, molestation and the justice system. According to the National Crime Records Bureau's statistical databases, the number of convictions has fallen in recent years even as the number of women filing complaints has increased. Could you explain the difficulty in prosecution with sexual harassment cases in India? The difficulty has to do with the fact of how people look at sexual harassment and molestation versus more traditional crimes against the body. People often think that more heinous crimes against the body such as rape are more serious, and therefore give them more weightage. Outraging the modesty is largely a subjective standard versus when there is a woman raped and there is evidence and scientific proof. It is also quite likely that the investigator in charge of the case does not consider it as serious an offence as the other offences that he or she has to investigate. The teams that are investigating have to be sensitized and equally informed that if you do not nip crimes like these in the bud it might embolden people to take a more aggressive stance against women and there might be an increase in what they consider more serious crime. Finally it is important to get people to understand what sexual harassment and molestation are because again these are subjective standards that people perceive differently. In cases of sexual harassment, there is often little faith in the police to follow up on complaints. As in the Guwahati case, this often leads to the public taking things into their own hands, circulating videos and images of the accused, demanding a public naming and shaming. What is your take on the idea of public justice in the face of police inaction? The thing is, whenever you get the public to intervene, today you are able to say this is good and this might help getting justice. But tomorrow the same public without accountability may do something more egregious which might breach a person's right to trial. Such as, the public may go to the site of the crime and in the case that there is evidence there they might tamper the evidence and thereby hamper the investigation rather than assist investigation. The Nithari case was one like this. Also, when you have newspapers flashing names and faces you end up creating a prejudice in the mind of the person who is judging the matter. On the morning of a hearing the judge may or may not read the file of the case but he will read the papers. If the case is on the front page of a paper then it might end up coloring the mind of the judge. Also until such a time that the footage is found to be correct and authenticated it will not be advisable to use such footage. Also, in my opinion newspapers and television channels should use some discretion in covering such cases; the Supreme Court is currently looking into the idea of a trial by media. What is your opinion about how circulating videos or images related to a criminal act, as with the Guwahati case, are exposing individual identities? Are there legal concerns about that? There is a legal ramification. From the victim's point of view the act of molestation coupled with public humiliation is bad enough but to add to this a circulation of their picture publicly is unfair. We have to balance our attempts to aid a conviction with protecting the dignity of the victim. When it comes to the accused the question is whether the footage is genuine.  Which is something that needs to be captured and tested immediately rather then set up on a site when in the process of putting it up you might destroy an image that could be evidence. Does the rise of social media and mobile phones with cameras have a long-term impact on the problem of men molesting or harassing women on the streets in India? Do you think it will lead to the numbers of such attacks dropping? That is something that definitely acts as a deterrent and may bring about a greater degree of probity in public life. However, one needs to be careful about the way in which this is done. Again, there is fine balancing between ensuring a conviction and invading an individual's privacy and right to a fair trial. What can be done to improve upon India's track record of dealing with sexual assault and molestation? This is a systemic question. One part of this is training and sensitization for the prosecution, investigators and judges. On the other end, another matter to be given importance to is that, an adequate number of judges are available to deal with such an issue. It is a question of the infrastructure being enough to sustain itself. One possibility is to set up especially dedicated or fast-track courts to deal with crimes against women but then there is also the need for judges to supervise these courts. The current issue is the inadequacy of judges to deal with matters before the court.",2012,"India"
"135","In Haryana, Hundreds Protest State's Response to Rape","Asia","In Haryana, where a number of high-profile rape cases have attracted national attention in recent weeks, 800 protesters took to the streets on Monday to demand better policing and a safer environment for women. ""Women are no longer ready to take this kind of treatment meted out by a patriarchal system and a government that connives with the accused because they are the powerful,"" said Shabnam Hashmi, a trustee at Anhad, a human rights group that works in the Mewat region of Haryana. Several rape cases reported in Haryana in recent weeks have attracted widespread attention for their severity, the fact that the victims were from lower castes than their attackers and a ""blame the victim"" response from local officials and village councils. Last week a teenage girl committed suicide after being raped, by setting herself on fire, and another victim's father killed himself after he was shown a video of his daughter being raped. While activists and local media have repeatedly quoted a figure of 17 rapes in Haryana in the past month, that number is probably low. There were 733 cases of rape reported in Haryana, population 25 million, in 2011, or an average of 61 a month, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau. Over the last year, the Haryana government has been criticized for their response to these and other high-profile rapes and the state's seeming inability to curb sexual assaults. The Haryana spokesman for the Congress Party, Dharambir Goyat, was quoted as saying that he thought 90 percent of rapes were consensual, but he was later rebuked by the party for his statement. On Monday, the Haryana Congress legislator Sampat Singh said, ""Haryana has progressed economically, but it has not developed mentally and intellectually, leading to rising incidences of rape in the state."" Meanwhile, the West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said that the increase in rapes in India could be attributed to the fact that men and women interact with each other more freely than before. The All-India Democratic Women's Association led the rally, and were joined by the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch, the National Federation of Indian Women and the Center for Social Research. Protesters in Rohtak held a public meeting on Monday where activists discussed possible solutions, while the families of rape victims shared their stories. After the meeting, they marched to the district commissioner's office and submitted a memorandum that demanded the government ensure quick and fair investigations into rape cases, set up fast-track courts to deal with sexual assault and rape cases and create more effective police forces. ""The protest was meant to express our anger and dissatisfaction at the Haryana government who has yet not arrested many rapists, and to pressurize the government to act,"" said Ranjana Kumari, director of the Center for Social Research, who attended the protest. The police attacked the crowd with sticks, she said, which caused a stampede that injured three people. ""What was a peaceful meeting suddenly turned violent,"" Ms. Kumari said. In Delhi, the National Federation of Indian Women held a rally in a show of support for women of the Dalit caste, many of whom are victims of rape in Haryana. ""In this country, the biggest challenge for women is to safeguard their right to be born, and from that stage onwards women face all sorts of discrimination,"" said Annie Raja, general secretary of the National Federation of Indian Women. ""Even though internationally we have a reputation to be a developing country with prospects for economic growth, but for the women of this country, day by day we are living a more frightened life."" Ms. Raja said that while each successive government promises to put in place new legislation to safeguard women, the government fails to enforce existing laws. What especially angers women's rights groups is the local authorities' penchant for blaming the rapes on the victims. In September, a member of the state's khap panchayat, a self-appointed council of village heads, said that in order to curb such crimes the marriage age should be lowered to 16, from 18, so that women won't be tempted to satisfy their sexual urges elsewhere. Balwan Singh Nain, a 48-year-old farmer and khap member, told India Ink, ""Women maintain a family's honor. Not men. If she cannot keep her honor, it is solely her fault."" Activists contend that the presence of khap panchayats undermines the system of law and order in the state of Haryana. ""The problem is not just the numbers of women who are getting raped but the discourse after the rape and the response of the state,"" said Kavita Srivastava, national secretary of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, who attended the protest in Rohtak. ""The khap panchayats are not just an embarrassment but part of the problem - they are reinforcing the unlawful behavior of these men."" Those who report rapes often find themselves shunned by the local authorities. In a recent case that came to light on Saturday, a 13-year-old schoolgirl was allegedly raped over a period of four months by a fruit vendor outside her school in Fatehbad, a town in Haryana. When the girl's mother lodged a complaint against the man, the school authorities reacted by expelling the girl and her two younger sisters. On Sunday, the school authorities said the three sisters had left the school on their own. However, after the girl underwent a medical examination that confirmed that she had been raped, the suspect was arrested. ""The whole attitude of the police is so anti-women,"" said Ms. Srivastava. ""There is the breakdown of the criminal justice system on one hand and the lack of an enabling environment for women on the other. In this kind of environment there can be no justice."" On Friday, the Haryana government announced several measures designed to reduce the incidence of crimes against women, including an increase in police patrols in rural areas. The government also opened a 24-hour hotline for women in the police control room in Panchkula district and is planning to set up one in every district. ""The idea is that if any woman calls saying that they have been harassed on the street, at college or elsewhere, we will send police help immediately,"" said Meenakshi Sharma, a female constable who answered the women's hotline in Panchkula, which has yet to receive any calls for help. Ms. Sharma said that they did not receive any special training for manning the hotline, which is one reason that activists are dubious about the efficacy of such measures. ""It is too little and too late,"" said Ms. Kumari of the Center for Social Research. ""Having a helpline is not enough. There has to be somebody on the other side to provide help. The Haryana police have to become much more effective if it hopes to actually protect these women.""",2012,"India"
"136","A Society's Dizzying Changes Cast the Police in the Role of Relationship Counselor","Asia","BANGALORE, India -- The three stars and the red-and-blue ribbon on his shoulder strap indicate that M. L. Purushotham is a police inspector. But his unofficial job title might well be this: redeemer of relationships and savior of marriages.A typical case these days for Mr. Purushotham, who works out of the Yeshwantpur police station in west Bangalore, involved a couple in their 20s, well educated and working for different multinational corporations. She was from the eastern state of Orissa, and he from Tamil Nadu, in the south. When the young woman walked into the police station, she told of how they had met, fallen in love and moved in together. But after nine months of living together, they were breaking up at the insistence of the man's parents, who were upset at the violation of tradition. She wished to marry, she said, but he was resisting. The woman asked to file a criminal complaint against him for using the promise of marriage as a ruse. As tumultuous societal changes transform Bangalore, many young middle-class Indians are struggling to cope. They arrive in the city for work and live away from their families. Unmoored from home and community, many are taking their problems to the only symbol of authority that is accessible around the clock: the police. An incessant rush of confused young people, squabbling lovers and bickering spouses at the 100-odd police stations in Bangalore has thrust many officers into a role that many never expected when they enlisted. ''There is material for many, many Ph.D. theses in these complaints that come to our police stations,'' said B. N. S. Reddy, a joint commissioner of police. Police officers around the world, of course, often take on the role of family mediators as well as crime fighters, especially in cases of domestic violence. In Bangalore, however, many of the city's young people seem to have the police on speed dial for any and all kinds of relationship troubles. Mr. Reddy enumerated the reasons for this surge: Urban life is transforming India, and young people want to assert their independence. Women are financially stable, and marital equations are changing. Partners' expectations of each other have moved far beyond the traditional roles of male provider and female nurturer. A working woman in her early 30s recently walked into his office to complain that her husband was abusive and cruel. Her husband came later and complained that she smoked, drank and partied too much. He insisted that she be a ''traditional wife.'' A few conversations later, Mr. Reddy managed to persuade the couple to agree that they had been smoking, drinking and partying together for many months before marrying. ''They needed to adjust to the marriage and to each other,'' he said. The deluge at the police stations could stem from the woeful lack of counseling and mediation services in Bangalore. It could also reflect ignorance of the alternative sources of help that are available. Of the many young people with personal issues, only a fraction seek professional support, said Deepa Dasgupta, a counselor. ''Some don't know they can get help; others don't know who to turn to,'' said Ms. Dasgupta, who works with companies to counsel stressed-out employees. At the same time, going to a marriage counselor or a therapist carries a stigma, especially among the poor and the lower middle class, said Sridhar Ramanujam, a branding professional who is also a volunteer at Vishwas, a free counseling service here. ''If you say you are seeing a counselor, some immediately conclude that you must be mentally ill,'' Mr. Ramanujam said. The more serious abuse and domestic violence cases are initially routed, under police protocol, to Vishwas and other services for counseling. Yet a stream of young and unhappy people are flooding the police stations with seemingly frivolous cases that are clearly outside the police's purview, officers say. One man complained that his wife spent a lot of time in the bathroom with her cellphone. Was she having an extramarital affair, he wanted to know. A woman came to the police station saying that her workaholic husband returned from the office and immediately switched on the television. She wanted the police to talk him into engaging in conversation with her. Another griped that her husband invited friends over all the time and that she was expected to put food on the table. A newlywed man said his wife's mother was constantly calling her and interfering in the relationship. ''Our training teaches us how to put up cases, how to find evidence, how to set the law in motion, but no police academy can prepare you for this,'' said S. Badarinath, an inspector at the Cubbon Park police station in downtown Bangalore. To add to the stress, many in this young and restless generation expect instant results when they walk into police stations. ''They think we can create magic, police magic,'' Mr. Reddy said. Some may come in contemplating an official complaint. ''But we constantly educate young people that a complaint and an ensuing arrest could ruin any chance of a patch-up,'' Mr. Reddy said. ''The relationship would be as good as finished right there.'' But more times than not, such incidents end up being resolved happily. Alveera Mustafa, 29, a software engineer with a large company, said she had the police to thank for her now-stable marriage. Ms. Mustafa and her husband, also an engineer, had severe misunderstandings within weeks of their arranged marriage. Ms. Mustafa took her problem to the police station in Whitefield, a suburb. The officer summoned Ms. Mustafa's husband and guided several candid conversations around a table. ''If not for the police,'' Ms. Mustafa said, reflecting on those encounters some months ago, ''we would have been divorced.'' In the case of the cohabiting Orissa-Tamil Nadu couple, however, the police could not cajole the man to marry his girlfriend. It took the woman many weeks to realize that a marriage held under the threat of a criminal complaint would not work anyway. Despite the complaints about having to deal with so many personal disputes, many police officers say they get enormous job satisfaction from helping sort out young people's lives, said Anjumala Nayak, an inspector at an all-female police station in central Bangalore. ''People waylay me in public events sometimes,'' she said. ''I may not even remember them, and they thank me for saving their marriages.''",2012,"India"
"137","Seeking the Right to Be Female in Malaysia","Asia","SEREMBAN, MALAYSIA -- The feminine figure dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, makeup carefully applied, drew little attention from other customers at the fast-food restaurant in Seremban, a city about an hour's drive south of Kuala Lumpur. The 26-year-old began wearing women's clothing at age 13. Thanks to plastic surgery in neighboring Thailand, a daily dose of hormones and a feminine nickname, she is able to present herself as female to the outside world. But her official identification card -- which Malaysians must produce in dealings like job interviews -- declares that her name is Adam Shazrul Bin Mohammad Yusoff and that she is male. The discrepancy between her appearance and her officially recognized gender presents much more than just awkward moments in Malaysia, where Shariah, or Islamic law, bans Muslim men from dressing or posing as women. Penalties differ in individual states, but in Negri Sembilan, where the 26-year-old lives, convicted offenders may be sentenced to up to six months in prison, fined as much as 1,000 ringgit, about $325, or both. Tired of living in fear of prosecution, the 26-year-old -- who has been arrested twice and was once fined 900 ringgit -- and three other transgender people are challenging the law in the secular courts, arguing that it violates the Malaysian Constitution, which bans discrimination based on gender and protects freedom of expression. A verdict in their case -- the first time anyone has sought to overturn the law -- is expected next Thursday. ''It's for freedom -- to be like everybody else, to wear what we like,'' said the 26-year-old, explaining why she is taking part in the case. ''This shouldn't happen. It's an unjust law. We are just human beings. We are not doing anything wrong.'' Transgender people -- those who act like, dress as or feel themselves to be the sex opposite of what they were born -- say they are often ostracized in Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country where homosexual acts are also banned and punishable by caning and as much as 20 years' imprisonment. Some states also have laws that bar Muslim women from dressing as men, but activists say the religious authorities focus mainly on those born male who wear women's clothes. Across the Asia-Pacific region, transgender people are subject to discrimination, harassment, and verbal, sexual and physical abuse within their families, at school, in workplaces, in the provision of services and in society more broadly, according to a report released in May by the U.N. Development Program. The report states that there could be as many as 9.5 million transgender people across the Asia Pacific region and that ''alarming numbers'' of transwomen -- men who identify or present as women -- are H.I.V. positive. Support groups say transgender people in Malaysia face considerable discrimination. They say they often struggle to find work, prompting some to turn to sex work, and that they often face abuse, sometimes by the authorities. The 26-year-old and the three other litigants in the court case -- Mohammad Juzaili Bin Mohammad Khamis, Shukur Bin Jani and Wan Fairol Bin Wan Ismail -- have all been arrested on accusations of dressing as women. Two of their cases are continuing, pending the outcome of the judicial review. The four are arguing not only that the law is unconstitutional but also that it should not apply to them because they have been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder. The 26-year-old, who supplements the money she earns as a makeup artist with sex work, said religious officers groped her when they arrested her. ''They were very rough,'' she said, adding that she is fortunate that her family accepts her, unlike the case for some of her friends. She said that she turned down a job offer at a bank when its managers insisted that she cut her hair short, and that she turned to sex work because it helped pay for the ''monthly maintenance'' required to keep her looking female, including hormones, and allowed her to dress as she liked. One of the other litigants, a 25-year-old makeup artist who has been fined 1,000 ringgit on three occasions for dressing as a woman, said religious officers had once punched her in the face. She said she wanted to officially change her name and gender, because it was stressful knowing that she could be arrested at any time and jailed. ''This is not just for me,'' she said of the court case. ''It's also for the community. This is something that needs to be done. We need to highlight the existence of transpeople in this country,'' she said. The Negri Sembilan State and central government departments responsible for Islamic affairs did not respond to requests for comment. Thilaga Sulathireh, an independent researcher and rights advocate who has helped the four take their case to court, said that there were no publicly available figures indicating the total number of Malaysian men who have been prosecuted for dressing as women but that arrests were not uncommon. ''It's unfortunate that there are Shariah laws to do moral policing,'' she said, adding that two transgender people in Malacca State have also filed for a judicial review of the law since finding out about the Negri Sembilan case. Ms. Sulathireh said that non-Muslim men who dress as women have been fined under a civil law governing public indecency but that this was less common. She said that although Shariah judges could exercise discretion, they generally seemed to follow a ''three-strike rule,'' under which people are jailed after being arrested three times. But that is not always the case. Nisha Ayub was jailed for three months after her first arrest for dressing as a woman 14 years ago. Ms. Nisha, who was 20 at the time, said prison wardens forced her to walk naked in front of the male inmates. ''It's something I can't forget until today,'' she said. Ms. Nisha, who now works as the transgender program manager at the PT Foundation, a nongovernmental organization that provides counseling and health support for transgender people, said many were often afraid to go to hospitals because they feared discrimination from medical staff. Support groups say a fatwa, or religious edict, issued in the 1980s that forbids Muslims from having sexual reassignment surgery has led many Malaysians to travel to Thailand for surgery. While the current case is the first legal challenge to the law that bans men from dressing as women, several other Malaysians who were born male have sought to be legally declared women. Last year, a court in Terengganu State rejected an application by a 26-year-old man to be legally declared a woman. Horley Isaacs, a lawyer, said the court rejected the application of Mohammad Ashraf Hafiz Abdul Aziz to change her name to Aleesha Farhana Abdul Aziz, on the basis that ''since she didn't have a womb she doesn't qualify to be a woman.'' Ms. Aleesha, as his client was known, died about a month after the verdict. The local news media gave the cause as heart problems, but Mr. Isaacs said he had been unable to obtain a copy of the death certificate from the hospital. ''All she asked me was 'please give me a chance to live,''' said Mr. Isaacs. He said that although several similar court applications had failed, in 2005 a Kuala Lumpur court allowed a man who was not a Muslim to change his identity to female on his identification card. Aston Paiva, the lawyer representing the four in the judicial review, said that if the court finds in their favor, it would mean that they, and other transgenders in Negri Sembilan, could no longer be arrested for dressing as women. Mr. Paiva said the decision could have implications beyond Negri Sembilan because transgender people arrested in other states could use the verdict to argue their case. Despite the Islamic law prohibiting her from dressing as a woman, the 26-year-old from Seremban says she remains a practicing Muslim. She fasts during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and sometimes visits the mosque, where she wears men's clothing. She said while she knows that, according to Islam, men should not dress as women, ''this is something that is in me. This is how I feel.''",2012,"Malaysia"
"138","Transgender Malaysians Challenge Religious Laws","Asia","SEREMBAN, MALAYSIA -- The feminine figure dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, makeup carefully applied, drew little attention from other customers at the fast-food restaurant in Seremban, a city about an hour's drive south of Kuala Lumpur. The 26-year-old began wearing women's clothing at age 13. Thanks to plastic surgery in neighboring Thailand, a daily dose of hormones and a feminine nickname, she is able to present herself as female to the outside world. But her official identification card -- which Malaysians must produce in dealings like job interviews -- declares that her name is Adam Shazrul Bin Mohammad Yusoff and that she is male. The discrepancy between her appearance and her officially recognized gender presents much more than just awkward moments in Malaysia, where Shariah, or Islamic law, bans Muslim men from dressing or posing as women. Penalties differ in individual states, but in Negri Sembilan, where the 26-year-old lives, convicted offenders may be sentenced to up to six months in prison, fined as much as 1,000 ringgit, about $325, or both. Tired of living in fear of prosecution, the 26-year-old -- who has been arrested twice and was once fined 900 ringgit -- and three other transgender people are challenging the law in the secular courts, arguing that it violates the Malaysian Constitution, which bans discrimination based on gender and protects freedom of expression. A verdict in their case -- the first time anyone has sought to overturn the law -- is expected next Thursday. ''It's for freedom -- to be like everybody else, to wear what we like,'' said the 26-year-old, explaining why she is taking part in the case. ''This shouldn't happen. It's an unjust law.

"139","Malaysian Sentencing Plan Criticized","Asia","KUALA LUMPUR -- A Malaysian government plan to make prison mandatory for men convicted of raping minors drew skepticism Monday from women's groups and lawyers, who said the best response to such cases would be better education for judges. The plan to introduce tougher sentencing for those convicted of rape involving girls under the age of 16 comes after two men who had sex with young girls avoided jail terms, prompting outrage from women's and children's activists. In Malaysia, statutory rape -- defined as cases where a man has sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16, with or without her consent -- is punishable by a minimum of 5 years and as many as 20 years in prison and whipping. However, judges have the discretion not to sentence first-time offenders to prison. A government spokesman confirmed Monday that the government planned to offer an amendment in Parliament next year to the Criminal Procedure Code that would make it mandatory for judges to impose a prison term for anyone convicted of statutory rape. Nazri Aziz, the government minister responsible for legal affairs, had been quoted in a local news report Sunday as saying that the government intended to propose changes to the law that would remove judges' sentencing discretion in rape cases where victims were below 16. In August, a national tenpin bowler who had pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl when he was 19 was released on a good-behavior bond after he appealed a five-year sentence. Later the same month, another judge granted a good-behavior bond to a man convicted of raping his 12-year-old girlfriend when he was 21. Women's groups had expressed concern that judges in the two cases had noted the offenders' potential for a bright future. But Smita Elena Sharma, a program officer at the All Women's Action Society in Kuala Lumpur, said Monday that the move to introduce mandatory prison sentences for those convicted of statutory rape was ''hasty and ill-considered.'' Instead, she said, ''clear and strict'' sentencing guidelines should be introduced and the government should provide regular training for judges and lawyers on ''gender sensitization and on the nature of consent and rape.'' Maria Chin Abdullah, executive director of Empower, another women's rights group, said that the cases involving the two men who avoided jail terms in August were ''clearly'' cases of statutory rape because they had involved girls under 16. However, she said the government should better educate the judiciary and the police instead of introducing mandatory sentencing. Lim Chee Wee, president of the Malaysian Bar Council, said the council opposed any form of mandatory sentencing because no two cases were identical. He said that under the proposed changes, judges would have no choice but to sentence a man convicted of having sex with a girl under the age of 16 to a minimum of five years in prison and whipping, regardless of the circumstances. ''What if an 18-year-old man has sexual intercourse with a 15-years-and-11-month-old girl in a boyfriend and girlfriend relationship? Then you have a situation where the court will have no option but to impose the minimum sentence of five years and whipping,'' Mr. Lim said, adding that it would be more effective to establish a sentencing council that could propose sentencing guidelines for judges.",2012,"Malaysia"
"140","A Conversation With: Sushila Sharma, Haryana Women Commission Chief","Asia","At least thirteen rape cases have been reported in Haryana over the last 30 days -- a disturbing statistic. Perhaps even more disconcerting is the diktat that a member of  state's Khap Panchayat, or self-styled council of village heads, issued late last week, in an attempt to stem such crimes. He said girls and boys should be married by age 16 to prevent rape. Under current law, men in India can get married at 21 years and woman at 18 years.  The chairwoman of the Haryana State Commission for Women, Sushila Sharma, has been one of the most  outspoken voices from the Haryana government decrying the recent outbreak of rape and criticizing the men that commit the crimes. She spoke to India Ink on Thursday about the need for stricter punishment for rapists and the role of the Khap Panchayats in protecting citizens. What do you think of the diktat issued by a Khap Panchayat member in Haryana about reducing the marriageable age to 16 years? This is their thinking. I want to say, Do they see the age of those involved in these incidents? It is traumatic for the girl and her family. In which direction is our culture headed? Going into the 21st century doesn't simply mean just watching television or surfing the Internet. People who commit rapes are drug addicts and alcoholics. We found that when we visited the site of the incident. When their repressed emotions are ignited, their minds are blocked -- they don't consider the age of the opposite sex and perform such crimes. What is the constitutional validity of the Khap Panchayats? They have existed since pre-independence days, when we did not have a proper legal structure in the country. These groups were active in mobilizing people during the freedom movement. They were well-respected village elders. We want to know why they made such a statement. Laws exist in this country. The law will not be changed on the basis of what they say. It is not a legal body; it is a collective body, as opposed to Panchayats, which are elected. How do you explain the fact, that the Khap Panchayats often exercise vigilante justice? They don't take the law in their hands. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to support them. Why has no action been taken against the Khap Panchayats? The reason is that when personal fights and disputes are resolved in villages, no one gets to know what these groups are doing. It's only when such bigger issues come up that they get noticed. Now that we know, we will talk to them. The number of rape cases is on the rise in Haryana. What would you say is the reason? The media is more aware and reporting more on the issue. And women are also coming out and reporting about these cases. I think the youth are going astray. Our youth is our power. And if power is misused then there is problem. The society stands on the shoulders of women, and the youth need to be sensitized about that. Our girls are doing so well in the field of education, science and everywhere. We should not get pessimistic when such things happen. What can be done to improve the situation? There is need for strict punishment. A girl who suffers the trauma of rape is socially ostracized. She leads a life where she is neither dead nor alive. A person who commits rape, even if he gets punishment, after getting out from jail he threatens and harasses the girl's family. He should also be ostracized for his actions. The agony of the girl should be felt by him. What is specifically being done to make women feel safer in your state? There is no quick-fix solution. We are trying to change the thinking of the youth by organizing empowerment programs in colleges and universities. We are aware that women of all ages are being harassed, not only in villages but everywhere. Women need to be empowered mentally and physically as well. In schools we are trying to teach girls karate. If a man commits rape, his mother, being a woman, should come out and condemn his actions and not support him. A woman should respect another woman. I have always said this: It is very easy to become parents, but it is very difficult to ensure that your child grows with the right kind of thinking and values. You recently said that rapists should be castrated. Wasn't that an extreme statement? The girl who was raped in Sacha Khera [in Jind] killed herself after the incident. How do you feel about that? I don't think it was an extreme statement. They need to feel the pain of a woman. (The interview was translated from Hindi, and has been lightly edited.)",2012,"India"
"141","Women in Prison Fare Better in China","Asia","BEIJING -- Shackling during childbirth? Wang Jinling sounds horrified when asked whether it happens in Chinese prisons, as it does in prisons in the United States. ''Really!'' said Ms. Wang, one of China's leading researchers on women in prison, in a telephone interview from Hangzhou, where she heads the Institute of Sociology at the Zhejiang Academy of Social Sciences. ''That's just very, ah, very cruel. I've actually never heard of shackling a woman who is giving birth. It's not done here. Well, America can learn from China on this.'' Others agree, such as John Kamm, the executive director of the Dui Hua Foundation, an advocacy group pushing for human rights improvements in China. How women are treated in prison is a neglected topic worldwide, but fast-growing female prison populations mean that governments and international organizations must address the problem, said Mr. Kamm, speaking by telephone from San Francisco. With new amendments to female prisoners' rights about to be introduced, China appeared to be doing well, though Mr. Kamm cautioned that far more needed to be known about conditions on the ground. Often, in China, laws look good on paper, but enforcement is, at best, patchy. ''The fact that only 16 states in the U.S. have outlawed shackling is a national disgrace,'' said Mr. Kamm, referring to the lawful practice in some U.S. prisons of chaining a woman's hands and ankles, before, after and sometimes during childbirth, on the grounds that a birthing inmate may try to flee. Compared with that, amendments to China's Criminal Procedure Law, due to take effect Jan. 1, are ''progressive,'' Mr. Kamm said. Essentially, these amendments mean that pregnant or breast-feeding women may be released on bail. Women serving life sentences who are pregnant or breast-feeding may temporarily serve outside prison (previously only possible for those serving fixed terms). Women who are the sole caregivers of dependents like young children may be released from jail into ''residential surveillance.'' And female law enforcement officials must be present when young women are interrogated as suspects or witnesses. The moves are urgently needed, campaigners say. In the United States and in China, women now account for about 9 percent and 6 percent of inmates, respectively, Mr. Kamm estimated. Fast-paced social change and urbanization are factors in China, with Ms. Wang estimating that about 70 percent of women in Chinese prisons are ''secondary criminals'' who have aided men in crimes like trafficking in women and children or organizing prostitution. Domestic violence is also a major reason for women's incarceration, both said. ''As tension in society grows, and it really is growing, men take it out on the women,'' said Mr. Kamm, adding that increasingly, women were fighting back. In the United States, narcotics offenses are a leading cause of female imprisonment, he said. Ms. Wang estimated China's female prison population at 4 to 5 percent of the total, but she cautioned that she did not have exact figures, with so much about China's prison system a secret. And Mr. Kamm also noted that the new clauses did not apply to women in China's large system of re-education through labor, or ''laojiao,'' an extrajudicial form of detention that snares many thousands every year. ''I don't see anything in this law that helps women in laojiao,'' he said. Facing rising numbers, pressure is growing to better manage women's needs in prison, advocates say. They point to the ''Bangkok Rules,'' adopted by the United Nations in 2010, as an important step. Formally known as the United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders, the agreement calls for a range of improvements, including recording new inmates' experiences of sexual abuse before entering prison and providing more water for washing, especially for menstruating women. Ms. Wang says China already does the latter. In fact, she said, in China's paternalistic system, jailed women have better conditions than men. ''The government has a way of protecting women that's traditional,'' she said. ''For example they have more hot water to wash themselves, their lower bodies. There are fewer people in each room, about four to six or six to eight, while the men are, say, six to eight or 10,'' she said. ''They get more space to keep personal possessions,'' she added. When the police arrest a woman who is pregnant, ''she cannot be sent to prison. She doesn't go into detention either,'' said Ms. Wang. ''Generally she stays at home and is monitored in her district. Depending on the severity of her crime, she is either monitored by the police or by other local officials.'' When it's time to give birth, ''if, say, she committed murder, then a policeman will accompany her to the hospital and make notes. But if not, then not.'' ''Actually, the biggest headache for the police on this is that you can't jail a pregnant woman, say a thief, even if she's a repeat offender,'' she said. Formerly, a female criminal was jailed immediately after giving birth, said Ms. Wang. Now, she is ''usually allowed to 'zuo yuezi''' -- a traditional month in bed together with the infant, recovering and nursing. ''Then she goes in,'' she said. The new legal provisions reinforce those practices, said Ms. Wang. ''The amended Criminal Procedure Law is definitely better than the old one in terms of rights for women,'' she said. Importantly, rights-based language is replacing paternalistic concepts, she said. ''There has been a change recently in the language being used by officials, advocates and law drafters,'' Ms. Wang said. ''They don't say, 'We're protecting women.' They say, 'Women have rights.' Yes, it's happening, slowly. The idea of rights. Slowly, that concept is growing.''",2012,"China"

"143","The Breakfast Meeting: Guilty Verdicts in Pussy Riot Case, and China's Media Strategy","Asia","10:59 a.m. | Updated Three members of the Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot were found guilty on Friday over a stunt they staged in February against Vladimir V. Putin in the main Moscow Russian Orthodox cathedral, David Herszenhorn reports. The scene in hot, overcrowded courtroom with the three women behind bulletproof glass was being streamed live by Russia Today, fueling worldwide interest in the prosecution of the band members, who have received support from musicians around the world including Paul McCartney and Madonna. The judge sentenced each to a two-year prison sentence. The YouTube video of the incident is at nearly 450,000 views.  China's inroads into Africa started with assistance in large construction projects, but lately have been enhanced by a pervasive media strategy, Andrew Jacobs reports. In Kenya, for example, there are two China-based TV networks and a radio station, while articles and photographs from its news agency Xinhua appear in popular English-language newspapers. In many ways, China is following a Western template, hoping to bolster its image and influence around the world, particularly in regions rich in the natural resources.

Executives at Time Warner Cable have viewed the channel as too costly for what they consider little more than a package of football games.

"144","From India, Pressure on Ireland Over Abortion Laws","Asia","The death of an Indian woman in Ireland who was reportedly refused a potentially lifesaving abortion has rekindled the debate on abortion laws in the predominantly Catholic nation and has sparked outrage in India. ""We are shocked that such a death was allowed to take place in this day and age,"" said Sudha Sundararaman, the general secretary of the All India Democratic Women's Association, by telephone. ""We lost a life that could have been saved by medical intervention because of a religion-based law that goes completely against international laws."" Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old dentist who lived near Galway, Ireland, was 17 weeks pregnant when she was informed, on complaining of severe back pain, that she was having a miscarriage. Despite repeated requests for an abortion, she was told that Ireland is a Catholic country, said her husband, Praveen Halappanavar, and that it would be illegal to terminate a pregnancy while the fetus's heart was still beating. A few days later, Dr. Halappanavar died of septicemia on Oct. 28 at the University Hospital Galway. Protesters took to the streets of Ireland and New Delhi, raising banners and chanting slogans, in response to Dr. Halappanavar's death, which many blamed on Ireland's abortion laws, among the most restrictive in the world. ""I don't think as a country we should allow a situation where women's rights are put at risk in this way,"" Eamon Gilmore, Ireland's deputy prime minister, told Parliament on Thursday. ""There is no question of equivocation. We need to bring legal clarity to this issue, and that is what we are going to do."" Two inquiries have been set up to determine the cause of Dr. Halappanavar's death. On Friday, the Indian government too stepped in, promising to take up the matter with the Irish. ""It is a sad issue,"" said the foreign minister, Salman Khurshid, in a televised interview. ""They have a legal framework that is rooted in religion. But there can't be a bigger goal in religion than to save the life of a mother."" In a meeting on Friday afternoon, M. Ganapathi, a secretary in the ministry of external affairs, conveyed to the Irish ambassador to India, Feilim McLaughlin, that ""there is a sense of angst in India caused by the fact that a life was cut short in its prime,"" Syed Akbaruddin, the official spokesman for the external affairs ministry, said. The government of India expressed hope that the probe would be thorough and independent, Mr. Akbaruddin said. It was also conveyed, he said, that ""we hope no other Indian meets the same fate."" The Indian ambassador to Ireland also met with the Irish foreign minister on Friday. India will request that the Irish authorities share the results of the investigations. ""We are taking one step at a time,"" said Mr. Akbaruddin. ""We want to first understand what the circumstances of the death were."" But activists in India say there needs to be more action. ""Minority and immigrant communities should lead a movement to protect their interests in the countries of their residence,"" said Kirti Singh, an advocate in Delhi who works on issues of women's rights. The Indian government should also register a protest with the Irish authorities, she said, since an Indian did not receive adequate care from their medical system. ""What happened was in violation of international law and our national laws,"" she said. The international position, she explained, is that a woman must have the right to an abortion if there is danger to her life. India's abortion law, which was passed in 1972 and is broader in scope, allows abortions in several circumstances, including when the life of the mother is at risk, where rape is involved and even when contraception fails. Ms. Singh advocates expanding abortion rights even further, arguing that women shouldn't have to justify their decision to end their pregnancies. ""When we are fighting for broader rights in India, how can we allow something like this to happen?"" she said. Ireland's laws place a near ban on abortion, a fraught and emotive social issue in that country. In 1992, in what is known as the ""X-case"" involving a 14-year-old rape victim, the Supreme Court ruled that abortions would be allowed when there was a ""real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother."" Since then, successive governments, reluctant to stir the pot on an issue that could alienate conservative voters, have dragged their feet on legislation that would lay down precisely the circumstances in which an abortion would be legal. As a result, thousands of women seeking to terminate their pregnancies travel to nearby England and Wales, which have less stringent abortion laws. Whether or not Dr. Halappanavar's case induces a change in Ireland's legal system, many in India say that Dr. Halappanavar's family and the Indian government must demand justice. ""If the investigation shows that the death was a consequence of the law, then we need to fight at the international level,"" said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, an Indian parliamentarian. ""Someone has lost their life. There must be accountability."" This idea is not without precedent. In 2010, the European Court of Human Rights heard the case of a woman from Lithuania who was in remission from cancer and believed that there was a risk that her pregnancy would cause a relapse. She was also concerned about a risk to the fetus if she carried it to term. Unable to get an abortion in Ireland, she decided to have one in England. She argued that by denying her an abortion, Ireland had violated her human rights by putting her life at risk. The court ordered Ireland to pay 15,000 euros ($19,000) in damages to the woman.",2012,"India"
"145","A Merry Band of Rights Pranksters","Asia","BEIJING -- They call themselves the Volunteers -- a growing band of young Chinese who stage playful, but pointed, public protests for greater rights for women. They dance and sing on the street wearing oversize ''underpants'' to assail invasive gynecological examinations for female civil servants, stroll through shopping precincts in bridal gowns spattered with red paint to combat domestic violence and shave off their hair in protest at higher university admissions standards for women. And while their style is somewhat more subtle than that of Pussy Riot, Russia's feminist punk collective, it hits home in a country where politics is conducted behind closed doors by men in look-alike dark suits. Against the secrecy and uniformity, the Volunteers' ''happenings'' are a flash of color. ''We choose this wild and happy style because if we dance and sing, people pay attention,'' said one Volunteer who asked that she be identified by the name she uses widely online, Zhu Xixi, because the group's actions are risky in a country where the authorities are quick to crack down on public protests. ''We want to be spirited and positive. And it works,'' said Ms. Zhu, who plans to take up postgraduate studies. ''We want to show we are not victims. If we were too serious, we would scare people off.'' The women, and a few men, are mostly well educated, in their early or mid-20s. While Ms. Zhu wasn't sure how many Volunteers there were, she said they were in every major city. ''And I think people are watching in every area of the country,'' she said. ''I think the movement will grow.'' There are certainly scores -- perhaps hundreds. Many are students, often specializing in law or sociology, Ms. Zhu said. They are not highly organized, instead relying on social media and word of mouth to stage an event. They are goaded on by entrenched gender discrimination, long visible in politics and elsewhere, several said in interviews over the last few months. That discrimination just got worse. When the 18th National Congress of the ruling Communist Party appointed the country's new leaders last month, the number of women in top positions not only failed to grow, but actually shrank. The number of women on the party's new, 205-person Central Committee fell to 10 from 13, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. Women now make up just 4.9 percent of members. On the new Politburo, the 25-member body above the Central Committee, there are two women -- one more than before. But the only woman with any chance of moving onto the most powerful body, the Politburo's seven-member Standing Committee, Liu Yandong, failed to make the final selection. She remains on the Politburo, joined by Sun Chunlan, the only female party leader for any of China's 33 provinces and administrative districts, who has been appointed party secretary of Tianjin. Ms. Liu, despite her solid credentials, was never going to make it into the inner circle of power, said a researcher at a central government institute with professional and personal ties to her. He requested that his name not be used for fear of the impact on his career. ''The Politburo is as high as a woman gets,'' he said. The Volunteers say they were struck by the contrast between the situation of women here and the gains women made in elections last month in the United States, where there will be more women than before in Congress -- 20 of 100 in the Senate, and 78 of 435 in the House of Representatives. So expect more protests in 2013, probably involving costumes, singing and synchronized dancing. Days after a protest in which Ms. Zhu took part in the city of Wuhan, against requirements that women applying for civil service jobs undergo rigorous gynecological examinations and answer detailed questions about their menstrual cycles, another set of protests were staged in five other cities. On Dec. 2, in Dongguan, Guangzhou, Xian, Hangzhou and Shanghai, women reprised the ''Injured Brides'' protest of Beijing last February, donning bridal gowns spattered with ''blood'' and holding up placards saying: ''Love is not an excuse for violence,'' part of a campaign for a law against domestic violence that has been debated for years but is not making visible progress. Earlier this year, too, Volunteers attracted widespread media attention with their protests at public toilets in Guangzhou and other cities, saying women needed more facilities. In August, Volunteers danced to a song they wrote, ''Violence Is Intolerable,'' in front of a Beijing courtroom where Kim Lee, a U.S. citizen, was seeking to divorce her Chinese husband, who had admitted physically abusing her. They carried a letter with 1,000 signatures calling for justice for Ms. Lee. The lyrics weren't Pussy Riot punk, but in China their appeal to Confucian-style moral rectitude resonated: Crazy violence reverberates through the country. Public apology has no sincerity at all. Repeated violence forces Kim to leave. Domestic violence should be severely punished. Dad, why are you beating Mom? Is it really all right to hurt her? Mom gets hurt, and we are so scared. We just want a happy and lovely home.",2012,"China"
"146","Indian Women March: 'That Girl Could Have Been Any One of Us'","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Neha Kaul Mehra says she was only 7 years old the first time she was sexually harassed. She was walking to a dance class in an affluent neighborhood of New Delhi when a man confronted her and began openly masturbating. That episode was far from the last. Years of verbal and physical sexual affronts left Ms. Mehra, now 29, filled with what she described as ''impotent rage.'' Last week, she and thousands of Indian women like her poured that anger into public demonstrations, reacting to news of the gang rape of another young woman who had moved to the city from a small village, with a new life in front of her. That woman, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, died Saturday from internal injuries inflicted with a metal rod during the rape, which took place on a bus two weeks ago. In her story and its brutal ending, many women in the world's largest democracy say they see themselves. ''That girl could have been any one of us,'' said Sangeetha Saini, 44, who took her two teenage daughters to a candle-filled demonstration on Sunday in Delhi. Women in India ''face harassment in public spaces, streets, on buses,'' she said. ''We can only tackle this by becoming Durga,'' she added, referring to the female Hindu god who slays a demon. Indian women have made impressive gains in recent years: maternal mortality rates have dropped, literacy rates and education levels have risen, and millions of women have joined the professional classes. But the women at the heart of the protest movement say it was born of their outraged realization that no matter how accomplished they become, or how hard they work, women here will never fully take part in the promise of a new and more prosperous India unless something fundamental about the culture changes. Indeed, many women in India say they are still subject to regular harassment and assault during the day and are fearful of leaving their homes alone after dark. Now they are demanding that the government, and a police force that they say offers women little or no protection, do something about it. Ankita Cheerakathil, 20, a student at St. Stephen's College who attended a protest on Thursday, remembered dreading the daily bus ride when she was in high school in the southern state of Kerala. Before she stepped outside her house, she recalled, she would scrutinize herself in a mirror, checking to see whether her blouse was too tight. At the bus stop, inevitably, men would zero in on the schoolgirls in their uniforms, some as young as 10, to leer and make cracks filled with sexual innuendo. ''This is not an isolated incident,'' Ms. Cheerakathil said of the death of the New Delhi rape victim. ''This is the story of every Indian woman.'' While the Dec. 16 attack was extreme in its savagery, gang rapes of women have been happening with frightening regularity in recent months, particularly in northern India. Critics say the response from a mostly male police force is often inadequate at best. Last week, an 18-year-old woman in Punjab State committed suicide by drinking poison after being raped by two men and then humiliated by male police officers, who made her describe her attack in detail several times, then tried to encourage her to marry one of her rapists. Dozens more gang rapes have been reported in the states of Haryana, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in recent months. The government does not keep statistics on gang rape, but over all, rapes increased 25 percent from 2006 to 2011. More than 600 rapes were reported in New Delhi alone in 2012. So far, only one attack has resulted in a conviction. Sociologists and crime experts say the attacks are the result of deeply entrenched misogynistic attitudes and the rising visibility of women, underpinned by long-term demographic trends in India. After years of aborting female fetuses, a practice that is still on the rise in some areas because of a cultural preference for male children, India has about 15 million ''extra'' men between the ages of 15 and 35, the range when men are most likely to commit crimes. By 2020, those ''extra'' men will have doubled to 30 million. ''There is a strong correlation between masculinized sex ratios and higher rates of violent crime against women,'' said Valerie M. Hudson, a co-author of ''Bare Branches: The Security Implications of Asia's Surplus Male Population.'' Men who do not have wives and families often gather in packs, Ms. Hudson argues, and then commit more gruesome and violent crimes than they would on their own. Others point to the gains that women have made as triggers for an increase in violent crimes. ''Women are rising in society and fighting for equal space, and these crimes are almost like a backlash,'' said Vijay Raghavan, chairman of the Center for Criminology and Justice at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai. If poverty and unemployment were the only reason for these crimes, rates would already be much higher, he said, because both are constants in India. In India's conservative society, male sexual aggression is portrayed in unexpected ways. In Bollywood films, kissing on screen is still rare and nudity forbidden. But the rape scene has been a staple of movies for decades. And depictions of harassment often have an innocent woman resisting nobly, but eventually succumbing to the male hero. One commonly used term for sexual harassment is ''eve-teasing,'' which critics say implies the act is gentle and harmless. The New Delhi rape victim, whose funeral was held on Sunday, and whose name had not been revealed, was from a small village in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state. Her journey to Delhi was the same that thousands of young women make every year to big cities around the country, in search of a better education and opportunities than their parents had. ''My brother's entire salary was spent on educating his children so that their aspirations were fulfilled,'' the woman's uncle told the newspaper The Hindu. In South Delhi, hundreds of students from Jawaharlal Nehru University organized a silent march from their campus to Munirka, the bus stop where the rape victim was picked up, after her death became public on Saturday. The crowd of protesters trudged along a busy road, a few holding hastily made placards with phrases like ''You are an inspiration to us all.'' ''There's a movement that has been built out of this,'' said Ruchira Sen, 25, a student of economics on the march to Munirka. ''We are going to do everything it takes to make it last,'' she said. Students and activist groups have presented a list of demands to the government, including the fast-tracking of rape cases through India's courts and improved training for the police. Part of the policing problem is that less than 4 percent of India's overall force is female, said Suman Nalwa, head of Delhi's special unit for women, in an interview. She said she was working to improve police response to sexual assault. ''Earlier, women didn't leave their homes, so there was no crime,'' Ms. Nalwa said. ''We are doing our best, but, of course, there is a lot more to be done.'' Like many who attended these protests and rallies, Ms. Mehra had been urged to go by her mother, who she said had given this reason: ''Because I don't want my granddaughter to face this.'' Men have also been a large presence at the protests, though not always a positive one. After the large central Delhi protests on Dec. 22 and 23, the police received 42 complaints from women about men's behavior there, said a senior police officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was not public. He balked at describing the actions as ''harassment'' or ''molestation,'' saying that implied aggravated or sustained behavior. Instead, he said, the men were merely ''eve-teasing.''",2012,"India"
"147","Are Delhi's Buses Safe For Women?","Asia","If you're a woman, you're not safe on public buses in Delhi. If you get raped, it's probably your fault. That's what Delhi's public transport riders had to say Monday afternoon, when asked about yet-another heinous crime against a woman in north India - this time, it was a 23-year-old woman, who was riding a bus when she was gang-raped by four men on Sunday night. The woman had boarded a chartered bus, one of the many private bus networks that ply Delhi, with a 28-year-old male friend in Munirka, a south Delhi neighborhood. While on the bus, she was raped by four men, according to the police. When the woman's friend tried to defend her, he was beaten with an iron rod. The two were than stripped of their clothing and thrown off the bus onto a national highway. The woman is now in critical condition, hospital officials said Monday. ""It's the girl's weakness in most cases,"" said Ram Singh, a portly middle-aged man who was messily chewing tobacco while waiting at the Connaught Place bus stop in Delhi. ""They become friends and then they fight. Sudden, unknown attacks are usually a minority of the cases. In most cases, it's the girl's fault,"" he said.  His views were echoed by most other men waiting for the bus. Another passenger at the crowded bus stop, Mohan Bharat, 60, a retired corporate employee, said he believed that the law is fundamentally weak in Delhi. ""Ten years ago, Delhi was worse then the smallest of cities,"" he said. ""This is a result of the impotence of the government. Everything is left loose in the name of freedom."" Chhaya Sharma, the deputy police commissioner for Delhi, emphasized at a news conference on Monday that the bus was not a regular public bus. Ms. Sharma said the victims got on the off-duty chartered bus when the driver called out to them, saying he could go to the Palam or Dwarka areas. In a rush to get home, the woman and her friend each paid the 10 rupee fare (20 U.S. cents) and boarded the bus. A quarrel ensued between a few men who were already seated on the bus and the two new passengers, after which the young woman was raped and the man beaten up. The two were then ""dumped"" by Mahipalpur on National Highway 8, she said. Ms. Sharma appealed to the public to help identify the bus using the CCTV footage the police have. ""We are following up on the leads we have, and I would like to assure you that we are trying to crack this case as soon as possible."" Delhi's public bus system is used by nearly 7 million people a day, according to government figures. As of 2010, about 50 percent of the buses were government run buses and 40 percent private buses.  While the breakdown between male and female passengers is not available, women are clearly a small minority. That's because buses, whether public or private, are not friendly to women, female riders say. Remnants of a rusted sign asking passengers to reserve seats for women could be spotted on a public Delhi Transport Corporation bus that stopped in Connaught Place on Monday. ""Most of these signs are usually ripped off,"" says Manju, 45, a female passenger who was getting off the green-line bus. ""My daughter, who is in 11th grade, for the lack of anything else, takes the bus from our house to her school every day. Every day, I live in tension and anxiety until she gets home."" When girls are teased or groped on buses and they report it to their parents, their parents usually blame the girl by saying ""she probably smiled or brought it upon herself,"" said Ms. Manju, who declined to give her last name. Delhi needs to start running women-only buses to alleviate the problem, she said. A few years ago, a Delhi-based nongovernment organization, Jagori, mapped the safety of women in public spaces in the city. In its survey, 80 percent of the 500 female respondents reported they had faced sexual harassment in buses and other public transport. Many women in Delhi avoid the buses altogether. ""Never. I've never traveled on buses,"" said Smriti Sharma, 20, who was standing outside the Khan Market Metro station. ""My friends who take the bus tell me that buses are usually not safe -- they molest you, they grab you. Because the buses are always crowded, there are always chances."" In Mumbai, where she lived earlier, Ms. Sharma said she traveled by bus in the hours from 12:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m., and it was ""absolutely safe."" She may have been the only woman on the bus, she said, but no one harassed her. ""There were men, they were looking at me, but they wouldn't dare touch me,"" she said. ""Not even a comment."" The Delhi Metro system, which has women-only compartments, is considered much safer for women. Stations are manned by India's Central Industrial Security Force, a national guard, and outfitted with CCTV security cameras, metal detectors, x-ray machines. ""You can't rape anybody in the Metro,"" said Mohit Chowdhary, 21, who was standing with Ms. Sharma. ""There are cameras everywhere,"" he said, and women can hit an emergency button in compartments to call for help. Ms. Sharma said that the lack of safety on buses is due to women's behavior, demeanor or dress, or even the lack of women's-only buses. ""It's the men here,"" she said. ""The problem is with the men here.""",2012,"India"
"148","Indians Outraged Over Rape on Moving Bus in New Delhi","Asia","The police said the men were looking for some fun. They had been drinking, having a party, and decided to go on a joy ride. They began circling the capital in a private bus, the police said, when they spotted a couple looking for a ride home. They waved the man and woman onboard and charged them each 36 cents. And then, the police said, the men beat the couple with an iron rod and repeatedly raped the woman as the bus circled the city. The woman suffered severe injuries to her head and intestines and required multiple operations, local news media reported, indicators of an assault so savage that India's capital on Tuesday was shaking with public outrage. Protesters encircled a local police station and blocked a major highway. India's Parliament erupted in angry protests and condemnation. ""A terrible, terrible atrocity has happened,"" Renuka Chowdhury, a member of Parliament, said Tuesday during a raucous session in the upper house. ""I am not going to allow this incident to become another statistic."" Sushma Swaraj, the leader of the opposition in the lower house, demanded that the death penalty be imposed for rapists. ""She will live her whole life as a living corpse if she survives,"" Ms. Swaraj said of the victim. ""Why should there not be the death penalty in such a case?"" Horrific cases of violence against women seem to happen with disturbing regularity, many of them occurring in the national capital, now often described in the media as India's rape capital. In one highly publicized case in September, a 16-year-old girl in the neighboring state of Haryana was raped repeatedly by a group of eight men, perhaps more, who recorded the assault on their cellphones and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. But the family came forward after the videos circulated and her father killed himself by drinking pesticide. The New Delhi attack occurred on Sunday evening, in the southern rim of the capital. The woman, a 23-year-old medical student, had been out with a male friend; Indian news media reported that they had seen a film together. It was about 9:10, and the police said the couple were trying to find a ride to a city neighborhood known as Palam. A bus pulled over, and they boarded. New Delhi has a mix of public and private buses serving more than seven million people every day. The police said the man and woman were tricked into believing that the bus was part of the city's public fleet: one of the suspects was posing as a conductor, calling out for passengers. Instead, the bus was part of a fleet owned by a private charter company. One of the suspects worked for the company by day, driving a bus for a private school. As the bus began moving, three young men confronted the couple and began harassing the woman, the police said. Her friend tried to intervene, but they beat him with an iron rod and then repeatedly raped the woman, the police said. Eventually, the two were stripped of their clothing and thrown out of the bus onto a national highway on the southern outskirts of the capital. In a briefing on Tuesday afternoon, the Delhi police commissioner, Neeraj Kumar, said the suspects had taken the bus after an evening of drinking and eating. ""The idea was to have fun,"" he said. The police said they had arrested four of the six suspects in the case, based on evidence from closed-circuit surveillance cameras. The commissioner said the courts would be asked to ""fast track"" the case, while prosecutors are expected to seek the maximum sentence of life in prison. The woman is being treated at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi, and regained consciousness on Tuesday, local media reported. She is communicating through writing. Across New Delhi on Tuesday, women's groups and students organized protests to demand better security, at one point shutting down the city's outer ring road, a major route. Several hundred other protesters gathered around the police station where the complaint was filed, holding placards and chanting slogans. ""This is an expression of our horror and anger and discontent at how things are,"" said Komal, a doctoral student at Jawaharlal Nehru University who asked to be identified only by her first name. ""The government has to take responsibility."" She said she regularly took buses and often felt unsafe traveling in the capital region. Being sexually harassed is an ""everyday experience,"" she said. Women are constantly followed by men and groped while on public transportation, she said. Anupama Ramakrishnan, 33, who is studying sociology at Delhi University, blamed what she called ""a deeply held sense of patriarchy"" for the attack. ""This is not about sexuality,"" she said. ""It is about power and violence."" New Delhi has one of the highest reported rates of crime against women in India, though most experts believe that the official numbers barely hint at the real scale of the problem. Nearly 600 rapes were reported last year, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, more than the reports from Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore combined. This year, the capital has already recorded more than 600 rapes and may set a record. In northern India, reports of rape are often followed by questions about the victim's behavior, and even accusations that she provoked the assault. On Tuesday, some of India's most prominent activists and social commentators took to Twitter to voice their opinions. ""Security in mobility for a woman is the first right she needs to be guaranteed!"" wrote Kiran Bedi, once one of India's highest-ranking female police officers. ""Failure to ensure this is clear failure of governance!"" Hari Kumar contributed reporting.",2012,"India"

Despite the anger over the recent, brutal gang-rape of a 23-year-old by a group of six men, who also beat up her male friend, protests over women's violence in the Capital have been relatively small. But the crowds walking up the Hill, towards the government offices of North and South Block, from India Gate are unusual. It's a young crowd-students, young men and women in their twenties, a smattering of slightly older women there to show their solidarity, and it's a large crowd, about a thousand strong at the Hill itself.

"151","After Delhi Rape Victim Leaves India, Questions Raised About Media's Role","Asia","On Wednesday night, the entrance of Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi resembled a carnival, overrun with police officers, eager journalists and curious passersby.   At least two dozen television news vans were staked outside, awaiting the latest word on the condition of the 23-year-old woman who was gang-raped on a Delhi bus last week. Reporters gave on-camera analysis and competed for snippets of ""exclusive"" news from the hospital authorities, while drivers stopped to gawk at the spectacle. Inside, security officers guarded the premises like a fortress.  At 10:30 p.m., the woman departed the hospital for the airport, to be flown to Singapore for further treatment; she left Safdarjung in a procession consisting of three ambulances, as many police vans and multiple police cars, with dozens of television vans not far behind. The Indian news media's coverage of the Delhi gang rape and its aftermath has started to resemble the kind of play-by-play commentary once seen only in cricket matches, with a focus on the short-term and the sensational that is drawing criticism from many quarters. On his Facebook page, actor Amitabh Bachchan wrote ""Ethics be damned !!,"" and cited a story of a journalist who once came to his hospital room dressed as a doctor. Noopor Tiwari, a journalist based in Paris, writes that in concentrating on stories like the Delhi gang rape,  the Indian media risk making other, more common forms of rape, such as acquaintance rape or marital rape, seem less serious. The Indian Express argued in an editorial that the nonstop coverage was breeding ""bloodlust"" in Delhi, saying that the recent protests in the capital had been ""amplified and primed up hysterically by the electronic media."" Unlike in many previous high-profile rape cases, the media (and the police) have not made the victim's name public. But critics say the coverage has not only been incendiary but has, yet again, painted a rape victim as a shamed woman. Activists from women's groups say it is important to speak of rape not as the ruination of a life, but as a horrific act that one can survive and move on from. ""There is this tendency to equate rape with the end of the girl's life, which sends a very counterproductive message,"" said Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. ""The media tend to refer to the girl as a victim - I believe that rape is an act of extreme physical violence from which one is a survivor and not a victim."" The woman has been dubbed ""Damini"" by protesters and on social networking sites, after a Hindi film about a woman's struggle for justice for a rape survivor. Another survivor of the attack last week, a male, 28-year-old software engineer who, like the woman, was beaten and thrown out of the moving bus, has also been hounded by reporters, but is said to have been so traumatized by the incident that his father is taking him to their hometown in Uttar Pradesh to recover. On Thursday morning the 23-year-old was admitted to Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, which specializes in multi-organ transplant. The woman suffered severe injuries during the attack; at Safdarjung she underwent three abdominal operations and experienced a cardiac arrest. On Thursday evening Kelvin Loh, the chief executive of the hospital said in a statement that the patient is still in extremely critical condition and was being treated at the hospital's Intensive Care Unit. ""A multi-disciplinary team of specialists is taking care of her and doing everything possible to stabilize her condition,"" he said. Earlier today, a hospital official told the Press Trust of India, ""We request that the privacy of the patient and family be respected.""

"152","Delhi Police Deploy Mimes Against Sexual Assault","Asia","How well Delhi's police protect women, particularly from sexual attacks, has become an increasingly politicized issue after the Dec. 16 gang rape of a medical student on a moving bus. Protesters outraged over the crime, and the rise in reported rape cases in the city, have been calling for Delhi's police commissioner, Neeraj Kumar, to step down. In 2005, the Delhi police created the Parivartan (""Change"") program to increase awareness about women's safety in the nation's capital in response to several sexual attacks. India Ink recently took a look at the Parivartan program to learn more about how Delhi's police are trying to fight the problem of violence against women. From the Ashok Vihar police station in West Delhi, Usha Sanghwan, an inspector, has run Parivartan for the past year. Her job includes sending female constables door to door in slum areas, talking about sexual violence with elders in the community and gathering information on reports of domestic and sexual violence from police-appointed ""guardians,"" members of the community with clean records who are considered responsible. Crimes against women are prevalent in West Delhi's slum areas. ""It's not safe, even for our girls,"" Mrs. Sanghwan said in an interview. ""The men in these localities are often under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and can be extremely resistant to our efforts, if not outright violent,"" she said. Every week, constables and junior officers head out to the lower-income areas of Jahangirpuri, in north Delhi, to talk to residents on issues like sexual violence and substance abuse. Their three-pronged intervention, Mrs. Sanghwan said, includes one-one-one interactions, film screenings on the relevant themes, and pantomimes aimed at children, performed by the Delhi-based mime theater troupe Jagran. Pantomime day is particularly popular, she said. Every fortnight in a different part of Jahangirpuri, a rickety stage is erected, usually facing blocks of makeshift shacks. A recent performance by Jagran drew a crowd of 200 children, some as young as two years old, others on the fringes of adulthood. The troupe of four men and two women painted their faces in white with black outlines, with some of them in garish silk costumes. A dholki, or drummer, accompanied them on the side. The comically attired adults were introduced to their impressionable audience by a man standing opposite the drummer. Dressed plainly, microphone in hand, he was both narrator and watchdog. The mimes typically perform three skits: the first about a young boy who falls victim to drugs, the second on the dangers women face from physically and verbally violent spouses, and the final one on the trauma of sexual abuse. During the skits, the narrator stops the action to call out questions to the children in the audience: ""Should that man have behaved in this disgusting manner?"" ""Should they have kept quiet?"" ""Should she have alerted the Delhi Police?"" Plainclothes Delhi police officers who organized the show stood by, trying to blend in with the crowd. ""We have been attempting to educate residents here,"" a constable, Abhishek Khatri, said as he watched the performance. Mr. Khatri has been with the Parivartan unit for a little more than a year. ""We can't change society, obviously,"" he said. But what the program is trying to do is ""engage with different members of society - academics, teachers, social scientists, N.G.O.'s,"" he said, about ""how to address the menace of violence and abuse."" ""We need them to know that violence and sexual abuse are common, and that there is no shame in reporting a case of assault immediately,"" he said. As he spoke, a colleague was called away to investigate a case of domestic violence in a neighboring block. ""It is quite frustrating for us,"" Mr. Khatri said, ""because there are so many reports of such violent acts, every day."" ""There's only so much that you can do and you can say to the slum-dwellers,"" he said. ""This kind of systemic violence is very hard for us to fight."" While we watched the final act of the troupe's performance, a 13-year-old boy started pulling viciously at a little girl's hair while slapping her across the face, for reasons unknown. Mr. Khatri quickly rushed over to break up the altercation, but by then the boy had disappeared. ""It takes nothing to start a fight in Delhi, you see,"" Mr. Khatri said, grimacing. ""We'll be chasing the same boy across state lines tomorrow."" Parivartan's effectiveness in the slum areas is limited, some police officials acknowledge. Those involved with the program said they have suggested that Parivartan be held in wealthier neighborhoods too, but resident associations there have dismissed the idea. The impact of these programs ""is very slow,"" said Suman Nalwa, additional deputy commissioner of the police and head of the women and children's unit, in a recent interview. ""People remain in their own social circle, where their beliefs about sexuality, their beliefs about relationships are accentuated,"" she said.",2012,"India"
"153","Protests Across India Over Death of Gang Rape Victim","Asia","Bring white roses, some suggested. Get angry, some said. Don't resort to violence, others begged. Let's not let her die in vain, they said. As India awoke Saturday to the death of a 23-year-old woman who has become a symbol of what many say all that is wrong with the way women are treated here, the country's young, social-network-savvy population sprang into action, organizing and advertising protests, candlelight vigils and marches from Cochin, Kerala, to India's outsourcing headquarters of Bangalore to Mumbai's Juhu Beach. India's Internet penetration rates are still low, and the percentage of people who have computers is miniscule. Still, the country has 60 million Facebook subscribers, a fast-growing presence on Twitter and a student population that seems to be quickly awakening to activism. The rape that occurred Dec. 16, and what is seen as the government's tin-eared response to the incident, had already galvanized this small sliver of India's 1.3 billion people to action. The victim's death Saturday morning in Singapore, of organ failure related to her injuries, seems to have pushed them further. The victim, a 23-year old physiotherapy student, was attacked by six men on a moving bus on Dec. 16 and left to die on the side of a Delhi highway. When thousands of protesters gathered in India Gate days after the attack, they were arrested, beaten with sticks and tear-gassed without, many claim, any provocation. Hoping to avoid a repeat of those incidents, the Delhi government shut all roads leading in to the area early Saturday morning, closed nearby Metro stations and deployed hundreds of police officers. Protesters began massing instead at Jantar Mantar, an ancient observatory and popular demonstration site. Despite the limits to transportation, which also included cutting down buses plying nearby routes, protesters claimed that their numbers had reached more than 500 by early afternoon, and new attendees continued to stream into the area. Here's what a few of them had to say: Kavita Krishnan, activist, All India Progressive Women's Association, who is leading protests at Jantar Mantar: ""It's time to call for mourning and for serious reflection,"" in India, and to ask ""What's wrong with our society that produces this?"" ""The government's response until now has been abysmal,"" she said, adding that top members of Parliament have made sexist remarks. ""There are no persuasive voices in government,"" she said. Although a judicial commission has been formed as a response to the crisis, and is accepting recommendations about changes in the legal system, they are not engaging with women's groups, she said. ""There are no members with experience in gender jurisprudence"" in the commission, she said. Upamanyu Raju, 21, a student at Delhi University, who was protesting at Jantar Mantar: He has been protesting since a day after the rape victim was admitted to hospital because of ""utter atrocity"" of what happened to her. ""We have to make sure we come out, and this doesn't happen again,"" he said. He wants judicial and police reforms and a stringent sexual harassment law. ""We will not leave the protests until the government takes action,"" he said. He was shocked to hear news of victim's death this morning. ""She's been our driving force for the last so many days, so it was a shock to lose her,"" he said. It will take time before society changes its attitudes towards women, he said. He added that a car full of men tried to abduct a female friend of his 6 p.m. at a busy intersection in central Delhi. ""People have become bold,"" he said. He is worried about his sister, who is 17. He's given her a Swiss Army knife and pepper spray, but worries that won't protect her, and neither can he. ""Even if she's accompanied, it doesn't help,"" he said. ""It's wrong to stop girls from going out"" he said, but says there's little choice. The government and the police appear out of touch with citizens, he said. ""They're not allowing us to protest, which is bringing out violent instincts in people,"" he said. ""The police don't seem to understand the emotions of the people."" Neha Sharma, 24, a Delhi University student from Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, who was protesting in Jantar Mantar: ""We want justice,"" she said. ""There are so many rape cases pending."" Capital punishment is not the way forward, she said. Instead, ""we need to fix the system,"" she said, but the government and police are not taking any steps to do so. She has been coming to protests over the Delhi rape case since they started. ""I come with the hope that things will change,"" she said. In South Delhi, hundreds of students from Jawaharlal Nehru University organized a silent march from their campus to Munirka, the bus stop where the Delhi rape victim was picked up. The crowd of protesters trudged along a busy road, a few holding hastily-made placards with phrases like ""You are an inspiration to us all."" Meha Thakore, 25, a sociology student at the silent march to Munirka, said: ""We expect certain demands to be met by the government,"" but she said the government is not meeting them. Echoing the thoughts of many protesters in India, Ms. Thakore said she believed that the transfer of the Delhi rape victim to a Singapore hospital was ""to divert attention and avert crisis and chaos."" Ruchira Sen, 25, a student of economics on the march to Munirka, said: ""There's a movement that has been built out of this. We are going to do everything it taken to make it last."" Students and activists groups have a list of demands they have presented to the government, she said, including the fast-tracking of rape cases through India's courts, improved training for police to handle rape cases and the dismissal of the Delhi police commissioner. Shivani Parimal, 27, a PhD scholar in German on the march to Munirka, said: ""Everything starts at home. We need to teach our sons and treat sons and daughters equally."" In Bangalore, several candlelight vigils were held on Saturday night. A poster at one read ""You rest in peace, we promise to take this struggle forward."" Here's what attendees had to say: Neelima Aryan, a graphic designer at the candlelight vigil at Jayanagar in South Bangalore, said: ""Our lives have been taken over by this incident. We've all been grieving. I have been bawling my guts out since I heard the news that the rape victim is gone from our midst."" ""There are so many people out on the streets today. Going by the sheer number of people coming together in different cities, even a cynic like me believes that there will be change."" ""This is the first time any incident of violence against a woman has become a nationwide issue."" V. Vandana, clinical psychologist,, who attended the candlelight vigil with her mother and sister: ""I feel anger against the government for not doing something. I am echoing the feelings of millions of women in India. I demand speedy justice in this case, in every such case in the future, and harsh punishment for those convicted."" ""I don't see big changes anytime soon. It will be a long-drawn fight and we need to bring about a change in behavior.""",2012,"India"
"154","At Delhi Protest Ground, Talk of Causes Behind Violence Against Women","Asia","The body of the 23-year-old victim of a fatal gang rape in New Delhi this month was returned to India from Singapore early Sunday, as calls for government action and protests in response to the attack continued to rouse people across India. Airport security sources say the plane arrived in the cargo area of New Delhi International Airport at 4:15 a.m. and that the body was whisked away through the old domestic terminal, known as the Palam side.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, president of the governing Congress party, received the body along with senior police officials amid growing public pressure on the government machinery. Later in the morning, her family held a private ceremony at a crematorium in southwest New Delhi, the local news media reported. In attendance at the ceremony, which was closed to the news media, were family, friends and a handful of politicians. Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi who was booed away by protesters at Jantar Mantar on Saturday, was spotted leaving the crematorium, a Reuters report said. There was heavy police deployment at the crematorium during the funeral. People trickled in and out of Jantar Mantar late into Saturday night - chanting, singing, mourning silently, praying and performing Hindu rituals around a fire. The crowds had visibly thinned since the morning, and groups sat in circles at the popular central Delhi protest spot. Even leaving aside the police officers and all-male riot squads, a large part of the gathering was men, young and old. The attack on the unidentified young woman, a medical student who died at a Singapore hospital on Saturday after being gang-raped Dec. 16 on a moving bus in Delhi, has led to calls for tougher laws and better policing to prevent violence against women in India. It is also prompting deeper discussions about the root causes of an apparent increase in this violence. One young man, who came to Jantar Mantar with his 54-year-old mother, said the problem in India is in the numbers. ""There are too many people in this country - 1.3 billion,"" said Shekhar Mahajan, 34. ""Life becomes a struggle and it's the survival of the fittest here. There is growing frustration and economic disparities."" Mr. Mahajan, a consultant based in Delhi, said that while female beauty is appreciated worldwide, lechery is explicit in India.  This, he said, is rooted in inequality and a lack of social awareness. Anjali Tripathi, 38, a homemaker, said that problems begin at home. ""From the very grass-root, the mothers have to educate their sons,"" she said. Mrs. Tripathi said she brought her teenage daughter to the protests, to try to ""educate her"" about rape. Many, like Mrs. Tripathi, came to Jantar Mantar with their families. Other women at the protest shared her view and emphasized the importance of strengthening value systems and ridding Indian households of gender biases. Men spoke instead of frustration and envy. ""This is a conservative society. There is sexual repression,"" Amit Bagani, 32, said as he observed a group of silent mourners, who refused to speak to anyone. A friend of Mr. Bagani's, Amul Vitthal, also 32, said, ""Our society is divided into a thousand classes, there are huge disparities - like mentality and access to money - between these classes, but all these layers intermingle with each other with very different mind-sets."" Both Mr. Bagani and Mr. Vitthal said that general lawlessness in the country, which allows people to commit crimes without fear of punishment, played a part. The peaceful protest also saw some explicit Indian themes. A large group huddled around a man performing a ritualistic hawan, or prayer fire, and loudly chanting mantras. As protesters brought pieces of broken plywood to fuel the fire, he urged everyone to chant the common Gayatri Mantra and join in. Rings of people shouted slogans like ""We Want Justice"" and ""Vande Mataram"" (Hail to the Motherland, a famous slogan from the freedom movement).  Some brought musical instruments, while others offered hot tea to the people who had decided to stay out on a winter night. ""We will suffer,"" said Mr. Bagani. ""This is our generation.""",2012,"India"
"155","Malaysia: Protections Sought for Migrant Workers","Asia","KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia must punish the recruitment agents accused of forcing more than 100 foreign women to work as domestic help without pay and enforce laws to protect migrant workers, the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur and a migrant workers' support group said on Monday. Malaysian immigration officers on Saturday rescued 105 women, mostly Indonesians, who said they had been forced to work as domestic helpers and at food stalls, been given little food and been confined to a four-story building at night in the port town of Klang, near Kuala Lumpur. ''A few of them said they had been beaten by the supervisors,'' said Chandran Muniandy, the assistant deputy director of immigration in Klang. ''They locked them up. They couldn't go anywhere.'' Some of the women in the group, which included 95 Indonesians, 6 Filipinos and 4 Cambodians, said that they had been forced to work for up to six months and had not been paid, Mr. Chandran added. Twelve people who worked for the agency, including Malaysians and foreigners, have been arrested under Malaysia's antitrafficking laws, Mr. Chandran said, adding that he expected to make more arrests. The case is the latest in a series of episodes involving Indonesian domestic workers that have at times strained diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Malaysia. Last month, two Indonesian domestic workers reported that they had been raped. One alleged that she had been raped by three police officers, while the other woman said her employer had raped her. In December 2011, Indonesia lifted a ban in place since 2009 that had prevented women from coming to Malaysia to work as domestic helpers. ''We will send a diplomatic note to the Malaysian government asking for tough punishment against them,'' said Suryana Sastradiredja, a spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy, referring to those alleged to be the perpetrators in the Klang case. Yusnida, an Indonesian woman, said that the agency had taken her and other women to work as maids in different homes each day from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m., according to a report in The Star, a Malaysian newspaper. ''My hands and legs were swollen from the long hours of work every day,'' she was quoted as saying. ''The agent only provided us with two meals a day. There was not enough food, and the workload was heavy.'' The agency told her that she could leave only once she had paid the agency a fee for bringing her to Malaysia, according to the report. Mr. Suryana, of the Indonesian Embassy, urged the Malaysian authorities to take swift action against those who committed crimes against domestic workers. He expressed anger that the three police officers charged with the rape of the Indonesian worker last month had been released on bail. ''I'm very, very angry with the situation,'' he said. ''If one Indonesian commits a crime, the Malaysian government is very quick to react, but a crime involving Malaysians, they are very slow.'' Irene Fernandez, the executive director of Tenaganita, an advocacy group for migrant workers in Kuala Lumpur, said the Malaysian authorities needed to provide better protection for domestic helpers and more effectively prosecute unscrupulous agents who abuse workers. ''A lot of homes are looking for part-time workers and cleaners, and so they are using that now and providing this form of labor where the workers are in a slavery-like situation,'' she said, adding that women were often lured to Malaysia by agents who promised them factory jobs, only to find themselves forced to work as domestic helpers after their arrival. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",2012,"Malaysia"
"156","Clashes Break Out in India at a Protest Over a Rape Case","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Thousands of protesters streamed into the heart of New Delhi on Saturday to demand justice and better policing in the wake of the brutal rape of a 23-year-old medical student. Protesters scuffled with the police throughout the day. Some police vehicles were damaged, and the police eventually used tear gas, water cannons and sticks to disperse the crowd. Officials said 35 protesters and 37 police officers had been injured, two officers seriously, and that six buses and several police vehicles were damaged. Outrage over the crime has continued to build across the country and the protesters in New Delhi promised to return in even greater numbers on Sunday, prompting Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde to hold a news conference on Saturday night to plead for calm. ''The government is committed to ensuring the safety of women in the capital as well as in the rest of the country,'' Mr. Shinde said. ''I appeal to this media, to all those who have come to support this dedication, to withdraw.'' Mr. Shinde listed four steps the government would take immediately to improve security in New Delhi: increase the number of buses at night, track those buses with GPS devices, ensure drivers carry identity badges and increase the number of police officers on busy routes. The police have arrested six suspects and Mr. Shinde said that the victim had given a statement to a magistrate on Friday night, and that the government had enough evidence to prosecute. The woman was raped on Dec. 16 after she boarded a private bus with her boyfriend. A group of men onboard the bus, normally used to ferry schoolchildren, beat the couple with iron rods and raped the woman. The men then dumped them by the roadside. The woman has had several rounds of surgery and a portion of her intestines had to be removed, doctors said. Mr. Shinde also said the government had canceled all permits for the transportation company that owns the bus on which the rape occurred. At the protest, people chanted ''We want justice!'' and held placards that said ''Save Women Save India.'' ''These rapists should be hanged publicly,'' said Shaelly Tomar, a student at Delhi University who took part in the protest with several friends. ''If that happens, nobody will dare to do it again.'' Tens of thousands of rapes are reported each year in India, while many more go unreported because rape victims are often shunned and unable to marry. Even so, reports of rape are on the rise, up about 25 percent in the past six years. Surveys have suggested that India is one of the most unsafe countries in the world for women. The roots of the problem run deep in a conservative society that is having trouble adjusting to educational and economic advances by women, long confined to the home. Demographics also play a role, with half of India's population under 25 and female infanticide and the neglect of girls creating a growing gender imbalance. But India's criminal justice system, riddled with incompetence, corruption and political meddling, seems unable to respond effectively.",2012,"India"
"157","Rape in the World's Largest Democracy","Asia","The brutal gang rape of a young woman in New Delhi this month has cast a cold light on how badly India treats its women. On Dec. 16, the 23-year-old physiotherapy student was viciously assaulted by a group of men while she was riding a bus with a male companion. The two had just seen a movie. Both she and the man were beaten with an iron rod and eventually stripped, robbed and dumped on the roadside. After three surgeries at an Indian hospital, the woman was flown to Singapore on Thursday for further treatment. She died early on Saturday after suffering what hospital officials said were ''signs of severe organ failure.'' This reprehensible crime reflects an alarming trend in India, which basks in its success as a growing business and technological mecca but tolerates shocking abuse of women. Rape cases have increased at an alarming rate, roughly 25 percent in six years. New Delhi recorded 572 rapes in 2011; that total is up 17 percent this year. And those are just the reported cases. Many victims, shamed into silence and callously disregarded by a male-dominated power structure, never go to the authorities to seek justice. Women are routinely blamed for inciting the violence against them. On Wednesday, an 18-year-old girl from Punjab who had been gang-raped in an earlier incident killed herself after police and village elders pressured her to drop the case and marry one of her attackers. India's news media now regularly carry horrific accounts of gang rapes, and this has begun to focus national attention on the problem. But the rape of the 23-year-old woman seemed to take the outrage to a new level, prompting tens of thousands to protest in New Delhi and elsewhere across the country. Still, political leaders were slow to react. It was days before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appeared on television to plead for calm and to promise to make India safer for women. Since the attack, six suspects have been arrested and the government has announced the formation of two commissions, one to identify police ''lapses'' and another to recommend ways to speed up sexual assault trials. Reforms are needed in the law enforcement system to make convictions more possible and punishments more convincing. And Indian leaders like Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress Party, must speak out more forcefully about bringing rapists to justice. More broadly, India must work on changing a culture in which women are routinely devalued. Many are betrothed against their will as child brides, and many suffer cruelly, including acid attacks and burning, at the hands of husbands and family members. India, a rising economic power and the world's largest democracy, can never reach its full potential if half its population lives in fear of unspeakable violence.",2012,"India"
"158","Victim Dies After Gang Rape That Galvanized India Over the Dangers That Women Face","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Government officials appealed for calm in the streets here Saturday after the death of young woman who was raped two weeks ago by a group of men who lured her onto a bus. The woman, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student whose rape on Dec. 16 had served as a reminder of the dangerous conditions women face in India, died ''peacefully,'' according to a statement by Dr. Kelvin Loh, the chief executive of Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. The woman, whose intestines were removed because of injuries caused by a metal rod used during the rape, has not been identified. She was flown to Singapore on Wednesday night after undergoing three abdominal operations at a local hospital. She had also suffered a major brain injury, cardiac arrest and infections of the lungs and abdomen. ''She was courageous in fighting for her life for so long against the odds, but the trauma to her body was too severe for her to overcome,'' Dr. Loh's statement said. After word of her death spread, protesters gathered in New Delhi at Jantar Mantar, a popular site for demonstrations. By noon, the crowd had swelled to several hundred, most of them young men. Upamanyu Raju, 21, a student at Delhi University, said he has been attending protests since a day after the rape victim was admitted to the hospital because of the ""utter atrocity of what happened."" Mr. Raju said he has given his younger sister pepper spray and a Swiss Army knife, but he worries that won't protect her. ""It's wrong to stop girls from going out"" of the house, he said, but there's little choice because the city is so unsafe for women. The roads leading to India Gate, the site of earlier protests that had turned violent, had been barricaded by the police, and nearby subway stations were closed. More than 40 police units have been deployed in the area, including 28 units of the Central Reserve Police Force, which are national anti-insurgency troops. The police have arrested six people in connection with the attack, Indian officials said. Revulsion and anger over the rape have galvanized India, where women regularly face sexual harassment and assault, and where neither the police nor the judicial system is seen as adequately protecting them. Top officials now say that further change is needed, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed his ''deepest condolences.'' ''We have already seen the emotions and energies this incident has generated,'' he said in a statement. ''It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channelize these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action.'' The government, he said, is examining ''the penal provisions that exist for such crimes and measures to enhance the safety and security of women.'' The six men arrested in the case will be charged with murder, the Delhi police said Saturday morning, as they, too, asked citizens to remain calm. ""We appeal to the people that they maintain peace,"" Satyendra Garg, a joint commissioner of the police, said in a televised interview. ""We want the situation in Delhi to normalize as soon as possible,"" he said. Until then, he added, Delhi commuters will have to plan their travel carefully and be aware of the restrictions. Activists and lawyers in India have long said that the police are insensitive when dealing with crimes against women, and that therefore many women do not report cases of sexual violence. India, which has more than 1.3 billion people, recorded 24,000 cases of rape last year, a figure that has increased by 25 percent in the past six years. On Thursday, Delhi government officials said they would register the names and photographs of convicted rapists on the Delhi police Web site, the beginning of a national registry for rapists. The family of an 18-year-old woman in the northern Indian state of Punjab who was raped last month by two men and committed suicide on Wednesday blamed the police on Friday for her death. Relatives of the woman say she killed herself because the police delayed registering the case or arresting the rapists. If the police ''had done their job, she would be alive today,'' the woman's sister, Charanjit Kaur, 28, said in a phone interview. ''They didn't listen to us; they didn't act.'' On Friday, the Punjab high court intervened, asking the police to explain their delay. Three police officers have been suspended in the case, according to news media reports. Punjab police officials did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. Ms. Kaur said the men abducted her sister from a place of worship near the small town of Badshahpur on Nov. 13, then drugged and raped her repeatedly. When her sister reported the attack at the local police station a few days later, she was asked to describe it in graphic detail and was ''humiliated,'' Ms. Kaur said. Over the next few days, she said, her mother and sister were repeatedly called to the police station and forced to sit all day. But the case was not registered for two weeks, as police officials and village elders tried to broker a deal between the men accused of the rape and the victim. In some parts of India, women are commonly married to men who have raped them. Ms. Kaur said the police told her family that, because they were poor, they would not be able to fight the matter in court. ''They kept putting pressure on my family to take money or marry the accused or just somehow settle the matter,'' she said. After no agreement was reached, the police registered the case, but made no arrests. The victim was stalked by the men accused of the rape, who threatened to kill her and her family if she refused to drop the complaint, her suicide note said. ''They have ruined my life,'' the note read, Ms. Kaur said. It named two men and a woman who allegedly helped them in the kidnapping. Those men have been arrested, the police said.",2012,"India"
"159","Shaky Response of India's Government in Fatal Rape Case Magnifies Outrage","Asia","NEW DELHI -- India often seems to careen from crisis to crisis, with protests regularly spilling onto the streets over the latest outrage or scandal, a nation seemingly always on the boil. But when things settle, as they inevitably do, little seems to change. Public anger usually cools to a simmer. Now, though, the heat has turned up again, as the death early on Saturday of a young woman savagely assaulted and raped here in the national capital has mushroomed into a new and volatile moment of crisis that has touched a deep chord of discontent. Protests that began more than a week ago as anguished cries against sexual violence in Indian society have broadened into angry condemnations of a government whose response has seemed tone deaf and, at times, incompetent. On Saturday, hours after the rape victim died at a hospital in Singapore, several thousand people gathered at Jantar Mantar, the designated protest spot in the center of the capital, to express their anguish and rage. The latest demonstrations followed a week that saw the authorities clash with protesters and cordon off the political center of the city with a huge display of force. ''What the government is doing is politically stupid,'' said Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, speaking during a protest last week. ''This will cause public disaffection, because people are seeing the government as inflexible and intolerant. If the government listened, they would find that people are trying to find solutions. ''The problem,'' she added, ''is the government is not even listening.'' For much of last week, as some protesters complained that the Indian state was more interested in protecting itself than its citizens, especially women, the symbolism has been stark: the authorities invoked emergency policing laws, closing off the governmental center of the capital, blockading roads and even shutting down subway stations -- a democratic government temporarily encircling itself with a moat. At one point, fire hoses were turned on college students. Those restrictions were eased by Dec. 25, even as New Delhi remained consumed by an anxious vigil as the young woman remained in critical condition. Doctors gave daily, televised updates on her condition until Wednesday evening, when the authorities unexpectedly flew her by special airplane to a hospital in Singapore, where her condition deteriorated before she died of organ failure. It is the graphic horror of the attack that set off the outrage: the victim was a 23-year-old woman, her identity still withheld, whose evening at the movies with a male friend on Dec. 16 turned nightmarish. The police say a group of drunken men waved the pair onto a private bus, promising a ride home, but instead assaulted them with an iron rod and raped the woman as the bus moved through the city. College students, mostly women, led the early protests. Sexual violence has become a national scandal in India, amid regular reports of gang rapes and other assaults against infants, teenagers and other women. But women also spoke of a more pervasive form of harassment: of being groped in public; of fearing to ride buses or subways alone; of victims, not attackers, being shamed and blamed. ''Rape happens everywhere,'' Urvashi Butalia, a feminist writer, wrote in The Hindu, a national English-language newspaper. ''It happens inside homes, in families, in neighborhoods, in police stations, in towns and cities, in villages, and its incidence increases, as is happening in India, as society goes through change, as women's roles begin to change, as economies slow down and the slice of the pie becomes smaller.'' Analysts say that India's coalition national government, led by the Indian National Congress Party, had an early opportunity to defuse the anger by embracing the protests and providing comfort and reassurance. Yet that moment, analysts agree, was missed, as top leaders misjudged how quickly public anger would escalate, especially among the young. It was a generational divide between young urbanites, often communicating by social media, and a government unable to find a way to win public trust. Reassurances offered by Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party, came off as unconvincing. Her son Rahul Gandhi, the party's heir apparent, has barely been visible. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh first attempted to calm the situation last Monday with a taped national address, but his speech was overshadowed by a stray remark. At the end of the taping, Mr. Singh, speaking in Hindi, asked ''Theek hai?'' meaning ''Is it all right?'' It was most likely an innocuous comment to the cameraman that ordinarily would have been edited out. But it quickly went viral and became a bitter rallying cry on social media. That was followed by a sexist comment about female protesters by a member of Parliament, who also happened to be the son of India's president. When the protests grew angrier and more violent, especially as men joined the ranks, many reportedly allied with rival political parties, the police responded with fire hoses, tear gas and nightsticks. Then the authorities invoked the emergency policing law, known as Section 144, to lock down the area around the presidential palace, Parliament and the main government offices. But if the government's heavy-handed response met with broad criticism, the hard line taken by some protesters also raised concerns. Frustrated, many protesters called for the death penalty against convicted rapists, alarming many people in a country where executions are extremely rare. Then a police constable died of a heart attack during the protests. The authorities say he had a seizure after being attacked by protesters -- a claim denied by some witnesses. ''Collectively, we seem to have unthinkingly bought into a narrative of empowered indignation in which 'anger' against 'authority' is deemed to be just and justifiable and any means to vent that 'anger' is rationalized as socially acceptable and politically correct,'' Harish Khare, a former spokesman for the prime minister, wrote in The Hindu. The constable's death seemed to shift the tenor of the public mood, and Mr. Singh made another speech calling for calm and promising action. ''The emergence of women in public spaces, which is an absolutely essential part of social emancipation, is accompanied by growing threats to their safety and security,'' he said. ''We must reflect on this problem, which occurs in all states and regions of our country, and which requires greater attention.'' On Saturday morning, many of the people gathered at Jantar Mantar, shouting ''We want justice,'' were determined that the protests should remain peaceful. Neha Sharma, 24, a student at Delhi University, said capital punishment was not the solution but that reforms were needed in the criminal justice system. ''We need to fix the system,'' she said. ''Neither the government nor the police are taking any steps.'' Protesters have repeatedly called for reforms, citing the frequent insensitivity of the police and the courts toward women and the skewed priorities of a government that devotes thousands of officers to protecting politicians and other so-called V.V.I.P.'s, even as departments too often fail to protect ordinary citizens. ''I'm now beginning to feel that my government is not capable of understanding the situation, let alone solving it,'' said Abhijit Sarkar, 28, a social activist who participated in a candlelight vigil last week. ''During the candlelight vigil, policemen were actually laughing at us.''",2012,"India"
"160","Six Accused in Rape Case in India Are Charged With Murder","Asia","NEW DELHI -- As protests grew in India on Saturday over the death of a young woman who was raped in New Delhi this month by several men in a moving bus, the police said six men accused of attacking her had been charged with murder. A police spokesman, Rajan Bhagat, said that if convicted of murder, the men could face the death penalty in the Dec. 16 attack, which shocked India because of its savagery, led to violent protests and prompted demands for improved protection for women as well as calls for the death penalty in rape cases. The country's Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that the death penalty should be used only in the ''rarest of rare'' cases, and fewer than 50 people have been executed since India's independence in 1947. The woman, who has not been identified, has become a symbol for the treatment of women in India, where rape is common and conviction rates for the crime are low. She boarded a bus with a male friend after watching a movie at a mall, and was raped and attacked with an iron rod by the men, who the police later said had been drinking and were on a ''joy ride.'' She died Saturday morning in Singapore, where she had been flown for treatment for the severe internal injuries caused by the assault. She had an infection in her lungs and abdomen, liver damage and a brain injury, the Singapore hospital said, and died from organ failure. Her body was flown back to India on Saturday. As news of her death spread Saturday, India's young, social-network-using population began to organize protests and candlelight vigils in places like the western city of Cochin in Kerala, the outsourcing hub of Bangalore and New Delhi, the capital. Just a tiny sliver of India's population can afford a computer or has access to the Internet, but the young, educated subset of this group has become increasingly galvanized over the New Delhi rape case. Late Saturday afternoon, thousands of people, most of them men, filled Jantar Mantar, an observatory and popular protest ground in New Delhi, where they waved placards and shouted slogans. When Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, arrived there in the early afternoon surrounded by a police escort, she was booed, heckled and jostled by the crowd. Ms. Dikshit, a diminutive 74-year-old, stayed only a few minutes, lighting a candle and holding her hands together in prayer. She did not speak to the crowd. As darkness fell here in New Delhi, the crowd at Jantar Mantar lighted hundreds of candles. Upamanyu Raju, 21, a student at Delhi University who attended the Jantar Mantar protest, said he had been protesting since a day after the rape victim was admitted to the hospital because of the ''utter atrocity of what happened.'' Mr. Raju said he had given his younger sister pepper spray and a Swiss Army knife, but he worried that those things would not protect her. ''It's wrong to stop girls from going out'' of the house, he said, but there is little choice because the city is so unsafe for women. According to a 2010 survey, more than a third of the women questioned in New Delhi said they had been physically sexually harassed in the previous year, but less than 1 percent reported the assault to the police. The roads leading to India Gate, the site of earlier protests that had turned violent, were barricaded by the police early Saturday, and nearby subway stations were closed. More than 40 police units were deployed in the area, including 28 units of the Central Reserve Police Force, which are national anti-insurgency troops. In South Delhi, hundreds of students from Jawaharlal Nehru University organized a silent march on Saturday from their campus to Munirka, the bus stop where the rape victim was picked up. The crowd of protesters trudged along a busy road, a few holding hastily made placards with phrases like ''You are an inspiration to us all.'' On Saturday morning, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed his ''deepest condolences'' to the family of the victim, who was a physiotherapy student. ''We have already seen the emotions and energies this incident has generated,'' he said in a statement. ''It would be a true homage to her memory if we are able to channelize these emotions and energies into a constructive course of action.'' The government, he said, is examining ''the penal provisions that exist for such crimes and measures to enhance the safety and security of women.'' And Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful female politician and the president of the governing Congress Party, made a rare televised statement that was broadcast Saturday. ''As a woman, and mother, I understand how protesters feel,'' she said. ''Today we pledge that the victim will get justice,'' she said. Even larger protests are planned for Sunday, protesters in Delhi said, including a so-called March for Freedom from the Delhi University subway station.",2012,"India"
"161","Six Charged With Murder in India as Rape Victim Dies","Asia","NEW DELHI -- The body of a young woman who was raped in New Delhi this month by several men in a moving bus was brought home Sunday, a day after the police said that six men accused of attacking her had been charged with murder. Airport security sources said the plane arrived from Singapore in the cargo area of Indira Gandhi International Airport at 4:15 a.m. Sunday and that the body was whisked away through the old domestic terminal. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, president of the governing Congress party, received the body along with senior police officials amid growing public pressure on the government machinery. The 23-year-old victim was cremated at a private ceremony in southwest New Delhi, the local news media reported. In attendance at the ceremony, which was closed to the news media, were family, friends and a handful of politicians. Sheila Dikshit, the chief minister of Delhi, who had been booed away by protesters at Jantar Mantar on Saturday, was spotted leaving the crematorium, a Reuters report said. There was heavy police deployment during the funeral. On Saturday a police spokesman, Rajan Bhagat, said that the six would be charged with murder.

"162","An 'Oppressive' Regime Limits Free Speech in India, Civil Liberties Expert Says","Asia","A Supreme Court lawyer, Karuna Nundy, spoke to India Ink to take stock of the recent arrest of two young women for their Facebook activity, the laws that were used to justify their arrest, and the way to resolve this case. Ms. Nundy, 36, has worked on a number of civil liberties cases and also advises governments of various countries on their compliance with local constitutions and international law. Here are highlights from the conversation: There are tight restrictions on speech and broad definitions in law: Ms. Nundy attributed India's colonial past to the country's inheritance of what she describes as ""oppressive laws."" She noted that in a democratic society, laws that are oppressive are torn out with time after the country's independence. But in India, ""what's actually happened is that the restrictions on speech have tightened,"" said Ms. Nundy. She cited examples like India's Information Technology Act of 2000, and the amendments in 2008 that restrict Web content that can be considered ""disparaging,"" ""harassing,"" ""blasphemous"" or ""hateful."" On Sunday, police arrested Shaheen Dhada, 21, who lives on the outskirts of Mumbai, after she posted a status update on Facebook questioning the citywide shutdown following the death of a powerful right-wing politician, Bal K. Thackeray. ""Respect is earned, given, and definitely not forced,"" Ms. Dhada wrote, according to the Indian media. ""Today, Mumbai shuts down due to fear, not due to respect."" A friend, Renu Srinivasan, 20, was also arrested for ""liking"" Ms. Dhada's post. ""The last time I checked, causing annoyance or inconvenience shouldn't throw you in jail for three years whether it's online or in real life,"" Ms. Nundy said. She said it was ""bizarre"" that the Indian law doesn't necessarily punish a person who says something inflammatory to a crowd of people, but ""if you say something online that annoys someone, then you can have criminal proceedings against you."" Ms. Nundy said the law that was cited in the women's arrest, Section 66A, is ""far too broad"" and needs to be harmonious with other laws in the Indian constitution. Section 66A of the Information Technology Act of 2008, among other things, criminalizes information sent digitally that is ""grossly offensive"" or has ""menacing character."" ""Section 66A is just wrong. It just has to go,"" Ms. Nundy said. The current administration has a poor report card on free speech: Ms. Nundy credited the governing United Progressive Alliance and the Indian National Congress party for passing an accountability law, the Right to Information Act, which is India's version of the Freedom of Information Act in the United states. But she argued that the application of Section 66A in recent years has considerably weakened India's reputation as a champion of free speech. ""It's been an incredibly oppressive regime in terms of crackdowns on free speech and protests,"" she said, citing the arrest of a cartoonist, Aseem Trivedi, in September over a satirical cartoon. The Maharashtra government charged Mr. Trivedi with sedition, disrespect of a national emblem and violation of the same information technology act. Though later, the sedition charge was dropped. She said the current climate involved ""blackmailing by fundamentalists"" and the government's ""appeasement"" of them by using what she described as ""draconian laws that stifle free speech and cut off one of the main arteries of a healthy democracy."" ""It's not just the laws that are problematic -- it's also the application of laws that operate in favor of the powerful,"" Ms. Nundy said. The chilling effect on social media is already apparent: ""Don't speak truth to power on Facebook or Twitter"" ""Now you have a young woman who, in pretty respectful terms, made a more honest critique than much of the national media. Yet, the force of the criminal law is brought to bear on her,"" Ms. Nundy said. ""The chilling effect on Facebook and Twitter is already apparent,"" she said, noting that people are using vague terms on the Internet to talk about Mr. Thackeray and his role in the communal riots in Mumbai in 1992-93. ""If you say something on Facebook or Twitter, you have to worry about goons on one hand and criminal laws on the other,"" Ms. Nundy said. Social media users who repeated Ms. Dhada's post in a show of solidarity are essentially ""sticking their necks out,"" Ms. Nundy said. ""They are overcoming fear to do this."" The lesson from all this? ""Don't speak truth to power on Facebook or Twitter,"" she said. The media in India are ""lionizing"" polarizing figures: Ms. Nundy was also critical of the mainstream media in India, which have been running reports about polarizing figures that bordered on adulation. ""There's a tendency to lionize people so easily,"" like the media did with Mr. Thackeray after his death, she said. ""His last few days have really exposed the entire circus for what it is."" A possible solution: Ms. Nundy said that the trial of the two women arrested for their Facebook activity is unlikely to drag on in court. ""These trials never go on to the end because you need state government sanction to prosecute,"" she said. Here is Ms. Nundy's solution: A formal apology from the police to the women, a refund of their bail and compensation for Ms. Dhada's uncle, whose hospital was attacked by members of Mr. Thackeray's party, Shiv Sena, which would be paid by the party and by the government as well, for failing to protect it. And she would also encourage users to continue to engage in debates on social media. ""Only then will a message go out that India's state and central government is democratic,"" Ms. Nundy said.",2012,"India"
"163","Police in Mumbai Facebook Arrests Suspended","Asia","Two police officers in the state of Maharashtra who recently arrested two young women over a Facebook post were suspended from duty on Tuesday, while the state changed the way it would enforce a controversial law. The moves were praised as a victory by free speech advocates, who have been sharply critical of the arrests and of India's loosely defined Internet law. Ravindra Sengaonkar, the police chief in the Thane district outside Mumbai, and Srikant Pingle, the officer in charge of the Palghar police station there, were suspended and a departmental inquiry initiated, the home minister of Maharashtra, R.R. Patil, announced in a news conference. The additional superintendent of police in the same district, Sangram Singh Nishandar, has also received a warning, Mr. Patil said. Last week, the police arrested Shaheen Dhada, 21, a medical student, after she posted an update on the social media site Facebook questioning the forced citywide shutdown after a far-right Hindu political leader died in Mumbai. A friend who clicked ""Like"" on the post, Renu Srinivasan, 20, was also arrested. The women were charged with engaging in speech that was offensive and hateful for a post that many experts say was neither. ""I don't have any enmity toward them,"" Ms. Srinivasan's father told the news channel NDTV on Tuesday, referring to the police. ""If there was no support from the media or the people in general from all over the country, I would have been in trouble."" Much of the criticism voiced online and by legal experts has focused on the Information Technology Act of 2008. The law was overhauled after the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai to grant the government broader powers to combat cybercrime, among other things. On Tuesday, Mr. Patil said that henceforth in cases involving violations of the I.T. Act, a senior officer would first investigate the matter and then a lawyer would be consulted before any action was taken. Both women were arrested and charged under section 505(2) of the Indian Penal Code, which relates to statements that are likely to create enmity, hatred or ill will between classes, and Section 66A of the I.T. Act. They were both released on bail, but the charges have yet to be dropped.",2012,"India"
"164","Five Ways Indian Internet Users Are Fighting for Free Speech","Asia","The two young women who were arrested for their Facebook activity last week have found an unlikely champion for their cause: another young woman, Shreya Singhal, who filed public interest litigation with the Supreme Court to challenge one of the controversial laws used to justify the arrests. That litigation was heard by the Supreme Court on Friday, which then ordered the central and some state governments to respond within six weeks. Ms. Singhal, who is a recent astrophysics graduate and plans to apply to law school, questioned the constitutionality of Section 66A. The dreary sounding, but much-talked about law criminalizes information sent online that can be considered ""offensive."" Although not many have petitioned the Supreme Court like the 21-year-old Ms. Singhal, thousands of social media users, civil society groups, lawyers and activists have protested Section 66A and the Internet laws in recent weeks. If readers believe the laws are muzzling online free speech, here are some ways experts offer to keep up the pressure to scrap the law:  Change.org, which Nicholas D. Kristof of The New York Times describes as ""the go-to site for Web uprisings,"" has a petition that requests the minister for information and communication technology to amend Section 66A and relook at the Internet laws. Gautam John, a trained lawyer who now strategizes for nonprofits, started the petition on Tuesday to offer citizens a space to register their protest. Although Mr. John acknowledged that the petition is unlikely to change the law, he still believes it's an important resource to document people's protest. ""One of the reasons why I support this petition in particular is because it offers very concrete suggestions, rather than just slamming the government,"" Nilanjana Roy, a literary critic, journalist and author, said via email. ""It points out a major area of concern: the government has a history of passing laws about the Internet in particular without involving stakeholders, or paying attention to the opinions and experiences of those who understand social media networks and online behavior patterns. Given the speed at which the Internet evolves and changes, this is a huge problem,"" she said. And maybe online petitions do work. Another campaign on Change.org demanded that the charges against the women booked for their Facebook activity be dropped. ""This move by the police is a gross clamp down on an individual's freedom of speech and expression,"" said Mukut Ray, 28, an activist from Kolkata who started the online petition, according to a statement. More than 21,000 supporters signed it. Although it's difficult to gauge the role the petition had to play, charges against the women have reportedly been dropped. Citizens can lobby their political leaders to take actions on issues they care about, analysts say. ""We don't contact our elected representatives enough,"" said Mr. John, who recommends interested people to go to the Web sites of Parliament's upper house, known as the Rajya Sabha, or the lower house, Lok Sabha, to find contact details for their representatives. ""Politicians should know it's not just a small bunch of people who are concerned,"" argued Mr. John. ""There are a large number and they have an opinion, too."" One lawyer who's familiar with the Internet laws controversy, said Kapil Sabil, the minister for communications and information technology, is the right man to lobby. This is the contact page for his ministry. People can file public interest litigation like Ms. Singhal did at the Supreme Court. Legal experts say that any citizen can write a letter to the High Court in their state or to the Supreme Court, which can then decide to file public interest litigation on behalf of the citizen. This retired physics professor had also filed litigation with the Madras High Court earlier this month asking the government to repeal section 66A, which he called ""arbitrary and unconstitutional."" The court responded to his request last week, serving notice to state officials, as well as the secretaries of India's home, law and information and broadcasting ministries, asking them to respond to the lawsuit in four weeks. ""I think at this point groups with expertise on the issue should file petitions in the Supreme Court, to be heard with the law student's petition,"" said Karuna Nundy, a lawyer and civil liberties expert, who filed a more comprehensive petition along with Ms. Singhal's on behalf of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, a prolific human rights group. Citizens can continue to engage on Facebook and Twitter about the controversial laws. Pranesh Prakash, policy director of the Centre for Internet and Society, notes that many traditional journalists are on social media sites and are bound to notice if users are protesting there. Indeed. Many media outlets drew attention to the outcry on Facebook and Twitter that followed the arrest of the women for their Facebook activity. Offline protests are scheduled by Free Software Movement of India, a coalition of groups that lobby for free software, free knowledge, and a free society. The coalition demands that the central government review the Information Technology Act. ""Free Software Movement of India condemns the misuse of 66A and calls for protests across the country from 1st December 2012 to 7th December 2012,"" the organization said on its Web site. ""As a minimum it should come out with clear rules under the Act clearly limiting the scope of Section 66A and others to be in conformity with the freedom of expression guaranteed under the Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.""

"165","A Conversation With: Suman Nalwa, head of Delhi Police's Unit for Women","Asia","Suman Nalwa, an additional deputy commissioner, is in charge of the Delhi police's special unit for women and children. Ms. Nalwa, 43, previously served on units focused on anticorruption and crimes against women. She holds a degree in international human rights law and has co-authored three books on domestic violence and cruelty towards women. For four years, Ms. Nalwa has worked on a police campaign to promote women's safety in Delhi.  Called Parivartan, or change, it was started in 2005 after several highly publicized rapes in the city.  Its goals include promoting discussion of sexual violence in slum areas and training junior officers and constables, who are usually the first responders, to deal with women's complaints appropriately. Such concerns have come to the fore again in Delhi in the wake of the attack Sunday. ""It is imperative that the police and other agencies concerned are sensitized to the danger that our daughters, sisters and mothers face every day,"" Sonia Gandhi, head of the Congress party, wrote in a letter Wednesday to Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Delhi's chief minister, Sheila Dixit. ""The security agencies must be motivated, trained and equipped to deal with the menace,"" she wrote. In a conversation with India Ink, Ms. Nalwa talked about how the police handle cases of sexual violence, about gender bias on the force and about the challenge of changing police officers' attitudes toward women.  She also defended the Delhi police in connection with declining conviction rates in rape cases. Can you tell us more about the Parivartan program, and how you are working to make the Delhi police more sensitive when they deal with women who have been the victims of sexual violence? The Delhi police have an ongoing program on gender sensitization. Our police training college is also doing a similar exercise. We have associated with a lot of nongovernmental organizations. They go to police stations and talk about these issues, rather than a police person talking to another police person. However, now I think we need more than gender sensitization. There is a need for the police just to be citizen-friendly so that people have faith in the organization, so that they can approach the police and know that action will be taken on their complaint and that they will not be harassed. Are discrimination and gender insensitivity major issues within the Delhi police force? I would not say there is discrimination, but yes, we do need gender sensitization. That's because most of my force, from wherever they are coming, are carrying their ideas of gender-specific roles. Based on their background, they have a certain idea of the role of women. For that to change, it's a tough process. You cannot do it at the snap of a finger. We have started it. But then, our police person goes back to the same society. Also,  most police officers are crime- and criminal-oriented. That's how they are. Any other way, they have to be taught, like how to talk to a woman, or how to have good communication skills. You have to look at the education level as well. A person who is recruited at the constable level is just 12 pass [a high school graduate]. He might be coming from a village on the outskirts of Delhi, or from outside Delhi. So he is carrying those values with him. He might have never seen a woman in a short skirt, so he might be quite disturbed by this. He might be ogling. So he has to be taught how to behave. It will take time for these mind-sets to change. One report found that many Delhi police officers believe that when a rape happens, it's often the woman's fault, that she ""asked for it."" How do you deal with this? At our level, we don't come to hear of this directly, but I do know it exists. People do try to justify that nothing would have happened in their area if the woman had dressed differently, or if she was not out late at night. I think if we have strong supervisory mechanisms, these things don't matter. I am not bothered about somebody's personal views in any situation as long as they are working well. At the end of the day, attitudes should not be hampering investigations. But surely they do hamper investigations? I don't think they do. In such cases, the supervisory mechanism is very strong. These are special-report cases, where officers have to inform their supervisors on a day-to-day basis of the progress they are making in the case. Whatever their beliefs might be, they have to investigate the case properly. We just need to have very strong standard operating procedures that say: this is what you are required to do. Period. I don't care what your biases might be, I don't care what you might be thinking, as long as the complaint is dealt with properly. Do you think putting in place supervisory mechanisms is more effective than gender sensitization at the core level? I would say that both have to run in parallel. Ultimately, you want the police to be sensitive. But we can't wait for years for them to be sensitive enough to start working. I don't want my investigations to suffer. I don't want complainants not to report just because they don't trust the force. So we need to have strong supervision, strong standard operating procedures. Along with that, we can have gender sensitization. But again, that is a five-year plan, or longer. Activists say one of the problems within the Indian police force is that there aren't enough women constables and investigating officers. Do you agree? Yes, that is a problem. Only 6 percent of the Delhi police force is female. The all-India figure is lower, between 3 and 4 percent. In Delhi, the numbers increased after the Commonwealth Games, because we had to recruit a lot of female officers for security duties like frisking and checking. But those recruitments were at the constable level. If you're talking about investigating officers, the percentage is still lower. Would having more female officers help the Delhi police deal with crimes against women? Yes, but I don't look at it that way. I will not be the one to segregate men and women. The fact is, you can never have a 100-percent-woman force. Why do I have to depend on the 10 or 20 percent that make up the woman force? One hundred percent of the force should be with me, working for me. Why should I ghettoize woman and children issues? I should get an effective response, irrespective of whether a police person is male or female. One of the main reasons that women don't register complaints after being assaulted or harassed is that they don't think their complaint will be taken seriously by a male police officer, or they fear that they may be mistreated or harassed. That image has to change. We have to make sure there are no black sheep in the force. We should not be shrinking from that responsibility. If a person can't be trusted, I don't want such a person in the police force. But I also want to tell women, ""Why don't you report?"" It's the underreporting which is a problem. If I know the extent of the problem, only then will I take corrective mechanisms. Right now, they say only 4 percent of women report cases of sexual harassment. With that data, can I go and say I need more women in the force? This is what I always say: If there is no electricity in my house I will be hounding the electricity department, ""I need light, I need light."" If the police are not there, and I'm paying for security as a taxpayer, why don't I shout and say that I need more security here? Conviction rates in cases of crimes against women are as low as 27 percent in India. Some say the police are not doing a good enough job of investigating and prosecuting crimes against women. I don't think there is any truth in this. I think it is very easy on the outside to say this is happening, but there has to be some detailed data. There have been prosecutions in all sensational cases and many have been successful. Low rates of convictions are not because of the lack of investigation. If a prosecution is unsuccessful, we take action against the investigating officer. We also read all the judgments that come to us. These judgments are very specific on why a person is acquitted, whether it's lack of evidence, whether it's a tardy investigation, whether the woman alleging rape has turned hostile. In Delhi, I can assure you that our investigation is above par. In heinous cases such as this gang rape, the senior-most officer is involved in the investigation. They know on a day-to-day basis what is happening. Imagine, in this case, the head of the force is involved. So there's a lot of seriousness. The next time anybody criticizes us, ask them on what basis they are saying things. Do they have any judgments that say the police didn't do its job? And how many of them? If there are about 500 cases, how many talk about police tardiness or lack of investigation? The number of reported rapes in Delhi is higher this year than before. If the police are doing their job, why is it that cases of sexual harassment and rape are increasing? It's not just this year, it's been happening for several years now, ever since economic liberalization. There is a lot of floating population in Delhi. We have a lot of people who are not residents of Delhi, but are just coming for work. Plus we have a lot of immigrants in Delhi, so social alienation is high. A lot of people have made it big, but they don't know their neighbors. So social corrective mechanisms are not in place. Earlier, people would hesitate to commit a crime because they were worried: What will people think of me? That doesn't exist anymore. Also, because of economic liberalization, many people in the national capital region have made good money through land deals. But they haven't changed their values. For years, they have treated women as second-class citizens or maybe worse than that. Delhi is different from Mumbai, which exists almost as an island. Delhi has such porous borders. It's very difficult for Delhi to control its floating popuQ: lation. Delhi is widely viewed as one of the most unsafe cities in India for women. How do you feel abouA: t that? I think part of it is that Delhi gets a lot of attention because it's the capital. The other thing is that people tend to compare crime rates now with rates in the past. Hasn't the situation in Delhi changed? Now, women are working late at nights. Did you have call centers 10 years ago? Now women go out in the night, to discotheques and other places. Did that happen before? Earlier, women didn't leave their homes, so there was no crime. We are doing our best, but of course, there is a lot more to be done.

"166","Protests Over Rape Turn Violent in Delhi","Asia","NEW DELHI- Protests over a recent gang rape quickly gained force over the weekend, tapping into longstanding fury against entrenched corruption and lopsided justice, and leading to clashes with the police. Seven days of demonstrations peaked Sunday, as thousands of people joined women's and students' groups despite a hastily enacted ban on protesting in New Delhi. The crowds taunted the police and attacked the car of a member of Parliament. The police, in turn, fired tear gas and water cannons, beat protesters with bamboo sticks and arrested dozens. ""Many students who were protesting peacefully were attacked,"" said Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, who had joined the protest with her daughter. ""These are patriotic and respectable citizens. You cannot respond to them in this ham-handed manner."" Kulsoom Rashid, 27, rubbed her eyes and said she had been tear-gassed. ""This is how they are responding,"" she said, seething. ""Hundreds of rapists are running scot-free, and the entire Delhi police is standing here to stop people like me?"" By late afternoon Sunday, political parties had joined the crowd, increasing the number of confrontations with the authorities. Protesters overturned a car, and clashes became fierce. After several recent, highly publicized rape cases, India has been struggling to come to grips with the scale of the vastly underreported problem. Even when rapes are reported, suspects are rarely found and arrested. In the most recent case, a 23-year-old medical student who boarded what she thought was a public bus on Dec. 16 was brutally raped and beaten nearly to death by a group of men. Six suspects are in jail. The rapid reaction has done little to stem public anger. On Sunday, protesters jostled with the police, calling them ""cowardly,"" ""corrupt"" and ""inept,"" as they tried to push through the cordon. ""Why don't you come and join us?"" one agitated protester asked a senior police officer. ""Aren't you angry at what happened?"" The crowd swarmed over the India Gate monument in the city center and were prevented from marching on the Rashtrapati Bhavan, or presidential palace, only by the intervention of hundreds of police officers, many of them from the country's elite Rapid Action Force. ""These people have lost patience with a government that has no sense of justice, no sense of accountability and is totally corrupt at the top,"" said Prem Shankar Jha, a former editor of the Hindustan Times. Corruption has become a dominant political theme in India in the past several years, starting with the Anna Hazare movement of 2011 and continuing this year with the creation of a political party by one of Mr. Hazare's former disciples, Arvind Kejriwal. The protests on Sunday recalled demonstrations in 2011, with the focus shifted from government corruption to the difference in security between the elite and the rest of India. ""These people see that the cops are only protecting the ministers and the top bureaucrats, while the average person on the street, she feels very vulnerable,"" said Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, a political analyst and commentator. Some experts say that the gap is undermining claims of legitimacy by the authorities. ""The consistent thing we have been seeing for the last couple of years is that people have come to believe that the state has become an instrument largely for the benefit and protection of a few - and mostly politicians,"" said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ""That momentum is producing an open contempt of the state."" Just to reach the protest sites, the crowds defied multiple government efforts to keep them away. Officials had shut down many central subway stations, curtailed bus service, diverted traffic and even invoked a law making it illegal for more than a few people to gather. Dozens who had camped overnight at protests sites were arrested and dragged away. Top government officials pleaded on national TV Saturday night for people to stay away. The protest organizers demanded that the courts speed the progress of about 100,000 rape cases; that the police to pledge to register rape complaints promptly; that Parliament hold a special session to strengthen laws on rape, sexual harassment and child abuse; and that the Delhi police commissioner be fired for his handling of the protests. The demands offer a hint of the deep distrust with which most Indians regard the police. ""If there is one state institution that people fear and distrust the most, it's the police,"" Mr. Mehta said. ""A lot of people, particularly women, find police more fearsome than the guys out there on the street."" There are more than 80,000 human rights complaints filed in India against police officers every year, according to Mr. Jha, the former Hindustan Times editor. That represents a small fraction of the actual number of crimes committed by officers, he said, most of which are sexual assaults against women.

"167","After Protests, Lockdown in New Delhi","Asia","The New Delhi authorities shut down the heart of the capital for a second day, snarling traffic and disrupting the commute of thousands of workers a day before the Christmas holiday. Monday's lockdown followed weekend clashes between the police and thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets to urge administrators to make the city safer for women, after the brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old medical student earlier this month shocked the nation. Six of the suspects have been arrested. The police said they sealed off major arteries of the city, including several metro stations, to prevent crowds from engaging in violent protests, citing a law called Section 144, which bars people from gathering. Knots of police officers could be seen lurking on street corners on Monday, and parts of the city remained deserted. ""144 has been imposed to prevent violence and the destruction of property,"" said Rajan Bhagat, a public relations officer for the Delhi Police. He said the police don't have any immediate plans to lift the ban, which has been in place since Sunday morning. Mr. Bhagat said that since the weekend the police have been unsuccessfully trying to divert demonstrators to Ramlila Maidan, an enormous field that is often used for protests. Critics of the government said the lockdown of the city's political center was an attempt by the governing Indian National Congress party to avoid protesters' fury. On Sunday, thousands of Delhi residents joined students and women's groups, but the rally also drew members of the political parties that oppose Congress. India has been struggling to deal with its abysmal safety record for women. One survey says India is one of the most dangerous places to be a woman. ""There is genuine and justified anger and anguish at the ghastly crime of gang rape committed last Sunday in Delhi,"" said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in an address to the nation Monday morning. ""As a father of three daughters myself, I feel as strongly about this as each one of you.""",2012,"India"

Anger at this crime is justified but violence will serve no purpose. I appeal to all concerned citizens to maintain peace and calm. I assure you that we will make all possible efforts to ensure security and safety of women in this country. The Home Minister has already spoken about the steps being taken. We will examine without delay not only the responses to this terrible crime but also all aspects concerning the safety of women and children and punishment to those who commit these monstrous crimes.

"169","Subway Closings and Detentions Frustrate Protesters and New Year's Revelers in Delhi","Asia","For New Year's Eve, a night that some call ""the least safe"" in Delhi, the Metro Rail Corporation management said it had shut three stations in central Delhi. In a city where the subway is seen as one of the few forms of safe public transport, particularly for women, the decision to stop people from using the centrally located Rajiv Chowk, Barakhamba and Patel Chowk stations has residents fuming, with many seeing it as the latest attempt by the government to keep protesters from assembling in central Delhi after a victim of a gang rape died over the weekend. Only the Metro is affected. There are no road diversions on Monday, nor any traffic restrictions, said Rajan Bhagat, the public relations officer of the Delhi police.  He said that protesters had been trying to go to ""prohibited areas"" on Sunday, which prompted the police to block roads in central Delhi, but that on Monday the protesters were staying out of those areas, so there was no need to close any roads. Mr.  Bhagat said that the police were allowing peaceful protests at Jantar Mantar and Ramlila Maidan. But when asked why the police shut the Metro stations and bus routes on Saturday when demonstrators tried to protest peacefully at Jantar Mantar, he declined to comment, saying that he was too busy to answer such questions. Upamanyu Raju, 21, a student from Delhi University who has helped organize protests over the last couple of weeks, said that a gathering of a few hundred people at the central park at Connaught Place at 2 p.m. on Monday was told to disperse by the police. The protesters then moved to Jantar Mantar via Janpath Road. ""We didn't want to have a confrontation with the police at this moment so we came to Jantar Mantar,"" Mr. Raju said. The authorities' attempts to block off the political center of the city have provoked public ire. Meanwhile, one prominent protester has accused the government of harassment. ""I was detained by the Delhi police after we submitted a memorandum to the Home Minister with five-step action plan to deal with sexual violence against women and declared a protest,"" said Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, 27, president of Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena, a right-wing organization. Mr. Bagga and his organization began protesting at India Gate on Dec. 22. The day after, the local area police showed up at his home, he said.  Because he wasn't there, they detained his father for six hours and took him to India Gate to point out his son. But the police were not able to find the younger Mr. Bagga. On Dec. 24, the police showed up again at his home.  This time, they took the younger Mr. Bagga to the police station.  He was ordered to stay there all day and report to the station every day until further notice, he said. ""They told me if I promised to stay at home and not protest, they would let me go,"" Mr. Bagga said.  Subsequently, the police told him he could stop reporting to the station on Dec. 26. Mr. Bagga's organization then called for a ""Hang the Rapists"" march for Saturday, spreading the word through Facebook, Twitter and e-mail and by putting up posters, he said.  However, Mr. Bagga could not attend - he had been detained the previous day at 6:30 p.m., this time under the orders of the assistant commissioner of police of the Chanakyapuri area. ""They gave me no papers, didn't charge me with anything,"" he said.  ""There's a law - when they detain, they have to produce me in front of the magistrate within 24 hours, but they didn't."" Thirty hours after his arrest, he was allowed to leave but now has one or two police officers standing outside his house, he said. ""We detained him as a precaution so that he wouldn't cause chaos,"" said Surinder Sandhu, the local police officer who initially detained Mr. Bagga.  ""We saw the posters and local information told us."" Bhagat Singh Kranti Sena's call for action  ""was a bit destructive,"" the police officer said. ""We made an entry in our register, and we didn't have to give him any papers,"" Mr. Sandhu said.  ""Under Delhi Police Act Section 65, if you think they will cause disturbance, then we can detain them for a few hours."" Even though he was being watched by the police, Mr. Bagga pledged to keep fighting the government. ""I believe they are getting orders from the government and they think the protests will stop by doing all this,"" Mr. Bagga said. ""How can they government just stop us? It's our constitutional right.""",2012,"India"
"170","Chinese Activists Demand Clarity on Domestic Violence Law","Asia","BEIJING - Li Yan, a woman from Sichuan Province who was convicted of killing her abusive husband, faces execution. As activists in China fight to save her life, three women last week delivered a petition with more than 12,000 signatures to the National People's Congress in Beijing, demanding transparency in the drafting of a planned national law against domestic violence. Fed up with being excluded from the decision-making process, Chinese feminists not only want a law against domestic violence, they also want to know exactly what's going into it, in a new push for accountability from their opaque government. The petition, ""Asking for Openness and Transparency in the Process of the Anti-Domestic Violence Law,"" spells that out. Bai Fei, a university student from Shanghai, is one of three women behind the petition. Signatures were gathered online, the Yunnan Information News reported. Ms. Bai grew up in a family where her father beat her mother. She wanted to know if the new law would help people like her mother, the newspaper wrote. ""When the law comes out, will my mother be able to get legal protection?"" asked Ms. Bai. ""What level of protection will the law afford her? If I can't know what's going into it, I won't feel at all safe."" ""What if the law doesn't consider her injuries severe enough?'' she asked. ""After they divorced, my father continued to use violence against her, but not heavy violence. Would my mother still be protected by the law?"" Since 2000, 28 cities, regions and provinces in China have drawn up rules or policies against domestic violence, but there is no national law. The All-China Women's Federation and other organizations, including grass-roots groups, have for years lobbied the central government to enact a law. Last year the congress agreed to include such a measure in its future legislative schedule. It is not clear when a law might be adopted, but that is most likely to be some years away.",2013,"China"
"171","In China's Most-Watched Divorce Case, 3 Victories, 1 Defeat","Asia","BEIJING - For over a year, Chinese society has been riveted by the case of Kim Lee, an American woman who did something extremely unusual: go public with accusations of domestic violence against her wealthy and famous husband, Li Yang. On Sunday, in a major victory for feminists and the rule of law, a Beijing court granted Ms. Lee a divorce on grounds of abuse and made history by issuing a three-month protection order against her ex-husband - a first in the nation's capital, Beijing, according to lawyers and the Chinese media. ""It's a very important case. All of society was paying attention,"" Guo Jianmei, a leading rights lawyer, said in a phone interview. ""We've been waiting for this for a long time."" The high-profile case was played out on microblogs and through the media. A multimillionaire, Mr. Li argued on television that domestic violence was acceptable in China, angering ordinary people. The father of the couple's three daughters, he is the founder of ""Crazy English,"" a way of learning the language that involves shouting loudly to overcome inhibitions. Ms. Lee, a former public school teacher in the United States, worked closely with Mr. Li in his business. She said he threatened her, and failed to appear in court for the verdict. Ms. Guo listed what she said were the case's three victories - and one defeat. ""Firstly, the court granted a protection order. Secondly, it acknowledged domestic violence as the grounds of divorce,"" something still too rare, she said. ""Thirdly, it ordered Li Yang to pay 50,000 renminbi in compensation for the violence, which although it's a small amount is important in saying 'it's not acceptable,'"" she said. Yet Ms. Guo said that the financial terms of the settlement - Ms. Lee will receive 12 million renminbi ($1.9 million) and a fixed sum annually until her daughters reach 18 - showed that Chinese courts failed to uncover Mr. Li's true assets and make him pay commensurately. ""He hid almost all his money from the court,"" said Ms. Guo. ""And the court didn't force him to reveal it. So in reality the settlement was very unjust."" At the bottom lies the failure of the state to protect the weaker and poorer against the stronger and richer, she said. ""It's a huge flaw in the system,"" she said. ""The state doesn't intervene to force rich men like Mr. Li to reveal their true assets, and it doesn't allow lawyers like us to do it either, it doesn't give us the rights. This is a society that doesn't control those with money or power. It doesn't see things through to the end."" But Ms. Lee is relieved. In an interview, she explained what drove her through painful days and months, as she documented the abuse and threats with reluctant police officers, when some men on the streets cursed her (though many people encouraged her), when the court seemed to delay, and people in positions of authority told her to give up, as many Chinese women do. ""In the beginning, I did it for my daughters. I wanted to show them I was strong,"" the 41-year-old woman said. But after her situation became public in 2011, the letters and emails started arriving, from abused women and their children, describing their fear and suffering. By last Friday, two days before the divorce, she had received 1,141 such messages from strangers, she said. ""It quickly became a matter of the other women and their stories,"" she said. ""No one else was speaking out. I just felt I had to."" ""I hope people will use me as an example of success,"" she said. ""Now I can say, 'use your rights, these are the laws and it's painful and they could be better but you can succeed."" The difficulty in getting help continues to drive many abused women to desperate measures, she said. ""You can pick up the law or you can pick up a fruit knife. But it's still easier for people to pick up a knife than the law, and that's what's happening,"" she said, pointing to the case of Li Yan, a woman in Sichuan province sentenced to death for murdering her abusive husband in 2010, a sentence feminists are frantically fighting to stop. ""She's an example of someone who tried to pick up the law and she failed,"" said Ms. Lee. ""When I went to the police once they said, 'this isn't America,'"" she said. ""But I didn't use anything but Chinese law. I stayed on this long road. That's why I think it's really hopeful.""",2013,"China"
"172","Where is India's Feminist Movement Headed?","Asia","On the night of June 28, 2012, the sarpanch, or the elected head of the village council, of Singar village in rural Haryana, his nephew and two other men allegedly abducted a 15-year-old girl. According to the official complaint, The Hindu reported, the four men beat her up and then took turns repeatedly raping her. Two days later, they dropped off the young woman, battered and violated, outside her village, about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from New Delhi. Though more than eight months have passed since the rape, the victim has yet to see justice. The young woman is not alone in being physically and sexually abused and then forsaken by the law in India; there are thousands of other women whose cases languish in the Indian courts of law for years, if not decades. By contrast, when a young woman was gang raped on a moving bus in New Delhi on Dec. 16, India reeled in horror and masses of protesters took to the streets. It might have been because she embodied in so many ways the aspirations of the new India, or because of the gruesome nature of the act, or because it happened in an urban metropolis, not in the remote hinterland, or because it was simply one assault too many. The public outrage pressured the authorities to quickly arrest five men and one teenager, who are now on trial in a fast-track court. The New Delhi gang rape has become a landmark in the fight for women's rights and feminism in India, leading to legislative changes and moving gender to the center stage of political debates. Though the Indian women's movement has achieved much, activists and scholars say that there is still a long way to go. Meanwhile, the women's movement is grappling with ever-new problems as vast economic and social changes sweep the country while old mindsets steeped in patriarchy still prevail. Women's rights advocates are hopeful that the renewed spotlight on women's issues will lead to a sustained campaign. Annie Raja, general secretary of the National Federation of Indian Women, said that the growing realization that a woman's constitutional right to lead a life of dignity is in question will lead to more mobilization in the future. ""This incident has made the younger generation come out on the streets to demand their constitutional rights,"" she said. ""Whether until yesterday they were upper middle-class citizens not willing to come out on the streets, today they are raising their voices and the government will have to take note of these changes."" For now, it appears that the government has taken notice. In the days following the New Delhi gang rape, a fast-track court was created to try the accused, and a panel was set up to analyze India's rape laws and submitted its recommendations, some of which made their way into an ordinance signed by the president. Also, when the central government's budget was announced last month, much emphasis was given to women's security and empowerment. While all of these measures have been found wanting by women's rights advocates, they are generally seen as a step in the right direction. Seasoned activists are quick to point out that the changes that have taken place since the New Delhi gang rape are a culmination of many years of work. ""The widespread response to the rape shows that there has been a growing thinking and feeling that has been happening for decades,"" said Paromita Vohra, a filmmaker, writer and curator whose work has focuses on gender, politics and popular culture. India has had a vibrant women's movement that harks back to the pre-independence movement with protests for social reform in the nineteenth century. The movement has been marked by tragedies that have led to campaigns resulting in new laws: the Mathura rape case of 1972, the protests against the dowry-related death of Tarvinder Kaur, who was burned to death in her marital home in 1979, the protests sparked by the act of sati (where a widow is cremated on her husband's funeral pyre) by Roop Kanwar in 1987 and the protests against the Bhanwari Devi gang rape in 1992. The challenges that the feminist movement now faces stem from the vast diversities within India. Feminism within India is divided along class, caste, sexuality and disability, and as parts of India develop at a faster rate, increased social and economic inequality is giving rise to new problems like sexual harassment at the workplace and in public transport. ""While changes are taking place in economic parameters, social parameters are not keeping pace with these transformations,"" said Indu Agnihotri, director for the Center for Women's Development Studies. ""The lack of progressive values unleashes a strange volatility in the social system, and this affects the women who are the most vulnerable section of the population."" Because of the rapidly changing socioeconomic context across the country and the vital issues at hand, Indian feminism is often seen as infused with a sense of urgency. ""Feminists in India are fighting for issues of immediate critical urgency - violence, equal wages, life with dignity,"" said Annie Zaidi the co-author of ""The Bad Boy's Guide to the Good Indian Girl"" and the author of ""Known Turf: Bantering with Bandits and Other True Tales."" ""If the stakes are much higher - if the question is whether I can go to work or not - then the sense of immediacy is much higher."" As it deals with the new problems, Indian feminism is still battling with many of the old problems. The most recent government ordinance introduced some positive measures, like making stalking, voyeurism and acid attacks punishable under criminal law, but it failed to account for marital rape and acts of rape by armed forces personnel. And though the New Delhi gang rape has brought renewed attention to sex crimes, prosecutions of those cases still move at a glacier pace. On Monday, India's law minister, Ashwani Kumar, said there are currently 24,000 cases related to rape and sexual harassment pending in India's Supreme Court and various high courts. ""In a sense, the demands of Indian feminism haven't changed radically - and this is because there hasn't been any marked change in the law,"" said Nivedita Menon, author of ""Seeing Like a Feminist."" ""Our demands of the state haven't changed. We are still asking for accountability of the police, state agencies and the law and protocols to be set in place to deal with sexual violence."" However, over the years, women's rights activists have become savvier about how to marshal their forces. Flavia Agnes, a women's rights lawyer who has worked on gender issues and legal reform since the Mathura rape case, said that a better knowledge of the system has helped in the struggle. ""While the base issues are the same, how we are dealing with them is different,"" said Ms. Agnes. ""The demands of feminists or the women's movement are getting more sophisticated, more detailed on what needs to be changed exactly."" She added that she was now looking at procedural matters and demanding that institutions be made more accountable so that legal reform has an actual effect on the ground. But one of the most difficult tasks for feminists can't be accomplished in a courtroom or in a mass protest: that is, changing men's underlying attitudes toward women, which many advocates say is necessary for a permanent end to the violence, abuse and persecution that women in India experience. ""Nonce jingoism and sloganeering are seductive but frothy,"" said Vrinda Nabar, a former chairwoman of English at Mumbai University and author of ""Caste as Woman."" ""Mindsets need to change at every level, and all of us need to recognize the inherited prejudices of our collective consciousness once the protesters and their placards have vacated the streets.""",2013,"India"
"173","What India's New 'Anti-Rape' Bill Actually Says","Asia","NEW DELHI-After clearing the Lok Sabha or lower house of Parliament earlier this week, a bill to toughen India's laws on sexual offenses is being debated in the upper house on Thursday. The bill, which will amend India's penal code and laws of criminal procedure and evidence, was drafted in response to widespread street protests after the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi in December. Among the significant provisions of the bill, seen by India Ink, are longer sentences for sex offenders, a broader definition of rape and punishments for other sex crimes like stalking and voyeurism. Here are some of the bill's crucial changes: - Women's rights advocates and victims of sexual offenses have long accused a male-dominated police force of refusing to register complaints by women, and even facilitating a monetary settlement or brokering a marriage between victims of rape and the accused. The bill lays down punishment for police officers who fail to record the initial complaint, known as the first information report, of a woman who alleges she was attacked with acid, assaulted by a man who intended to molest her or ""outrage her modesty,"" stripped naked or raped. Such officers can receive jail terms of six months to two years. - The bill creates a separate offense to address acid attacks, common in South Asian countries, especially by men who are spurned by women they express an interest in. Under the bill, those convicted of throwing acid on a woman, causing ""permanent or partial damage or deformity,"" or maiming or disfiguring her, will be punished with prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life and a fine. With an eye to the rehabilitation of the victim, the bill says the fine should be paid to the woman as compensation. - The bill defines sexual harassment, which includes ""physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures,"" a demand for sexual favors and showing pornography to a woman who does not want to see it. Those convicted of harassment can receive prison sentences of up to three years. Making ""sexually colored"" remarks is also included in the definition of sexual harassment, for which the bill prescribes a prison sentence of up to a year. - The bill criminalizes the forced stripping of women, or disrobing, in public spaces or in private confines, with a minimum jail term of three years and a maximum of seven. Under the current law, disrobing a woman is not a separate offense. - One of the more controversial provisions in the bill is the section on voyeurism, which seeks to punish men who watch or photograph women who are conducting a ""private act,"" such as bathing, using the toilet or having sex. The bill lays down a punishment of three to seven years in prison for those convicted of voyeurism more than once. Voyeurism is not a separate offense under the current law. - The bill creates another new, and much-debated, offense: stalking. This provision deals with men who follow a woman and establish contact with her or attempt to do so ""to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest"" by the woman. E-stalking, or monitoring of a woman's activities online, such as browsing or checking of e-mail, has also been made punishable. A man convicted of stalking once can be sentenced to a term of up to three years, and if convicted again can receive a sentence of up to five years. - The bill expands the definition of rape to include not just penovaginal intercourse but the insertion of an object or any other body part into a woman's vagina, urethra or anus, and oral sex. This responds to a longstanding demand of women's rights groups. The issue of rape by different means was highlighted in the Delhi gang-rape case, where an iron rod was inserted into the young woman's body. Prison sentences for rape can range from seven years to life. The current law allows courts to hand down a sentence of less than seven years for ""adequate and special reasons,"" a provision omitted in the bill. - The bill raises the age of consent for sex to 18. This means that intercourse with a woman under 18 is statutory rape and courts conducting rape trials cannot consider whether the woman consented to having sex. It also, in effect, criminalizes consensual sex with women under 18, a subject of much controversy. - The bill does not make marital rape an offense, ignoring a longstanding demand of women's rights advocates. - The bill takes a tough stand on rape by public servants. Under the current law, when a rape is committed by a police officer or prison staff, those convicted can be punished with sentences ranging from 10 years to life. The bill clarifies that imprisonment for life means the convict must remain in prison till the end of his natural life. The bill also allows women to bring a complaint of rape against members of the armed forces. - When a rape leaves a woman dead or in a ""persistent vegetative state,"" the bill demands a minimum sentence of 20 years in prison and a maximum punishment of death. This is the first time that the death penalty is being prescribed for sexual offenses in India, which, unlike nearly all European nations, retains the death sentence, but uses it only in the ""rarest of rare cases."" - The bill increases the minimum punishment for gang rape from 10 years imprisonment to 20 years, and the maximum punishment to life imprisonment. - The bill provides for life imprisonment or death for repeat offenders convicted of rape and gang rape. - The bill makes procedural changes to address concerns that women are uncomfortable or intimidated by male police officers, or are treated with insensitivity when they approach police stations to register complaints of sex crimes. The bill requires that all initial reports involving sexual harassment, disrobing, voyeurism, stalking, rape and gang rape be taken by women officers only. - In order to ensure speedy trial, the bill requires that rape trials be completed ""as far as possible"" within two months from the time the police file charges against the accused.",2013,"India"
"174","Hey, What About Men's Rights?","Asia","NEW DELHI - In India, women's rights have received a lot of attention recently. Too much attention, according to one small but passionate organization, India's Men's Rights Association. The group was started in Pune in 2010 to ""specifically target the issues men are facing in everyday life, and how they are being discriminated against by society and the law,"" said the group's founder, Atit Rajpara, 34, in a telephone interview. ""Whenever any lawmaking is happening, no one thinks about the men."" The group's stated goals include: breaking the ""false myth"" of the male-dominated society, rebelling ""against social mindset assumption of men being born criminals"" and creating a ""Men's Welfare Ministry."" Mr. Rajpara said his group tried valiantly to have their point of view heard by the Verma Committee, which was set up after the Dec. 16 gang rape in Delhi to review how India protects women. The committee and other activists ignored 5,000 e-mails sent by Men's Rights Association members on the issue, he said. ""We are not against women,"" Mr. Rajpara said, but he contended that women are abusing laws that are already on the books to torment their husbands and other men. Mr. Rajpara was married in 2004 but had an acrimonious divorce. At one point, his ex-wife sued him for child support, he said, even though they had no children. It took him a year and a half to clear his name and get the child support demand dropped, he said. The new ""antirape"" law, which passed both houses of India's Parliament this week, ignores 50 percent of India's population, he said, and could be used to falsely target men. Members and fans of the group were heatedly discussing the new law on the Men's Rights Association Facebook page on Friday. ""Here comes the first misuse,"" the group titled a Facebook post of an article from The Times of India about a man who could be the first in India to be booked for the crime of stalking, now a criminal offense. The paper reported that 20-year-old engineering student filed stalking charges against a man who kept sending her explicit text messages, even though she told him she was not interested in a relationship. ""Only becuz of those bastards protesting at India gate all men will suffer,"" one fan of the men's rights group commented on the article. The site is heavy with pictures decrying the treatment of men (""Men, this is how the world sees you,"" reads one photo of a roll of toilet paper) and petitions like this one, which declares, ""Rape is a shield for a woman to harass men sexually and get away with it."" Writing about the new antirape law, another Facebook commentator introduced a possible future strategy for the group's members: ""Now it's better to avoid women, like u avoid cobras...""",2013,"India"
"175","'If the Police Had Done Something, She Would Be Alive Today'","Asia","BADSHAHPUR, Punjab The family of Paramjeet Kaur sat huddled in the dusty courtyard outside their house on Monday afternoon as a stream of senior police officers, politicians and villagers arrived to pay their condolences after Ms. Kaur killed herself on Dec. 26, nearly six weeks after she was raped by two men. The family kept asking: Where were all these people when their 18-year-old daughter had sought justice from the village council of Badshahpur and the police, only to be humiliated and pressured to strike a deal with her rapists? ""They are all here now, but nobody helped us then,"" said Charanjit Kaur, 28, Ms. Kaur's sister, as she sat against the whitewashed wall, her knees drawn up to her chin. ""If the police had done something, she would be alive today."" As national anger rises over the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi, the Punjab police are being criticized for driving Ms. Kaur, who once dreamed of being a police officer herself, to drink poison and kill herself. Activists have long complained that India's largely male police force is not sensitive in handling sex crimes and fails to investigate them rigorously. Ms. Kaur's suicide ""reinforces everything we have been saying,"" said Kalpana Viswanath, a women's rights activist based in Delhi. ""There is no seriousness by the police when it comes to crimes against women."" The victim in Punjab was drugged and raped repeatedly on Nov. 13 and left unconscious near a gurudwara, a Sikh place of worship, according to a report filed with the police. She reported the rape five days later, but her complaint was not registered until Nov. 27. After that, family members said they and the victim were called to the station day after day, and made to sit from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Ms. Kaur accused two men of raping her and named a third man who she said gave the keys to his shed where the rape took place. The accused lived in neighboring villages. One worked for a middleman involved in the trade of farm produce and the others for local businessmen. They are being held at the local police station where the victim made her first complaint, but as of Monday had not yet been charged. The family said that the local police humiliated Ms. Kaur, asking her repeatedly to describe the crime in graphic detail. ""They asked very dirty questions,"" said Harvinder Kaur, 28, Ms. Kaur's cousin, who accompanied her to the police station. ""They even questioned her character."" She said the police asked Ms. Kaur, ""How many times have you had sex before?"" For over a month, the police did not arrest the three men, instead allowing village elders to try to broker a deal among the families. Elders wanted to get Ms. Kaur married to one of the men or pressured the family to settle the matter by accepting money. During this time, police officers constantly tried to dissuade the family from pursuing the complaint, Harvinder Kaur said. She recalled that they asked, ""How long will you keep running to the courts? What will you get from filing this complaint? You are poor; why don't you settle the matter?"" Forcing a rape victim to marry her rapists is a common practice in South Asia. At the prayer service for Ms. Kaur on Monday morning, at least two dozen people said marriage to an attacker is the ideal solution in cases of rape. ""In a small place, what will happen if everyone finds out?"" asked Raj Singh, the head of the panchayat, or the village's local government. ""This way, the girl's honor is saved, the family's honor is saved,"" he said. Gurinder Singh, 51, called it ""the most socially acceptable solution."" ""If the man and the woman can adjust, what's the problem?"" he said. In India, a woman who has been raped inevitably faces discrimination and social stigma. The people of Badshahpur said Ms. Kaur had been stripped of her ""respect"" and ""honor."" The reason she decided to take the matter to the police, Harvinder Kaur said, is that ""she had already lost her respect, so why won't she fight till the end?"" For fear of being shamed, Paramjeet Kaur moved to her cousin's house in the neighboring village of Samana, where for weeks, village elders and the men she accused pressured her to drop her complaint in exchange for money. ""She was scared,"" said Harvinder Kaur. ""So much had happened, and the accused were still roaming freely."" Paramjeet Kaur's family of six - her parents, two sisters and a brother - has a monthly income of less than $100. She lived with her parents and one sister in a dilapidated one-room house. A double bed takes up most of the space, and a small cupboard holds their few possessions. Her father, 60, works as a private security guard. After Ms. Kaur's death, the government of Punjab has given her older sister, Charanjit, a job as a peon in the state's revenue department. Ms. Kaur, who wanted to join the police force, had to drop out of school after ninth grade because the family could no longer pay for her education. They had mortgaged their house for $4,000 to send their only son to the Indian Army, where he is a junior officer. Since Ms. Kaur's death, action has been swift, partly because the state administration is keen to avoid protests of the kind that have swept Delhi for two weeks. Two officers were quickly dismissed, one of whom has been charged with abetting the suicide by failing to act on the woman's complaint, and a third officer has been suspended. ""They should have done their duty,"" said Shashi Prabha Diwedi, an inspector general and a member of a three-member team formed to investigate the case. Their job, she said, was to register the complaint when the victim approached them and to arrest the accused immediately.",2013,"India"
"176","India's Rape and Sexual Assault Laws Under Scrutiny","Asia","The death of a young rape victim in from Delhi has reopened a debate in India about the country's sexual assault and rape laws, as sweeping changes are being demanded to improve women's rights in the country. Compared to the much of the rest of the world, sections of India's laws covering rape are inadequate and narrowly defined, critics say. And India's way of delivering justice to rape victims is replete with loopholes, they say. The debate comes as the Indian government reviews the country's laws and punishments for sexual assault, in the wake of widespread protests and calls for judicial action. The government has formed a panel of three legal experts, headed by a former chief justice of India, J.S. Verma, to review possible amendments, including those that would impose more stringent punishment. The committee is expected to submit its report by the end of January. India's current definition of rape is steeped in outmoded traditions, making the possibility of a conviction unlikely in many cases, human rights activists said. The law, which dates from 1860, has been amended only twice since then, in 1983 and 2003. ""There is need for a much broader definition of rape, as is accepted by international standards,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Currently, section 375 of the Indian Penal Code is defined as vaginal-penile intercourse against a woman's consent. Excluded from the law is the rape of a woman by her husband if the woman is above 15 years of age. ""The world is changing, and because there are changes in society we need to modify the definition of the rape law,"" said Monica Joshi, a law officer at the Human Rights Law Network in New Delhi who specializes in women's cases. ""The law needs to include things like oral penetration, anal penetration, insertion of a foreign object into a woman's body, dating rape, marital rape and deal with direct and indirect consent."" Both Britain and most states in the United States consider marital rape a legal offense, noted Pinky Anand, a Supreme Court lawyer who specializes in cases for women, constitutional law and international law. Still, there is a ""progressive"" part of Indian law compared to laws in some parts of the United States and in Britain, said Mrinal Satish, an associate professor at the National Law University in Delhi, who is completing his doctoral dissertation at Yale Law School. In India, the prosecution is required to prove that the defendant knew that the woman was not consenting to intercourse and only relies on the victim's testimony, not the defendant's belief, Mr. Satish said. But this is also where the ambiguities arise. The court, said Mr. Satish, has to be satisfied that the woman's testimony is reliable. Stereotyping based on certain characteristics, like whether the victim is a virgin or married, plague judgments in rape cases and usually have a negative impact, he said. The current law also lacks clarity about punishments for a convicted rapist. According to section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, the minimum sentence for a convicted rapist is seven to 10 years, while the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. Gang rape carries a punishment of 10 years to life imprisonment. However, in certain situations a convicted rapist can get away with serving less time. ""The law allows the judge discretion to award a lesser punishment in special cases such as an aged person or a person of unsound mind,"" says Ujjwal Nikam, a special public prosecutor for the government of Maharashtra whose expertise is in criminal law. Sentencing guidelines for judges in India are nonexistent, which could lead to lenient sentences in rape cases, critics say. ""Unlike some other countries, such as the United States and England, India does not have sentencing guidelines, which provide rules and principles for judges to follow while sentencing,"" said Mr. Satish. This contributes to the ""rampant disparity"" in punishments for rape cases, he said. Legal experts in India are debating increasing the maximum punishment for rape in India, which could include the death penalty. Some activists and advocates believe that an enhancement in the punishment will create a greater deterrent against rape. ""The principle problem with rape laws in the country is that they don't seem to be serving enough of a deterrent to criminals,"" said Ms. Anand. ""The rate of rape is horrifying, and the conviction rate is unsatisfactory. Capital punishment is the only answer."" However, activists warn of the dangers of imposing the death penalty in rape cases, citing the increased chances that rapists would attempt to kill their victims, among other risks. Another punishment being considered is chemical castration, the administration of medication designed to decrease libido and sexual activity, which is used on sex offenders in South Korea, Russia and Israel. In the United States, chemical castration is used in California, Florida and Louisiana. Several legal experts argue there is also need to review the sexual assault law in India. Under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, sexual assault is described as ""outraging the modesty of a woman"" - a description considered archaic, subjective and limited by legal experts. ""We need to increase the ambit of sexual assault to include harassment, verbal abuse, groping, acid attacks, stalking and cyber crime,"" said Ms. Anand. Punishment for sexual assault should also be increased, activists said. Currently sexual assault crimes carry a maximum punishment of two years, but most convicted criminals can walk away by paying a small fee. ""Criminals who repeatedly commit sexual assault if not convicted will then progress to higher crimes like rape,"" said Ms. Anand. A sexual assault bill currently pending in Parliament introduces some of these measures by increasing the punishment for molestation from two years to five years in prison, and sexual harassment from one year to three years. The law itself is not the only problem. ""When it comes to the problems - they lie in the system and how the legal system deals with rape cases,"" Mr. Satish said. It's important that the evidence is built. And if that's weak, then the court is left with evidence on the bases it cannot convict."" A draft bill has been submitted to the panel by the ruling Congress Party suggests chemical castration of rapists in rare cases, longer sentences for rape and setting up fast-track courts. The bill should be named after the Delhi gang rape victim, Shashi Tharoor, the Indian minister of state for human resource development, said on Twitter on Jan. 1. The thought struck a chord with the victim's parents, according to local media reports. (The woman's name has only been reported so far by a British newspaper, which said it had the father's permission. Reports Monday said his permission had not been given.) Lawyers and activists are hopeful that the national attention garnered by this particular rape will spur the government to action.

Then on top of all that, I've been thinking of the events in Steubenville, Ohio, in which football players allegedly carted a comatose 16-year-girl around and raped her, possibly even urinated on her.

"179","India Moves to Strengthen Sexual Assault Laws","Asia","On Friday, a special meeting of the Union Cabinet approved an ordinance to strengthen laws to deal with sexual violence against women. While the ordinance approved some suggestions made by the Justice Verma Committee making stalking, voyeurism and acid attacks punishable under criminal law, it diverged on issues such as marital rape, capital punishment and the prosecution of armed forces personnel who commit sexual assaults. The ordinance has received a mixed response from lawyers and women's groups, who were agitating for more holistic legislation. ""This is a piecemeal and fragmented ordinance which seems to be more of an exercise to make an impact,"" said Kirti Singh, a senior advocate in the Supreme Court of India who specializes in women's issues. ""After twenty years of not doing anything they seem to be in a tremendous hurry to do something or the other to appease public sentiment."" The Dec. 16 rape and subsequent death of a young woman on a moving bus in India prompted a nationwide response and calls to improve India's legislation to curb sexual violence against women. On Jan. 23, a three-member committee headed by a retired Supreme Court chief justice, J.S. Verma, submitted its recommendations urging the government to act. In response, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged Wednesday to act quickly to adopt the committee's recommendations. Mr. Singh on Friday convened a special cabinet meeting to discuss the recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee, after which the ordinance was passed. The ordinance must be approved by President Pranab Mukherjee and passed by the Parliament to become law. ""The approval of the ordinance in an utmost expeditious manner is in response to the sensitivities of the people felt in the aftermath of the gruesome incident that happened on Dec. 16,"" Ashwani Kumar, the Union Law Minister, told the Indian Express. He said that the ordinance contains provisions of Verma Committee recommendations along with the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2012 that is pending in Parliament. The ordinance has accepted some of the recommendations made by the Justice Verma Committee such as making voyeurism, stalking and acid attacks punishable offenses. ""We welcome some of the things mentioned in the ordinance such as the inclusion of graded sexual abuse and harsher punishment for sexual offenses,"" said Annie Raja, general secretary of the National Federation of Indian Women. The recognition that the sexual history of the victim should not be an issue and addition of improved investigation procedures that require the presence of female police officers were also welcomed by women's rights activists. Contrasting with the recommendations made by the Verma Committee, the ordinance has introduced capital punishment for special cases of sexual violence that cause severe physical or mental damage, lead to death or leave the victim in a persistent vegetative state. The ordinance provides for varying degrees of punishment for rapists depending on the gravity of the crime such that the punishment for those convicted for rape can range from seven years to the death penalty. There has also been a special provision for gang rape, which entails a minimum punishment of 20 years and a maximum punishment of the death sentence. ""Every country is moving towards the elimination of death penalty and India is strengthening the legislation for death penalty,"" said Kavita Srivastava , the national secretary for the People's Union for Civil Liberties. ""Here we are still looking for an eye for an eye framework."" While the Dec. 16 gang rape revived debates about the application of the death penalty for rape and calls for the six accused men to be executed, legal experts believe that the provision of the death penalty is a regressive step. ""We have had a long experience of the court not even awarding the minimum sentence for rape,"" Ms. Singh said. ""Rather than the introduction of the death penalty, which seems like a knee-jerk reaction to public demands, there should be a provision for the certainty of punishment which ties down the discretion of the court."" Ms. Singh also said that the law should assure that a life sentence cannot be commuted and actually results in rigorous imprisonment for life. The ordinance also did not accept the suggestions of the Verma Committee that dealt with sexual violence among members of the armed forces and police personnel. The committee had asked for a removal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act that gives the armed forces immunity from prosecution and proposed that the senior police or army officer would be held responsible for a sexual offense committed by a junior officer. Other issues in which the government ordinance rejected the suggestions of the Verma committee are the incorporation of marital rape as a punishable criminal offense, the payment of compensation to victims of sexual violence and the lowering of the juvenile age from 18 to 16 years. The ordinance has also made the definition of rape gender neutral, rather than keeping it gender-specific to women as suggested by the Verma Committee. A statement issued by the All India Democratic Women's Association objected to what they described as the ""selective and arbitrary approach of the government"" with regards to the Verma Committee recommendations. ""The present piecemeal and fragmented ordinance can only serve to sabotage the intention of providing recourse to victims of sexual violence,"" the statement said. The introduction of an ordinance -- ahead of the budget session in parliament scheduled to begin later this month -- has been criticized by women's rights activists and lawyers. ""It is on the whole a very, very problematic ordinance that disregards many suggestions made by the Verma Committee,"" said Ms. Kavita Srivastava. ""It is too serious an issue for the cabinet to have gone ahead on its own, they could have waited for the budget session which is only twenty days away."" Activists said that they would be issuing responses to the ordinance and asking for the legislation to be debated in parliament. ""They should have convened a special parliament session to the debate the question of sexual violence against women and discuss the human resources and financial resources required to implement new measures,"" Ms. Raja said. ""Because it has taken the form of an ordinance, there is no room for discussion or debate. Legislation cannot be made on the basis of popular opinion.""",2013,"India"

As sarpanchs (village council leaders) and mukhiyas (district leaders) have the power to approve development projects and administer social welfare programs, the posts are highly coveted. Often violence is used to discourage women from contesting elections. Mr. Gupta lists a number of incidents in which women standing for village council elections or their husbands were attacked, murdered and mutilated. In the three village council elections since 2006, 191 people were killed in Bihar before and during elections. Rising violence along with continued gender discrimination have undermined the efficacy of the quota system for women in village council leadership. ""In the past five years, the number of widowed mukhiyas and sarpanchs has spiraled, casting doubt if the Bihar government's efforts to empower women were merely yet another political sop,"" Mr. Gupta concludes. In Tehelka, Kunal Majumder weighs in on last month's events in Bangladesh, where young Muslim activists took to the streets of Dhaka protesting the Islamist political group Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh in an assertion of secularism and nationalism. The protests were triggered on Feb. 5 when the War Crimes Tribunal, instituted by the government to try those accused of committing atrocities in Bangladesh's liberation war in 1971, handed down a life sentence to Abdul Kader Mollah, who was convicted of rape and mass murder. Many Bangladeshis had expected a death sentence for Mr. Mollah, who is often called the ""Butcher of Mirpur"" for slaughtering 344 people. In response to the sentence, four bloggers in their 20s - Imran H. Sarkar, Mahmadul Haq Munshi, Maruf Rosul and Amit Bikram Tripura - organized a protest near the National Museum adjacent to Shahbag Square. Within days, students from other universities joined the protest, which grew exponentially. The protesters demanded the death sentence for the perpetrators of war crimes, a ban on the Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing, which are associated with the war crimes committed during Bangladesh's liberation struggle, and a ban on enterprises controlled by the Jamaat. Mr. Majumder compares the youth protesting at Shahbag Square to the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria and Pakistan, where young Muslim populations massed on the streets. However, the critical difference in Bangladesh, Mr. Majumder writes, is that the young Muslims' demands were extremely un-Islamic. ""A young generation of Bangladeshis set out to recapture the legacy of their country's birth and reclaim the narrative of 1971, taking ownership of an event that occurred well before this generation was born,"" Mr. Majumder writes. ""Young Muslims came out on the streets, angry and impassioned. They were not advocating or emerging as the vanguard for Islamism; they were opposing it."" In Open, Rahul Pandita critiques the draft Jammu and Kashmir Police Bill 2013, which empowers local police and reduces police accountability. He notes that while the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, Omar Abdullah, has often publicly denounced the Armed Forces Special Powers Act that grants armed forces impunity, the draft Kashmir Police Bill gives similar powers to the state police. The bill, which has already stirred controversy in the Kashmir Valley, allows police personnel to bypass the district magistrate in law-and-order disputes. Other controversial parts of the act include allowing a police officer ""not authorized by rank or jurisdiction"" to keep a person in custody for six hours before a competent officer takes over and the authorization to create ""village defense committees"" and appoint civilians as special police officers. While the chief minister has said that the bill will only be passed after it goes through the state cabinet and both legislative houses, Mr. Pandita argues that Mr. Abdullah's inaction with regards to the bill has hurt himself by giving his opponents plenty of ammunition in this debate.",2013,"India"
"182","In India, Heated Debate Over Teens and Sex","Asia","NEW DELHI -Should it be illegal for 16-year-olds to have sex? What if they're married? That debate was reopened recently in India, as the government prepares a new criminal amendment designed to better protect women and punish sexual offenders. Up for discussion is lowering the age of consent from 18 to 16, which may reverse a law passed last year criminalizing all sex involving those under 18, even if it was consensual. The topic has dominated nightly news programs and spurred heated arguments on both sides. At its heart, the debate pits a growing push to protect children and young women from sexual assault in India against the realities of human sexuality, the lifting of taboos about casual sex and the country's longstanding patriarchal marriage traditions. In India, nearly one in every five women are married before the age of 15 and one in every two are married before the age of 18. There has been a sharp decline in marriages below the age of 15, but India still accounts for 40 percent of the world's child marriages. Outside of marriage, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that views on casual or recreational sex are changing, as interaction between young men and women increase and more Indians move away from family for work. ""It is quite normal for people to have sexual relations at 16 or 17 years of age,"" Indira Jaising, India's additional solicitor general, said in a telephone interview. ""How can we make illegal what is normal?"" By raising the age of consent last year to 18, India became one of the most conservative countries in the world. The age of sexual consent in Britain is 16; in France, it is 15, and in Spain, it is 13 years. In the United States, the age ranges from 16 to 18 years, depending on the state. India's Ministry of Women and Child Development maintains that those under 18 are not ""physically, psychologically and emotionally capable of handling sexual relations,"" a senior ministry official told India Ink. ""Children don't know what they getting into at that age,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be identified. This debate is a recent one in India. For decades, the age for sexual consent under India's penal laws was 16. Last year, however, the government passed the Prevention of Child Sexual Offenses Act in response to a government survey that found over 53 percent of children in India had experienced some form of sexual abuse. The law raised the age of consent to 18 amid intense debate and opposition. A sign of how divided government thinking was on the issue: the original version of the bill raised the age of consent to 18, but treated 16- to 18-year-olds differently by requiring that an exception be made for consensual sex. This was included to reflect what the government said was an ""emerging social reality regarding awareness, understanding and exposure of adolescents."" The law, however, was sent to a parliamentary committee, which recommended that the consent clause be omitted. The committee pointed to the fact that most other Indian laws, including contract law, juvenile justice and marriage laws, draw the line at 18 years. The Ministry of Women and Child Development also pointed to an observation in the standing committee report that lowering the age or making an exception for consensual sex puts the onus on young girls to prove they did not consent in the cases of sexual assault. ""The focus would be on the victim, which would invariably lead to revictimization of the victim,"" the report said, adding that this would be ""especially problematic when dealing with children."" In February, the government raised the age of consent to 18 in a hurriedly passed ordinance that amended India's criminal laws in response to the outrage that followed a fatal gang rape in New Delhi. In a recent note, however, Human Rights Watch criticized the increase in age of consent, saying Indian law should take into account ""adolescents' evolving capacity and maturity to make decisions"" about sex. ""The legal framework should help adolescents deal with their sexuality in an informed and responsible way, and not punish the same population that it is designed to protect,"" the note said. Advocates of a lower age of consent say the law can include safeguards to prevent child abuse. For instance, when a 16-year-old has had sexual relations with, say, a 40-year-old, the law could presume that consent was coerced or wrongfully obtained, because ""the balance of power in the relationship is skewed,"" Ms. Jaising said. But no law should criminalize ""normal and natural sexual relations"" between two people who are in the same age group and have consented to sex, she said. Some courts in India have endorsed this suggestion. In May 2012, Judge Kamini Lau said that in the absence of what she called a ""close-in-age reprieve,"" the increase in the age of consent ""would become regressive and draconian as it tends to criminalize adolescent sex. ""The need is to correct this behavior and not punish,"" she said. Those working on children's rights say they have seen this fallout first hand, as boys having consensual sex with 16- to 18-year-old girls are exposed to prosecution. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which is advocating for the age of consent to be lowered to 16, says children's homes are full of boys who have eloped or had consensual sex with young girls whose disapproving parents have filed cases of kidnapping and rape against the boys. ""It is being used widely as a weapon by protective parents,"" said Nina Nayak, a member of the commission. ""This puts young boys, and sometimes even girls, in a hostile legal environment."" India's courts too have raised similar concerns. Criticizing the raising of the age of consent to 18, Virender Bhat, an additional sessions judge, said last year, ""Such a move would open the floodgates for prosecution of boys for offenses of rape on the basis of complaints by girls' parents irrespective of whether the girl was a consenting party."" But those who oppose a lower age of consent ask why teenagers should be considered adult enough to make decisions about sex at 16 when they can't drive, vote or get married until they are 18. ""Are you trying to say that if you are sexually active, please have premarital sex till 18 and then get married?"" asked Harish Salve, a prominent lawyer, during a television debate. ""That's a very wrong message."" Lost in the debate over the legal age of consent, say some observers, is whether the government should be playing a role at all in deciding who is allowed to have intercourse. Instead, they argue, young people should get the necessary information to decide for themselves. ""The debate is starting at the wrong end of the stick, and it leaves everyone vulnerable,"" said Naina Kapur, a lawyer and women's rights activist. ""We have nothing resembling sex education in India to allow young people to make informed choices."" Judge Bhat raised the same concerns about the government's role in deciding a case last year. ""Good virtues cannot be inculcated, and good conscience cannot be imbibed in a child by legal provisions,"" he said, adding that, this job would be better left to parents and schoolteachers.",2013,"India"
"183","India Moves Towards Stronger Law to Protect Women","Asia","India's lower house of Parliament passed a bill Tuesday intended to better protect women from sex crimes, widely hailed as a step forward in India's attempt to deter sexual offenders after the fatal gang rape of a young woman in Delhi in December sparked a nationwide movement to improve women's security. ""We feel that when such serious and heinous crimes start occurring with alarming regularity, the time has come to send a loud and clear deterrent signal to all potential criminals that society will no longer tolerate such aberrant behavior,"" Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said when introducing the bill in the Lok Sabha, the lower house. The bill would ""plug loopholes"" in the justice system, Mr. Shinde said. The bill establishes significantly tougher punishments for sexual offenses, including the death penalty in cases where a rape leaves the victim dead or in a ""persistent vegetative state.""  It also creates several new sexual offenses, such as stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment; makes the throwing of acid on women a specific criminal offense; and prescribes punishment for police officers who fail to file initial reports when women come forward with a complaint. The bill now goes to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, where the government hopes it will pass before Friday, when Parliament goes on a monthlong break. If passed, the bill will replace an ordinance that was passed hurriedly by the government in February, which was widely criticized for taking a piecemeal approach to women's rights and is set to expire on April 4. In the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, debate over the bill lasted more than six hours, but fewer than 200 of the 540 members were present when it was brought to a vote. Parliamentarians were divided on several issues, chiefly whether the age of consent for sex should be 16 or 18. The government has flip-flopped on this question; an ordinance passed in February raised the age of consent to 18, but an early draft of the bill now being considered would have lowered it to 16 again. That provision was removed after a meeting of all major political parties on Monday, at which the Bharatiya Janata Party and others objected to lowering the age of consent. During the debate, Sandeep Dikshit of the Congress party asked, ""Should we criminalize consensual physical relations between a 17-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl?""  But several lawmakers argued that reducing the age of consent to 16 would encourage teenage sex and send a signal at odds with the cultural traditions of India, where the legal age for marriage is 18. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a member of the Shiromani Akali Dal, asked what the consequences of lowering of the age of consent would be ""when there is no sex education in schools and no education on contraception."" Such a move would lead to a rise  in teenage pregnancies and abortions, Ms. Badal said. Several parliamentarians blamed a host of cultural factors for a  perceived increase in sex crimes, from the influence of Western culture to television advertisements for condoms and provocative films. ""It's natural,"" said Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United), to feel titillated when watching what are called ""item songs,"" or song and dance numbers common in Bollywood. Leaders from several regional parties, like the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Janata Dal (United), objected to the bill's definitions of stalking and voyeurism, saying they would lead to a rush of false cases.  Female parliamentarians responded that their colleagues were expressing a mistrust of women. ""Which law has never been misused?"" asked Priya Dutt of the Congress party. ""But you make laws for the benefit of the majority of the people."" Other lawmakers argued that the provisions on stalking were not strong enough. Sushma Swaraj of the B.J.P. argued that men arrested on suspicion of stalking even for the first time should not be automatically eligible for release on bail. Most legislators seemed to agree on one thing: that while India does have laws in place to protect women and girls, such as laws against domestic violence and child marriage, implementation remains poor. ""What is the strategy for implementation of the bill?"" asked Sumitra Mahajan of the B.J.P. ""This train has 10 compartments lined up but no engine.""",2013,"India"
"184","India Passes Sweeping Bill on Crimes Against Women","Asia","NEW DELHI - Less than three months after a New Delhi woman who was gang raped on a moving bus died from her injuries, India's Parliament passed a comprehensive bill that imposes stronger penalties on men who attack women and criminalizes offenses like stalking and voyeurism. The bill quickly cleared the upper house, or Rajya Sahba, of Parliament on Thursday, after being debated for seven hours in the lower house on Tuesday. President Pranab Mukherjee is expected to sign it into law shortly. ""I think this is an important moment,"" said Vrinda Grover, a women's rights activist and lawyer. ""We have taken quite a few steps forward."" The Dec. 16 gang rape and assault of a physiotherapy student, and her subsequent death, prompted widespread and sometimes violent protests in India. Citizens, activists and many politicians demanded the government do more to protect women and impose harsher sentences on the men who molest them. Reported rapes in India have risen in recent years, and northern India has witnessed a series of highly publicized gang rapes. The bill, which amends India's criminal laws, is intended to deter and punish sexual offenders, including men who stalk and harass women, and to create a more responsive police and judicial system, which is widely criticized as being insensitive when dealing with crimes against women. It expands the definition of rape, substantially increases the punishment for sex crimes like gang rape, introduces the death penalty for repeat offenders and criminalizes activities like disrobing and voyeurism. India's democracy has often been faulted for being so unruly and its Parliament so dysfunctional that fundamental, vital development issues, like malnutrition and education, are inadequately addressed. The fact that the bill passed both houses of Parliament even as they adjourned unexpectedly several times this week, after a key ally of the governing Congress Party abandoned it, is a sign that the demands of thousands of protesters were heard, activists said. ""It is good that India still responds as a democracy when there is pressure from citizens,"" Meenakshi Ganguly, the director of Human Rights Watch in South Asia, said. ""The terrible attack in Delhi, and the protests that followed, ensured that both the opposition and the government cooperated in ensuring that this law was enacted."" India's cabinet ministers were quick to praise the bill's passage. ""The bill is significant as it aims to protect mothers and sisters of this country,"" said India's minister of home affairs, Sushil Kumar Shinde, on Thursday in the Rajya Sabha, according to the Press Trust of India. ""Over years, such a stringent law has not been made,"" he said. Although opposition politicians were unsatisfied. Nirmala Sitharaman, the national spokeswoman for the Bharatiya Janata Party, the leading opposition party, said the government could have done more with this bill. ""I wish the discussion around the bill would have been more substantive in both the houses,"" she said. ""This is a step forward, but the government could have done more homework to bring about a stronger legislation."" In crafting the bill, the government included many of the recommendations of a report submitted in January by a panel headed by former Chief Justice J.S. Verma, which suggested far-reaching changes in the legal and justice system. The three-member panel consulted hundreds of activists, laws of other countries and literature on criminal psychology to recommend changes that would help fight discrimination against women. Among the report's recommendations adopted by government were the creation of stalking, voyeurism and disrobing as separate offenses, provisions to punish police officers who failed to register complaints of sexual offenses and a broadening of the definition of rape to include the insertion of an object or any other body part into a woman's vagina, urethra or anus. The law went against the report's suggestions by adopting the death penalty in some rape cases and raising the age of consent for sex to 18. Many activists are encouraged by the bill, but say public debate and reforms for gender equality must continue. ""The spectrum of change India requires is much, much broader than amendments to the criminal laws,"" said Ms. Grover, the lawyer. ""We need to really focus on enforcement and implementation."" Others said the bill was a disappointment. Sandhya Valluripally, president of the Progressive Organization of Women, said that women's organizations had been demanding for years a bill that offers complete protection for women from sexual harassment. She said she thought the bill that was passed Thursday has fallen short of that. Many of the Verma committee recommendations were missing in the bill, she noted. ""There are so many recommendations that were rejected by the government of India,"" she said, saying that her group is against the death penalty and wanted child trafficking to be considered rape. She also was critical of the discussions that took place in Parliament on the bill. ""The discussions were derogatory to women,"" she said.

"185","Japan Can Champion Women's Rights","Asia","''THEY started to drag us away, one by one. ... I hid under the table, but was soon found. ... The Japanese officer ... took his sword out of its scabbard and pointed it at me, threatening me with it, that he would kill me if I did not give in to him. I curled myself into a corner, like a hunted animal that could not escape.'' Thus, Jan Ruff O'Herne, a Dutch woman born in Java in 1923, recounted the abuse she suffered at the hands of the Japanese military as a World War II ''comfort woman,'' or sexual slave, at a 2007 U.S. House subcommittee hearing. This was only the first of the rapes that she would endure every day and night for months after she had been ''forcibly seized'' from a Japanese civilian internment camp at age 19 and brought to a brothel for Japanese servicemen. O'Herne was one of up to 200,000 mostly Korean, but also Chinese, Dutch, Japanese, Filipino, Indonesian and other women coerced into sexual servitude by the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces. In 1993, after decades of official denials, Yohei Kono, the chief cabinet secretary, issued a formal admission and apology to the women following an extensive government study. Many conservatives in Japan have never accepted the so-called Kono Statement, most notably Shinzo Abe, the new prime minister. On Thursday, the new chief cabinet secretary of the Abe government, Yoshihide Suga, said that historians and other experts should re-examine the Kono Statement. Knowing the shaky ground on which the apology stands amid longstanding conservative calls to rescind or revise it, what many comfort women have sought is an official Japanese government apology (a cabinet decision) and state compensation. This seems as far from becoming reality as it has in the last two decades. This type of revisionist atmosphere has become a significant obstacle to smooth relations between Japan and its neighbors. It is also of profound concern to the United States, two of whose most important allies in the region are Japan and South Korea, which are at odds over the comfort women issue. But this is not only a matter of Japan's foreign relations, U.S. strategic interests, or history. Its global import is inextricably tied to the real-life circumstances of women and girls in conflict-ridden zones and other unsafe situations throughout the world today. When the U.S. House passed a resolution in 2007 calling on Japan to acknowledge and apologize for the ''coercion of young women into sexual slavery'' during the 1930s and 1940s, the comfort women issue was immediately reframed as one of women's rights and human rights. Since then, the comfort women issue has gained wide support nationally and internationally because of the plight of women and girls caught up in the brutal business of human trafficking. The United Nations reports that there are 2.4 million current victims of human trafficking, 80 percent of whom are being used as sexual slaves. Sexual violence (defined by the U.N. as including rape and forced prostitution) also continues to be part of the reality of armed conflict, as we have seen in Bosnia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Libya. This is not a history issue, nor solely a Japan-South Korea issue. It is a human rights and women's rights issue. Last month, Japanese voters put the Liberal Democratic Party back in power. One of the characteristics that Japanese citizens clearly thirst for in the new government is leadership. Thus far, Abe has chosen to display his leadership qualities, in part, by emphasizing historical revisionism. This will probably not take him very far, as evidenced by his previous short-lived stint as prime minister in 2006-2007. During that one-year term, Abe challenged claims that women had been coerced into becoming comfort women but later apologized to the women ''as prime minister'' and ultimately stood by the Kono Statement. Given the mood of the Japanese public, it is unlikely that there will be much movement on the comfort women issue by this government. Still, an opportunity exists to transform the debate, to instill national pride in the country's young people by making Japan a protector of human rights and a defender of the disempowered on the global stage, and to take concrete steps so that problems of sexual servitude and rape in war actually do become issues of history.

"186","Urging Action, Report on Brutal Rape Condemns India's Treatment of Women","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Women in India face systemic discrimination and are regularly confronted with sexual harassment and violence, even as the police often fail to provide protection and the government has failed to enforce laws and policies intended to safeguard women's rights, according to a scathing special report released on Wednesday. The government report, drafted in response to the deadly gang rape of a young woman last month in New Delhi, amounted to a broad and damning indictment of the treatment of women by India's democratic institutions. It also was intended as a call to action: the three-person commission, led by a former chief justice of India's Supreme Court, challenged Parliament to act swiftly on its recommendations. ''We have submitted the report in 29 days,'' the retired chief justice, J.S. Verma, said during a nationally televised news conference, noting that the commissioners worked quickly in order to present their findings before Parliament next meets in February. ''If we are able to do it in half the time available, the government, with its might and resources, should also act fast.'' The commission recommended a number of far-reaching changes. Among them were requiring police officers to register every case of reported rape; punishing crimes like stalking and voyeurism with prison terms; changing the humiliating medical examinations endured by rape victims; re-examining every appointed state police chief in the country; cracking down on extralegal village councils, known as khap panchayats, which often issue edicts against women; and making new legal requirements so it is much more difficult for people charged with criminal offenses to hold political office. India does not lack adequate laws on sexual violence or gender bias, the commissioners found, but rather lacks the political and bureaucratic will to enforce them. ''Failure of good governance is the obvious root cause for the current unsafe environment eroding the rule of law, and not the want of needed legislation,'' the report said. India's government has often proved immutable to calls for progressive reform. Over the years, different commissions have issued recommendations on a variety of subjects, only to see their reports gather dust. Indeed, even a major 2006 Supreme Court ruling calling for significant changes in policing remains largely stalled, with its recommendations far from being put in place. But public outrage over the brutal Dec. 16 gang rape of a young woman on a private bus moving through New Delhi has remained fierce, prompting political leaders to promise swift action. The trial of the five adult defendants in the case is expected to begin as soon as Thursday in a new fast-track court. Moreover, many lawmakers have promised legislative changes to address shortcomings in policing and gender bias. ''Women must enjoy freedom,'' said Leila Seth, herself a former Supreme Court justice and one of the commission's three members, speaking at the news conference. ''The state must practice equality.'' The commission, with Justice Verma as chairman, was created last month by India's Home Ministry and charged with making recommendations to improve laws dealing with sexual violence. Justice Verma said that public interest was extremely high and that the commission received more than 80,000 suggestions. He praised the youthful protesters whose demonstrations over the rape case created mounting pressure on the government. Rather than focusing on narrow changes in criminal law, the commission's sweeping report goes beyond the issue of rape to assess widespread discrimination against women, societal biases against daughters, workplace sexual harassment, child sexual abuse, the trafficking of women and children and the deep-rooted problems with Indian policing. In particular, the commission said that many states still needed to comply with the 2006 Supreme Court ruling, which, among other mandates, called for eliminating political influence over police departments, notably in the appointment of police chiefs. Moreover, the commission called on the police to prevent stalking and other harassment on public transportation and urged the construction of separate facilities inside police precincts for women and improved officer training for investigating sex crimes. But, most of all, the commission urged what it called holistic changes, including nationwide education campaigns on gender equity and related issues. Indeed, blame was not affixed solely on the Indian state. Justice Verma said the Dec. 16 rape case also exposed a shameful public apathy, noting that many motorists drove past the half-naked victim and her beaten male friend after the suspects had dumped them on the side of a busy highway. ''The nation has to account for the tears of millions of women,'' the report concluded.",2013,"India"

"188","In India, Women's Issues Are Finally Out Front","Asia","Having recently returned to the United States from a four-year assignment in India, I'm often asked about events in that country. And so it was with the brutal rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi in December that set off big protests across India and was covered widely around the world. Why has this particular rape inspired so much outrage, people ask, when sexual violence is, sadly, so pervasive and commonplace there? The savagery of the attack and the young woman's inspiring story as the first in her poor family to pursue an advanced education and a career in medicine made this case deeply affecting. But this kind of crime and public awareness of it should not be seen as exceptional. In fact, outrage about the mistreatment and abuse Indian women suffer on a daily basis has been building over the last two decades. The rape in December may have drawn great public anguish because it came to symbolize the collected grievances of hundreds of millions of women. Devesh Kapur, who leads the Center for Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that gender violence is coming to the fore as a public issue partly because India is now less divided by other big fault lines: religion and caste. India has not achieved universal communal harmony, but violence between Hindus and Muslims or members of different castes has declined, especially in the last 10 years. ''For 20 years, or at least 15 years, India was obsessed at least in the chattering classes with two cleavages: religion and caste,'' he said. ''The other cleavage, which is gender, was ignored.'' Those communal tensions have subsided thanks in part to two decades of faster economic growth. As that was happening, public attention shifted to issues that had always been below the surface and cut across religious and caste lines, including violence against women. The attention partly reflects the impressive gains Indian women and girls have made in education and health: female literacy jumped to 66 percent in 2011 from 54 percent a decade earlier, and maternal mortality fell by nearly half from 1998 to 2009. Another big factor is the nation's changing demographics: more than half of the population is 25 years or younger. This group appears to be more socially aware and liberal and is starting to find its voice. College students, for instance, organized many of the protests after the New Delhi rape. Young people and an increasingly activist news media helped force politicians to respond to the Delhi rape case by quickly bringing suspects to trial and setting up a commission led by a former Supreme Court chief justice. The commission issued a thorough and scathing report on violence against women and last week Parliament passed a law adopting some of its recommendations. The new law is incomplete. It does not, for instance, allow a married woman to file rape charges against her husband. But it did break new ground by defining stalking, a big problem, as a crime for the first time. India has a notoriously poor record in enforcing laws and this statute is very likely to suffer from that deficiency because it will be enforced by corrupt, poorly trained police officers. But the fact that it was adopted at all is a small step forward. Another development that some find hope in is that women are reporting more rapes. Experts say this suggests that women are more willing to speak out and are having more success in getting police officers to register their complaints, which they are very reluctant to do. The number of reported rapes per 100,000 people increased by 28 percent from 2001 to 2011 even as the incidence of other violent crimes like murder and rioting fell. The absolute numbers of rape cases, however, remain tiny for a country of 1.2 billion people: the government recorded just 24,206 rape cases in 2011, or about 2 per 100,000 citizens. By contrast, American authorities recorded 26.8 rape cases per 100,000 people that year (not including statutory rape cases). ''To the extent that reporting has increased because women feel more empowered and willing to come forward rather than suffer in silence, the increased reporting could represent good rather than bad news,'' Rupa Subramanya, a Mumbai-based author and columnist, wrote recently. She and Vivek Dehejia, an economist, highlighted the increased reporting of rapes in their recent book, ''Indianomix: Making Sense of Modern India.'' Real change will happen when norms and mores evolve. Most Indian families, like most Chinese or Vietnamese families, are still patriarchal and strongly prefer boys to girls, a preference they often exercise by aborting female fetuses. That historical preference has left large parts of India with many more young men than women, which partly explains the phenomenon of gang rapes. Yet, traditional views about women's place in society and the home are changing. The fact that the parents of the Delhi student knew that she was out watching a movie with a male friend the night she was raped is striking. Until about 15 years ago most unmarried couples would rarely venture out alone in public and would certainly not tell their parents about it. Indian women are not as marginalized as they once were, and the reaction to this senseless death provides hope that bigger changes are coming.",2013,"India"
"189","Women Strip, Beat Politician Accused of Rape in North East India","Asia","As India awaits sentencing of the men who gang-raped a young woman in Delhi, a politician was arrested on rape charges in the northeastern state of Assam, then stripped and beaten by a crowd. Bikram Singh Brahma, a member of the Congress Party in Assam and president of a district Congress committee in the state, was arrested Thursday for the alleged rape of a woman in Chirang, according to police officials. ""A case has been registered against him under I.P.C. 376 by the lady's husband,"" G.P. Singh, the zonal inspector general of police, said in a telephone interview, referring to the section of the Indian penal code that applies to rape. Sanjit Krishna, the superintendent of police in the area, said in an interview that Mr. Brahma was also beaten and stripped by local women. Local television stations showed footage of several women ripping off Mr. Brahma's shirt and smacking him on the face and stomach before several men join in to hit him. Mr. Brahma attacked the woman last night while he was staying at her family's house, Mr. Singh said on Thursday. ""He was staying at their house, and under what circumstances will be the subject matter of the investigation,"" he added.",2013,"India"
"190","Lawmakers in India Charged With Crime Could Face Speedier Trials","Asia","India's Supreme Court on Friday asked the government to consider fast-tracking trials of lawmakers who are facing criminal charges, lawyers said, after activists filed a petition demanding legislators accused of abusing women be disqualified from public office. Six state legislators have charges of rape against them, and 36 have been charged with other crimes against women, according to a Dec. 20 report by the Association for Democratic Reforms. The Supreme Court rejected activists' demands that these lawmakers be suspended from their offices when charged, saying the court was not empowered to make such a decision. The activists' demands were part of two sweeping public interest litigations reviewed by the court on Friday, filed in response to a recent gang rape in Delhi that resulted in the death of a 23-year-old woman. The government has announced several measures in response to outrage over the gang rape in recent weeks, including faster courts, women's hotlines and an initiative to review the country's rape law. Civil society groups and activists, however, are demanding broader reforms. The Supreme Court on Friday asked the government to respond to several requests, including the establishment of fast-track courts in all states to try sex offenses, the formulation of judicial norms for the payment of compensation to rape victims, the filling of vacancies in the police force, the creation of a national toll-free helpline for victims of rape and child abuse and the creation of a registry of convicted sexual offenders to be circulated among the police force. The court rejected a demand for a reduction in security for high-profile figures like politicians and diplomats, which many say reduces the police force for other citizens, and for the investigation of crimes against women by female officers only. ""We have asked for many systemic changes,"" said Promilla Shankar, one of the petitioners and a former government officer who worked in India's administrative services. ""What is needed is a complete overhaul of the judicial and governance system."" India's top court has already given directions on many of the changes activists are demanding. In November, while considering a case on ""Eve-teasing,"" a term used in South Asia to mean sexual harassment, the court directed the government to deploy female police officers in all busy public places, held the managers of places like educational institutions, worship houses and movie theaters responsible for preventing sexual abuse, and required operators of public vehicles to report cases of harassment to the police. In Ms. Shankar'spetition, the Supreme Court was asked to suspend ""tainted"" police officers, government officials and members of Parliament and legislative assemblies who are facing rape or murder charges. The petition also demanded that the trials of these high-profile suspects be expedited, and if they are found guilty, they should be dismissed. In India, a lawmaker convicted by a lower court can keep his position by appealing the decision in a higher court. These cases often continue for years, if not decades. ""Lawmakers should be people of a certain character and caliber,"" Ms. Shankar said. ""What can the people expect if their representatives have criminal cases pending against them?"" Activists have also objected to political parties who field candidates with criminal charges pending. In the 2009 general elections, six candidates, from various parties, had been charged with rape, and in the last five years, political parties have nominated 27 candidates with rape charges against them, according to the report by the Association for Democratic Reforms, a nonprofit that works for electoral reforms. These cases represent a ""minuscule number"" of actual crimes, said Anil Bairwal, the organization's national coordinator, as a large number of such crimes are not reported, and politicians are able to use their considerable influence to prevent prosecution. In an effort to ""name and shame"" the accused politicians, the report includes their names and political parties and details the charges against them. ""These are the people in whose hands the people have given the country, so to speak,"" said Mr. Bairwal. ""This is not a small matter."" Petitions filed by the Association for Democratic Reforms over a decade ago resulted in an order that requires candidates to declare their financial, educational and criminal background, but only those who have been convicted of a crime are disqualified from running for office. A separate petition to disallow candidates who are facing criminal charges has been pending in the courts since 2005. ""A much simpler solution is to put pressure on political parties not to have candidates who have criminal charges,"" said Jagdeep Chhokar, one of the founders of the Association for Democratic Reforms. ""But that is not happening in this country because of the obstinacy or shamelessness of the political parties."" Public anger poured out in Assam this week against a Congress politician, Bikram Singh Brahma, who was accused of raping a married woman. Television footage showed a bare-chested man being beaten by a group of women shortly before his arrest. Mr. Brahma was subsequently suspended from his party.",2013,"India"

"192","Will Tourism in India Be Affected by Delhi Gang Rape?","Asia","For the prospective traveler, India conjures up several images: the iconic Taj Mahal, the snow-covered peaks of the Himalayas, the bustling chaos of crowded cities, the gorgeous architecture of the temples of south India. But these enchanting scenes might be overshadowed by another picture of India, one that is far grimmer. While India attempts to enhance its image in the eyes of foreign tourists, a high-profile rape case in Delhi has raised concerns about the safety of female travelers to the country. On Dec.16, a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped and beaten on a moving bus by six people, while her male companion was brutally attacked. The crime and the woman's subsequent death garnered international attention. The media scrutiny comes after a solid year for Indian tourism. A year-end review by India's Department of Tourism found that during the period January to November 2012 India saw approximately 5.9 million foreign tourists, an increase of about 6 percent from the same period in the previous year. In 2012, the department introduced a number of initiatives aimed at improving the image of the country overseas. An ongoing advertising campaign called ""Incredible India"" has made its way to billboards across the world, in an attempt to create awareness and boost tourism in India. In the days following the attack, while thousands poured out onto the streets of New Delhi to protest the rape, the embassies of the United States and Britain issued advisories advising their citizens to avoid parts of New Delhi. An advisory issued by the United States on Dec. 22 told American citizens to avoid the areas near India Gate and Rashtrapati Bhavan on Raisina Hill, where large demonstrations were being held to protest the government's inaction on crimes against women. The notice further advised citizens to stay tuned to local newspapers for the latest news and warned that ""demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn violent."" Officials in India greeted the advisories with disdain. Indian politicians from across party lines issued statements saying that they felt that the warnings were uncalled for. At the event to introduce the ""Incredible India"" calendar, the tourism secretary, Parvez Dewan, said that the travel advisories issued by the United States and the United Kingdom had not affected the flow of foreign tourists to the country. ""So far there has been no adverse impact on tourism. Since the advisory not a single cancellation of booking has taken place, according to tour operators,"" he said. Tour operators say that while some prospective visitors have raised concerns, there have not been any cancellations. ""Some tourists have e-mailed in asking whether it would be safe to travel, but no one has said that they have changed their mind about traveling to India,"" said Gour Kanjilal, the executive director of the Indian Association of Tour Operators. ""A heinous act took place, and people have protested peacefully as is expected in a democracy."" Parikshat Laxminarayan, managing director and co-founder of the tour agency Enchanting India, said his company had not received any cancellations over safety concerns. ""We believe that India is still among the safest countries in the world for men and women and especially for travelers,"" he said. However, travel agencies routinely recommend specific safety measures for female tourists in India. Mr. Kanjilal said that tour operators always recommend that female travelers exercise vigilance and visit tourist spots within certain hours. Arun Varma, the chief executive at Prime Travels, said that following the Delhi gang rape he had received some queries about safety from clients in the United States and Europe. ""We issue, as part of our standard operating procedures, an advisory to clients not to have ladies travel alone late nights or venture out to areas that are not part of the itinerary unless accompanied by a male friend or a local trustworthy contact,"" he said. For some tourists, the recent events have only reaffirmed concerns about their safety in India. Alyse Andalman, a 26-year-old from Chicago, was en route to India to attend a wedding when she heard about the rape case. While she did not consider canceling her trip, she recalled being frightened by the reports of the case. ""Even Indian friends of mine warned me that, as a single female, there were certain things I should steer clear of due to safety concerns,"" she said. ""I had my guard up before I left, and this story verifies that I was justified in that regard.""",2013,"India"
"193","India Rape Trial Starts With Renewed Ban on Media Coverage","Asia","The trial of five men accused in the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a moving bus in New Delhi is being watched closely as a symbol of India's commitment to justice for women, but information about the ongoing court proceedings may be scarce. As court proceedings began Thursday, the presiding judge said  there would be a blanket ban on reporting on the trial. The judge, Yogesh Khanna,  also warned defense lawyers, who have been openly speaking about the case, not to provide information about the proceedings to the press. The five men accused in the Dec. 16 rape and murder of a physiotherapy student were ushered into the special fast-track court in South Delhi on Thursday at noon, flanked by policemen, with their faces were covered with gray woolen caps. During the two-hour court proceedings, the prosecution used the opening arguments to lay out charges against the men, which include gang rape, murder, robbery and destruction of evidence. The police allege that the five accused men and a sixth teenager, who is being tried as a juvenile, committed a premeditated, vicious crime that included plans to kill their victim. The woman died nearly two weeks after the rape from injuries suffered during the attack, which included an assault with an iron rod. Her companion, a 29-year-old man, was also beaten, and is expected to testify at the trial. The court proceedings took place in room 305 of the Saket District Court complex, a small wood-paneled chamber. The next hearing will be on Monday, when the defendants' lawyers will respond to the charges the prosecution has laid out. Separately on Thursday, India's Juvenile Justice Board rejected a plea that the juvenile, who according to school records is 17 years old, be tried as an adult. The petition, filed by Subramanian Swamy, president of the Janata Party, claimed that the extreme malice of the alleged actions of the juvenile showed that he was not of the ""tender age and mind"" of a juvenile. Indian law requires that rape cases be held ""in-camera,"" allowing only those directly connected with the case to be present in the courtroom, to protect the victim's identity, and bans publishing of information about the proceedings. The victim has not been named by the media, but her family has spoken openly to the press about her life and their willingness to let her name be used if it were for something that benefitted the public, like new legislation to protect women. Some are agitating for the proceedings of this trial to be made public, because of the high profile nature of the case. ""In this case, what is on trial is the criminal justice system -- investigating agencies, the administration and the judiciary,"" said Meenakshi Lekhi, a Delhi-based lawyer who has filed a petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the media ban.  The case has ""brought women's rights to the center stage of public discourse,"" she said. ""This would not have been possible without the media,"" she said. The High Court will hear the petition on February 13. The new fast-track court will try only cases related to crimes against women, and once trials have started, they will not adjourn for weeks or months, as is common in other courts. Several fast-track courts have already  been set up in Delhi to hear crimes against women in the wake of the Delhi gang rape, which brought thousands of protesters to the streets demanding justice for the victim and other victims of sexual assault. Judge Khanna ordered  Monday that all court proceedings in ths current case would take place ""in camera,"" allowing only those directly connected with the case to be present in the courtroom, reiterating an earlier magistrate's order on the case. He also renewed a blanket ban Monday on the printing or publishing of any information relating to the case's proceedings. Defense lawyers were instructed by the court during the proceedings to ""honor the spirit"" of the gag order, they said, after the special public prosecutor Dayan Krishnan said he would file a petition of contempt of court if lawyers for the defendants continued to brief the media on developments. V. K. Anand, the lawyer for Ram Singh, one of the accused, confirmed Thursday that he would now also represent Mr. Singh's brother Mukesh. Mr. Anand and Vivek Sharma, a second lawyer for accused, told the media after Thursday's court proceedings that they could not answer any further questions.",2013,"India"
"194","Share Your Views on Violence Against Women in India","Asia","Sexual assault and violence against women is an enduring problem in India that came to the fore this winter, when the country was galvanized by the savage rape - and subsequent death - of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi. Her attack in December was followed by weeks of protests and vigils across India, where neither the police nor the judicial system is seen as adequately protecting women and girls. Tomorrow, Jan. 29, marks the one-month anniversary of the woman's death. December's protests broadened into condemnations of a government whose aggressive response to protests seemed tone deaf and, at times, incompetent.

"195","Your Suggestions on Curbing Violence Against Women in India","Asia","The trial of five of the six suspects in the New Delhi gang rape case that has captured worldwide attention began on Tuesday, just as the Indian government moved to strengthen its sexual assault laws in response to public outrage. Last week, we asked you to weigh in on what needs to be done to end the enduring problem of sexual assault and violence against women in India, and you offered a wide range of solutions. Some readers suggested castration of child rapists. Others offered support for the death penalty in violent cases. One argued that women should change how they dress and boys who reached a mature age should be encouraged to marry. Overwhelmingly, your comments contended that change depends on reforming the police and justice system and addressing deep-rooted cultural attitudes. ""While none can forget or forgive the perpetrators of such a heinous crime, we tend to forget that the reason for them to occur is a brutal and corrupt police force. A force that knows no accountability,"" wrote Gautam Nellore Reddy from Bangalore, India. Police should be treated as ""an accessory to the crime if they don't register a complaint"" and as an accomplice if they suppress information, Mr. Reddy wrote. In addition to holding the police accountable for how they handle - or fail to handle - cases of violence against women, as well as arguing the need for more female police officers, Vijayendra Kumar of Washington, D.C., encouraged changes in India's court system. ""It may be a good idea to have [a] special unit for handling all violence against women and the unit should be headed by a woman,"" Mr. Kumar wrote. ""It is also very necessary to establish courts dealing with women's issues with a mandate that judgments be delivered in a time-bound manner."" A number of readers, including Mr. Kumar, also said that reforms in the police and judicial systems would only be short-term fixes. To address the abuse and violence in the long term, they responded, India needs a change in mindset and attitudes. ""Fast-track courts, greater women police, a sensitized male police force, all these actions are merely applying Band-Aids to a broken leg,"" wrote Dr. Shireen Hyrapiet of Oregon State University. ""There exists a culture of the inferiority of women which cannot and will not change unless the government and people are on the same page and equally committed to bringing about change."" Some also suggested that bringing about such a change in attitudes through education, media and social practices. Annu Palakunnathu Matthew, a photography professor at the University of Rhode Island, grew up in India and remembers facing sexism as a young person. ""I called those years 'my angry young woman' days,"" she wrote in a comment to The Times, adding that India now needs a cultural shift of attitudes. ""Expecting women to, for example, wear long overcoats is not a serious way to resolve the problem."" In a project called ""Bollywood Satirized,"" Ms. Matthew uses digital technology to alter Indian movie posters and make a commentary on gender norms and traditional roles in Indian society. A poster labeled #DELHIRAPE she created in response to the recent case displays the headline ""From the Director of 'Out of Touch Politicians.' "" Others who responded to our question said they believed that cultural change could be brought about by focusing on the lessons Indian children learn at home as well as through improving their education about sexual assault in schools. A reader who gave the name Swati recommended that the Indian media put out public service announcements with male movie stars and athletes promoting the message, ""Real men do not rape."" Another, David Raney from Chapel Hill, N.C., presented a particularly creative idea. He said that Indian society should start practicing a new ritual based around respecting women. One day, he said, should be set aside each week to honor women and give them flowers to wear around their necks. ""This would at least be a physical ritual,"" Mr. Raney wrote, because ""in India, rituals create change."" More reader responses on this topic can be found here.

"196","Calls Grow Louder for Politician Accused of Rape to Resign","Asia","KOCHI- Demands for a fresh investigation of an Indian politician accused of raping a teenager in 1996 gained momentum after the young woman's mother urged the Congress Party's leader to dismiss the lawmaker. As a teenager, a woman from a small town called Suryanelli in Kerala was allegedly abducted and raped by 42 men over a period of 40 days in January and February of 1996. Among the suspects the girl identified was P.J. Kurien, then a member of Parliament and now the deputy chairman of the upper house of Parliament. In an emotionally charged letter to Sonia Gandhi, the president of Congress Party, the woman's mother called for Mr. Kurien, a Congress member, to be dismissed from his position in the Rajya Sabha. ""We believe that Mr. P.J. Kurien has exerted undue influence over the investigating officials in order to escape from the clutches of law, and he had succeeded in that,"" she said in the letter, dated Thursday. She also asked Mrs. Gandhi how Mr. Kurien could be allowed to preside over the legislative debate on criminal law amendments for tougher rape laws. In a country outraged by the gang-rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in Delhi and by the authorities' failure to prevent and punish crimes against women, this latest rape case is being seen as yet another example of India's slow justice system, where cases languish in courts for years. It has also focused attention on official corruption, which allows the wealthy and politically connected to influence police investigations. For the last 17 years, the Kerala rape case has been winding its way through India's judicial system. On Jan. 31, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial, overturning the acquittal of a majority of the 42 suspects in 2005 by the Kerala High Court, which said that the girl had not tried to escape. The girl alleged that Mr. Kurien had raped her at a government guest house in the southern town of Kumily. But police failed to include him on the list of men she had accused, so she filed a private complaint before a magistrate in 1999, said Sureshbabu Thomas, a special prosecutor for the case against the rest of the men. Mr. Kurien filed a petition to dismiss the case in the lower court, which rejected his request. He then filed his appeal with the Kerala High Court, which said there was insufficient evidence against Mr. Kurien. The state government of Kerala appealed to the Supreme Court, which sided with Mr. Kurien. ""All the others who were named by the victim had to appear in the court, but P.J. Kurien did not,"" K.V. Bhadra Kumari, a women's rights activist and a lawyer, said in a phone interview. ""Let him also be tried and let the law take its course."" The Kerala government has refused to investigate Mr. Kurien, saying that his case has been cleared by the Supreme Court, but that has only enraged those who want Mr. Kurien to stand trial. Opposition leaders in Kerala, Mr. Kurien's home state, disrupted state legislative assembly proceedings Friday, demanding that Mr. Kurien resign. Angry protests were also held in Kerala's capital city of Thiruvananthapuram. Mr. Kurien has refused to step down. ""I have already offered myself for judicial scrutiny in 1990s. Why should I do so again?"" Mr. Kurien told an Indian television channel NDTV. ""Then the High Court and Supreme Court had exonerated me. A fresh investigation will be contempt of court."" Kerala, one of the few states in India where women outnumber men, is considered one of India's most progressive states because of its high literacy rates: 93.91 percent overall, and a female literacy rate of 91.98 percent. It also has a much higher rate of reported rapes than the national average and has one of the highest rates of reported crimes against women among India's 28 states. K. Ajitha, a former member of the Naxal movement who now serves as a director of Anweshi, a woman's organization that fights gender-based violence, said that one of the crucial problems is that there is a well-connected criminal network in the state, which protects political leaders and influential people when they are accused of rape. ""The organized mafia traps young adolescent girls by spreading its tentacles to all fields -- the political leadership, the police, the judiciary,"" she said. ""So a rape victim rarely receives justice."" Two of Kerala's most publicized cases of sexual assault, known in the media as the ""Suryanelli"" and the ""Vithura"" after the hometowns of the victims, have been pending for years. The trial of the 45 men accused in the Vithura case, where a girl was allegedly gang raped in 1995, is still under way 18 years after the crime was first reported. The victim, now in her early 30s, has requested the courts to discontinue the trial, saying it was traumatic to relive the incidents over and over again. The Kerala High Court, however, has rejected the request.",2013,"India"
"197","Suspect in India Gang Rape Found Dead in Jail","Asia","NEW DELHI - One of the men accused in the Delhi gang rape case was found dead in his jail cell on Monday morning, a jail official said. Ram Singh, who drove the bus in which the fatal rape took place on Dec. 16, appeared to have hanged himself from a metal grille with a rope made from his clothes, a spokesman for Tihar Jail, Sunil Gupta, said in an interview. Mr. Singh was one of five men and one teenager, including his brother Mukesh, charged with rape and murder in the death of a 23-year old physiotherapy student. The case sparked widespread protests in India and a push to increase safety for women. Mr. Singh was the first of the accused to provide details of the attack to the police. His confession helped them track the four other men and the juvenile who have been arrested in the case. Mr. Singh shared a jail cell with other inmates, Mr. Gupta said, and it was unclear how he may have hanged himself without attracting their attention. ""I suspect there is foul play,"" said V.K. Anand, the lawyer representing Mr. Singh in the case. ""There were no circumstances for committing suicide. His mental state was stable, the trial was going well, he was meeting with his family. I can't understand why he would commit suicide."" ""This is a high-profile prisoner, and he was under special protection,"" Mr. Anand added. ""He was never left alone. How could this happen?""

"198","Sexual Offenses Bill to Be Altered to Pass Parliament","Asia","NEW DELHI- A bill aimed at toughening India's laws on rape and sexual violence will be altered, India's law minister said Monday, a move expected to garner wider political support in a divided Parliament. The changes are expected to address several contentious issues, including lowering of the age of sexual consent from 18 to 16, and the definitions of new offenses like stalking and voyeurism, which critics say expose the law to misuse. ""I believe it should be possible to have a law that has a broader political consensus,"" Ashwani Kumar, the law minister, said in a televised interview with NDTV. Mr. Kumar said he expects the revised bill to be presented before Parliament on Tuesday, and pass before a recess later this week. The Indian Parliament is scheduled to go on a monthlong break in four days, and until now political parties have been sharply divided about the bill, which was crafted in response to a massive public outcry after a young woman was fatally gang raped in Delhi in December. In meetings Monday morning attended by senior politicians from several parties, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and the Samajwadi Party, an ally of the governing Indian National Congress, voiced their disagreement to parts of the bill. ""This will lead to the unnecessary harassment of people,"" said Ram Gopal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party in an interview on television, referring to the sections that make stalking and voyerism illegal. ""We will have to make different schools and different roads, where men walk on one side and women on the other."" Women's rights activist Vrinda Grover said comments like these are indicative of a regressive mindset that is ""extremely uncomfortable"" when the law tries to ""criminalize conduct that amounts to sexual violence."" ""How can any man in his right mind oppose a law to punish men who watch women bathing, or going to the toilet, or indulging in a sexual act?"" she said. Demand for this bill comes from a broad range of activists, lawyers and citizens, many of whom took to the streets in December to demand justice for the 23-year-old victim of the fatal gang rape. The government, which promised swift changes in the legal system, is under immense public pressure, and no political party wants to be seen as obstructing the bill. On Feb. 3, the government hurriedly passed an ordinance that made temporary changes to Indian laws dealing with crimes against women, which was widely criticized as an act of tokenism. The ordinance is set to expire on April 4. The blueprint for these changes is a report, submitted in January by a three-person committee headed by former Chief Justice J.S. Verma, which garnered appreciation from politicians and activists for its scathing critique of the government's performance on gender rights and its far-reaching recommendations for an overhaul of the legal and judicial system. The government has since been criticized for taking a piecemeal approach to implementing the recommendations of the report. Activists see the last-minute scramble to get the bill passed as a sign of the government's attitude to issues of women's rights. ""The government should have started discussions on the bill much ahead of time,"" said Ms. Grover. When the government is determined to pass something, she said, they find a way of doing it, through a series of meetings and deals. If the bill is not passed before Parliament goes on a break, she said, ""the signal is loud and clear that our lives, our dignity, our very existence is not a priority for the government.""",2013,"India"
"199","The Unspeakable Truth About Rape in India","Asia","Sonia Faleiro is the author of ''Beautiful Thing: Inside the Secret World of Bombay's Dance Bars.''  I LIVED for 24 years in New Delhi, a city where sexual harassment is as regular as mealtime. Every day, somewhere in the city, it crosses the line into rape. As a teenager, I learned to protect myself. I never stood alone if I could help it, and I walked quickly, crossing my arms over my chest, refusing to make eye contact or smile. I cleaved through crowds shoulder-first, and avoided leaving the house after dark except in a private car. At an age when young women elsewhere were experimenting with daring new looks, I wore clothes that were two sizes too large. I still cannot dress attractively without feeling that I am endangering myself. Things didn't change when I became an adult. Pepper spray wasn't available, and my friends, all of them middle- or upper-middle-class like me, carried safety pins or other makeshift weapons to and from their universities and jobs. One carried a knife, and insisted I do the same. I refused; some days I was so full of anger I would have used it -- or, worse, had it used on me. The steady thrum of whistles, catcalls, hisses, sexual innuendos and open threats continued. Packs of men dawdled on the street, and singing Hindi film songs, rich with double entendres, was how they communicated. To make their demands clear, they would thrust their pelvises at female passers-by. If only it was just public spaces that were unsafe. In my office at a prominent newsmagazine, at the doctor's office, even at a house party -- I couldn't escape the intimidation. On Dec. 16, as the world now knows, a 23-year-old woman and a male friend were returning home after watching the movie ''Life of Pi'' at a mall in southwest Delhi. After they boarded what seemed to be a passenger bus, the six men inside gang-raped and tortured the woman so brutally that her intestines were destroyed. The bus service had been a ruse. The attackers also severely beat up the woman's friend and threw them from the vehicle, leaving her to die. The young woman didn't oblige. She had started that evening watching a film about a survivor, and must have been determined to survive herself. Then she produced another miracle. In Delhi, a city habituated to the debasement of women, tens of thousands of people took to the streets and faced down police officers, tear gas and water cannons to express their outrage. It was the most vocal protest against sexual assault and rape in India to date, and it set off nationwide demonstrations. To protect her privacy the victim's name was not released publicly. But while she remains nameless, she did not remain faceless. To see her face, women had only to look in the mirror. The full measure of their vulnerability was finally understood. When I was 26, I moved to Mumbai. A commercial and financial megalopolis, it has its own special set of problems, but has, culturally, been more cosmopolitan and liberal than Delhi. Giddy with my new freedom, I started to report from the red-light district and traveled across rough suburbs late at night -- on my own and using public transit. It seemed that something good had come out of living in Delhi: I was so grateful for the comparatively safe environment of Mumbai that I took full advantage of it. The young woman, however, will never have such an opportunity. On Saturday morning, 13 days after she was brutalized, this student of physical therapy, who had, no doubt, dreamt of improving lives, lost her own. She died of multiple organ failure. India has laws against rape; seats reserved for women in buses, female officers; special police help lines. But these measures have been ineffective in the face of a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. It is a culture that believes that the worst aspect of rape is the defilement of the victim, who will no longer be able to find a man to marry her -- and that the solution is to marry the rapist. These beliefs aren't restricted to living rooms, but are expressed openly. In the months before the gang rape, some prominent politicians had attributed rising rape statistics to women's increasing use of cellphones and going out at night. ''Just because India achieved freedom at midnight does not mean that women can venture out after dark,'' said Botsa Satyanarayana, the Congress Party leader in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Change is possible, but the police must document reports of rape and sexual assault, and investigations and court cases have to be fast-tracked and not left to linger for years. Of the more than 600 rape cases reported in Delhi in 2012, only one led to a conviction. If victims believe they will receive justice, they will be more willing to speak up. If potential rapists fear the consequences of their actions, they will not pluck women off the streets with impunity. The volume of protests in public and in the media has made clear that the attack was a turning point. The unspeakable truth is that the young woman attacked on Dec. 16 was more fortunate than many rape victims. She was among the very few to receive anything close to justice. She was hospitalized, her statement was recorded and within days all six of the suspected rapists were caught and, now, charged with murder. Such efficiency is unheard-of in India. In retrospect it wasn't the brutality of the attack on the young woman that made her tragedy unusual; it was that an attack had, at last, elicited a response.",2013,"India"
"200","Confronting Rape in India, and Around the World","Asia","To the Editor: Re ''The Unspeakable Truth About Rape in India,'' by Sonia Faleiro (Op-Ed, Jan. 2): Finally, women are speaking out. The highly publicized violent acts of rape against two young Indian women in the last two weeks have drawn the sympathy and attention of the world. That the police suggested marriage to one of the rapists as the solution rather than prison for the perpetrators is simply outrageous. Obviously, measures need to be taken to protect women and to prosecute such crimes, but even more important is a re-education program directed toward men. No doubt that will entail a searing discussion of the culture that has allowed such crimes to persist. This is the moment to begin. The deaths of these young women should not be in vain or forgotten. CAROL DELANEY Providence, R.I., Jan. 2, 2013 The writer is emerita professor of cultural anthropology at Stanford University. To the Editor: ''The Unspeakable Truth About Rape in India'' and your Dec. 29 editorial ''Rape in the World's Largest Democracy'' miss a key point. While both are correct to note that India has terribly high rates of sexual assault and other forms of violence against women, they do not mention the fact that violence is a global epidemic, not solely a byproduct of Indian culture. Our similarly high rates of sexual assault and other forms of gender-based violence in American culture seem to be accepted by a collective shrug and a ''blame the victim'' mentality. We could learn from the Indian response to the recent horrific death of a young medical student: collective action and demands for change. American and Indian women deserve better.

"201","Charges Filed Against 5 Over Rape In New Delhi","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Rape, murder and other charges were filed on Thursday against five men suspected of carrying out the gang rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student who later died of her injuries in a case that has prompted outrage and protests across India. A court official announced that beyond rape and murder, the charges include destruction of evidence and the attempted murder of the woman's companion, a list of crimes that could result in the rare imposition of the death penalty. A court official said the charges would be made public on Saturday. A sixth suspect is a juvenile, and his case will be handled separately for now. The case against the five men will be referred almost immediately to a new fast-track court set up in recent days to handle cases involving crimes against women, officials said. That court is expected to hold a trial soon in stark contrast to the apathy and years of delay that Indian rape victims often face when seeking justice. The five are accused of luring the woman and her friend onto a bus in South Delhi, beating them and abusing her so brutally with a metal rod during the rape that she sustained fatal internal injuries. The woman clung to life for two weeks but died Saturday in a Singapore hospital, where she had been transferred for special care. Gang rapes have become common in India, a country that some surveys suggest has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world. Rape complaints increased 25 percent between 2006 and 2011, although it is impossible to know whether this represents a real increase in crime or simply an increased willingness by victims to file charges and by the police to accept them. But something about the recent crime caught the public's attention. Among the reasons could be the randomness of the crime (most rape victims know their abusers), its brutality and the sympathetic profile of the victim. The outpouring of anger at the crime caught the government by surprise, and there has been widespread criticism of its aggressive response to protesters, which included tear gas, water cannons and beatings by truncheon-wielding riot police officers. The government invoked a terrorism law that prohibits even small gatherings, and it closed a huge portion of the capital to vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The government's reaction fed longtime criticism that India's police are too often used to guard the powerful from the people rather than to protect the people from predators. India's police are generally poorly trained, deeply corrupt and often viewed by women as predators rather than protectors. The case has also led to a continuing discussion about the conflict between the aspirations of India's rising middle class and a deeply conservative and patriarchal culture that views the recent educational and economic successes of Indian women with unease and even alarm. Kishwar Desai, an author, wrote an opinion article in The Indian Express on Thursday that said the gang rape illustrated to some that ''a certain class of men is deeply uncomfortable with women displaying their independence, receiving education and joining the work force. The gang rape becomes a form of subduing the women, collectively, and establishing their male superiority.'' Because of the intense interest prompted by the case, a crowd of television cameras and reporters jostled inside and outside of the courthouse for much of Thursday. And with officials refusing to provide routine information about whether the suspects would arrive at the courthouse, rumors about the day's events ricocheted around the media scrum like a drop of water on a hot frying pan.",2013,"India"
"202","Is Delhi So Different From Steubenville?","Asia","IN India, a 23-year-old student takes a bus home from a movie and is gang-raped and assaulted so viciously that she dies two weeks later. In Liberia, in West Africa, an aid group called More Than Me rescues a 10-year-old orphan who has been trading oral sex for clean water to survive. In Steubenville, Ohio, high school football players are accused of repeatedly raping an unconscious 16-year-old girl who was either drunk or rendered helpless by a date-rape drug and was apparently lugged like a sack of potatoes from party to party. And in Washington, our members of Congress show their concern for sexual violence by failing to renew the Violence Against Women Act, a landmark law first passed in 1994 that has now expired. Gender violence is one of the world's most common human rights abuses. Women worldwide ages 15 through 44 are more likely to die or be maimed because of male violence than because of cancer, malaria, war and traffic accidents combined. The World Health Organization has found that domestic and sexual violence affects 30 to 60 percent of women in most countries. In some places, rape is endemic: in South Africa, a survey found that 37 percent of men reported that they had raped a woman. In others, rape is institutionalized as sex trafficking. Everywhere, rape often puts the victim on trial: in one poll, 68 percent of Indian judges said that ''provocative attire'' amounts to ''an invitation to rape.'' Americans watched the events after the Delhi gang rape with a whiff of condescension at the barbarity there, but domestic violence and sex trafficking remain a vast problem across the United States. One obstacle is that violence against women tends to be invisible and thus not a priority. In Delhi, of 635 rape cases reported in the first 11 months of last year, only one ended in conviction. That creates an incentive for rapists to continue to rape, but in any case that reported number of rapes is delusional. They don't include the systematized rape of sex trafficking. India has, by my reckoning, more women and girls trafficked into modern slavery than any country in the world. (China has more prostitutes, but they are more likely to sell sex by choice.) On my last trip to India, I tagged along on a raid on a brothel in Kolkata, organized by the International Justice Mission. In my column at the time, I focused on a 15-year-old and a 10-year-old imprisoned in the brothel, and mentioned a 17-year-old only in passing because I didn't know her story. My assistant at The Times, Natalie Kitroeff, recently visited India and tracked down that young woman. It turns out that she had been trafficked as well -- she was apparently drugged at a teahouse and woke up in the brothel. She said she was then forced to have sex with customers and beaten when she protested. She was never allowed outside and was never paid. What do you call what happened to those girls but slavery? Yet prosecutors and the police often shrug -- or worse. Dr. Shershah Syed, a former president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Pakistan, once told me: ''When I treat a rape victim, I always advise her not to go to the police. Because if she does, the police might just rape her again.'' In the United States, the case in Steubenville has become controversial partly because of the brutishness that the young men have been accused of, but also because of concerns that the authorities protected the football team. Some people in both Delhi and Steubenville rushed to blame the victim, suggesting that she was at fault for taking a bus or going to a party. They need to think: What if that were me? The United States could help change the way the world confronts these issues. On a remote crossing of the Nepal-India border, I once met an Indian police officer who said, a bit forlornly, that he was stationed there to look for terrorists and pirated movies. He wasn't finding any, but India posted him there to show that it was serious about American concerns regarding terrorism and intellectual property. Meanwhile, that officer ignored the steady flow of teenage Nepali girls crossing in front of him on their way to Indian brothels, because modern slavery was not perceived as an American priority. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has done a superb job trying to put these issues on the global agenda, and I hope President Obama and Senator John Kerry will continue her efforts. But Congress has been pathetic. Not only did it fail to renew the Violence Against Women Act, but it has also stalled on the global version, the International Violence Against Women Act, which would name and shame foreign countries that tolerate gender violence. Congress even failed to renew the landmark legislation against human trafficking, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The obstacles were different in each case, but involved political polarization and paralysis. Can members of Congress not muster a stand on modern slavery? (Hmm. I now understand better the results of a new survey from Public Policy Polling showing that Congress, with 9 percent approval, is less popular than cockroaches, traffic jams, lice or Genghis Khan.) Skeptics fret that sexual violence is ingrained into us, making the problem hopeless. But just look at modern American history, for the rising status of women has led to substantial drops in rates of reported rape and domestic violence. Few people realize it, but Justice Department statistics suggest that the incidence of rape has fallen by three-quarters over the last four decades. Likewise, the rate at which American women are assaulted by their domestic partners has fallen by more than half in the last two decades. That reflects a revolution in attitudes. Steven Pinker, in his book ''The Better Angels of Our Nature,'' notes that only half of Americans polled in 1987 said that it was always wrong for a man to beat his wife with a belt or a stick; a decade later, 86 percent said it was always wrong. But the progress worldwide is far too slow. Let's hope that India makes such violence a national priority. And maybe the rest of the world, especially our backward Congress, will appreciate that the problem isn't just India's but also our own.",2013,"India"
"203","For Rape Victims in India, Police Are Often Part of the Problem","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Not long after telling the police that she had been raped, a woman from South Delhi looked out her apartment window and saw the man who had attacked her laughing with an officer who had given him a ride back from the police station. ''That officer then came over and asked me why I wanted to file a complaint,'' the 30-year-old mother of two said in a recent interview. ''He said I would be ridiculed unless I agreed to settle things without an investigation.'' After months of intimidation from her rapist and indifference from the police, she got a politically powerful acquaintance to intervene, and her rapist was finally arrested. A court case is under way. A far more prominent case, the brutal gang rape on a bus in New Delhi last month, and the later death of the victim, has led to an anguished re-examination in India of many of the nation's age-old attitudes toward violence against women. But even as India grapples with the polarizing issue, a powerful force stands in the way of any fundamental change: a police force that is corrupt, easily susceptible to political interference, heavily male and woefully understaffed. ''If you're a woman in distress, the last thing you want to do is go to the police,'' said Vrinda Grover, a human rights lawyer based in New Delhi. In many rape cases, the police spend more time seeking reconciliation between the attacker and the victim than investigating the facts. Over all, experts say, the police are poorly organized to deal with serious crimes, particularly those against women. Pay is poor and opportunities for advancement are rare, leaving many police officers dependent on bribes to support their families. People without money or political connections are often ignored. In the latest official move to deter further such attacks, the Delhi police announced late last week that constables would be stationed nightly at 300 bus stops around the city. The problem with this plan is that many women say the presence of police officers makes them feel less safe, not more. The treatment of women by the police is such a concern that laws now forbid officers to arrest or even bring women in for questioning during nighttime hours. In case after case, the police have used their powers to deliver abused women into the hands of their abusers. Police reforms have been proposed for decades, but few have been put in place, because many of them involve making officers less susceptible to political meddling -- something politicians have little incentive to seek. Of all the problems affecting the police, many women's advocates point to cultural tradition as the most intractable. Even as India has undergone an economic upheaval that has brought millions of women out of the home and into urban workplaces, a profound attachment to female sexual virtue remains deeply embedded in the Indian psyche. The foundational texts of Indian culture -- the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, ancient Sanskrit epics -- both revolve around the communal outrage that results from insults to a good woman's modesty. ''A woman's body as the site of cultural purity is the predominant theme in the epics,'' said Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of international studies at Brown University. ''And dishonoring a woman is equal to dishonoring a family and even a culture.'' As a result, the police and village elders often see their first duty after a rape as protecting a woman's modesty and a family's honor, instead of giving her justice. On Dec. 26, an 18-year-old Punjabi woman committed suicide after police officers refused for five weeks to arrest the men who were suspected of gang raping her and instead pressed her to marry one of the men. So many Indian women end up marrying their rapists that the police often squander the first hours and days after a woman reports a rape seeking just such a resolution, said Ravi Kant, president of Shakti Vahini, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''That first crucial day is almost always lost,'' he said. Delays are endemic and courts are backlogged. Of the more than 600 rapes reported in New Delhi last year -- far below the actual number of such attacks, experts say -- only one person has been convicted so far. In a vicious circle, police ineffectiveness leads many women to consent to marriage, but such marriages, sometimes reached after the police have gone to the effort to pursue a case, discourage adequate police investigations. Suman Nalwa, a deputy commissioner in Delhi's police force, said that changing the mind-set of the constables, many of them from small villages outside of New Delhi, ''is a tough process. You cannot do it at the snap of a finger.'' At the same time, Indian police officers are few and poorly paid, and that makes them easily susceptible to corruption. India has just 1,585,117 officers to protect 1.2 billion people, or about 130 officers per 100,000 people, the second lowest among 50 countries ranked by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Only Uganda fared worse; many nations have more than twice India's ratio of police officers to population. More than 80 percent of India's police officers are constables who cannot investigate crimes or issue fines; most are assigned to paramilitary forces that do little traditional police work. Just 5 percent of police officers are women, though the government recently announced it would hire more female officers in Delhi. ''That the Indian police are performing poorly is beyond doubt,'' said Arvind Verma, a professor of criminal justice at Indiana University, an expert on the Indian police and a consultant to the government. ''The common experience is that the personnel are rude, indifferent, abusive, threatening and extortionist.'' An impermeable police hierarchy is another problem. Top leaders are taken from the Indian Police Service, an elite core of bureaucrats who never serve in front-line positions. It is all but impossible for a beat cop to rise to the top, making for a wide disconnect between police officers and their leaders. Salaries are abysmal, about $100 per month for constables. Police stations often lack toilets and heat. Many low-level officers pay recruitment bribes of a year's salary to get their jobs, so demanding payments on everything from routine traffic violations to major crimes becomes a way of life. Such behavior saps public trust, worsening security. ''It is an unfortunate reality that police are not trusted in this country,'' said Nirmal K. Singh, a former joint director of the Central Bureau of Investigation. Another important reason for that lack of trust is frequent political interference. Officers have few civil service protections, and politicians can transfer or punish police leaders at will. Conspiracies between the police and politicians are common. Hundreds of people have been killed in police shootings with political overtones, and blatantly political arrests occur frequently. Two women living near Mumbai were arrested recently for a Facebook post that politely questioned the deference given a deceased political leader. A professor in Kolkata was arrested after forwarding a political cartoon by e-mail, and a farmer in West Bengal was arrested after he asked a tough question of the state's chief minister at a political rally. For the woman in South Delhi who said the police had refused to take her rape complaint seriously, politicization of the police means justice is available only to the well connected. When her rapist threatened her 12-year-old daughter, she turned to her brother to call a high-ranking politician. Belatedly, the police sprang into action. Asked about the case, a police supervisor said he would check on details, but had not responded further by Tuesday. ''During that whole time, I lived in fear of my husband being killed or my kids being kidnapped, because I knew the police wouldn't help if that happened,'' the woman said. ''I have no faith in the police. If you have money or connections, you can get justice. If you don't, forget it.''",2013,"India"
"204","Trial in Rape Defies Delays That Torment India's Courts","Asia","NEW DELHI -- For Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful politician, the 23-year-old victim of the fatal gang rape last month ''embodied the spirit of an aspirational India.'' ''We will ensure,'' Ms. Gandhi pledged in a nationally broadcast speech on Sunday, ''that she will not have died in vain.'' Ms. Gandhi's vow sums up the challenges facing the Indian judicial system. In a South Delhi courtroom on Thursday, arguments are scheduled to begin in a trial for five men accused in the rape, which galvanized the nation and captured the attention of the world. The trial will take place in a ''fast track'' court for crimes against women that was set up in response to public furor over the assault. But whether the trial can treat the defendants fairly and provide justice for the victim and her family while laying the groundwork for sweeping changes in India's judiciary system remains very much an open question. The police say that the rape was a premeditated and vicious attack in which the five men and a teenager, who is being tried separately, raped the victim one by one and then tried to kill her and destroy evidence to cover up the crime. The men are charged with robbery, gang rape and murder, and could be sentenced to death by hanging if found guilty. All five will plead not guilty, their lawyers said. The news media and outsiders have been barred from the courtroom and from reporting on the day-to-day proceedings, which is common in rape trials in India. Rare in its reported savagery, the Dec. 16 rape on a moving bus in South Delhi propelled thousands of Indians into the streets to protest. They were outraged over not only the attack but also what many women describe as a pattern of harassment, assault and ill treatment that keeps them bound to a second-tier citizenship even as many increasingly educated and urbanized women are advancing in the workplace. It is a country, they note, where Ms. Gandhi is president of the governing Congress Party, yet hundreds of millions of other women are still trapped in a web of traditional strictures. The government, by some measures, has responded forcefully. The rape ''has left an indelible mark and shaken the conscience of the nation,'' wrote India's chief justice, Altamas Kabir, who in early January called for more fast-track courts similar to South Delhi's. These cases need to be dealt with ''expeditiously,'' he wrote, to curb what he described as a ''sharp increase'' in violence against women. Already, several states have established such courts, and many others are expected to follow suit. Even though the police are often reluctant to investigate rape and sexual assault allegations, the courts are badly backed up. More than 95,000 rape cases were awaiting trial in India at the beginning of 2011, according to government figures, but just 16 percent of them were resolved by the end of the year. Of the cases that go to trial, about 26 percent yield a conviction, half the rate in the United States or Britain. Women's rights activists say the process often yields more trauma for the victim than punishment for the guilty. In one extreme example, legal proceedings against dozens of men charged with the rape of a teenage girl in Kerala in 1995 are still under way. In August 2011, the victim, now in her 30s, asked that the proceedings be stopped, saying she could not bear to relive the crime yet again. The Kerala High Court refused, and the victim is expected to appear in court as a witness in February. But creating a fast-track system to deal with rape cases like the fatal assault in Delhi highlights the shortcomings of the entire Indian judicial system, critics say, and may even add to the problem. ''Grotesque as this case has been,'' said Rebecca John, a New Delhi criminal lawyer with 25 years of experience, ''there have been many other grotesque examples.'' By creating five fast-track courts for crimes against women, and pulling in judges to preside in them, the government has only increased the burden on other courts, she said. If included in a United Nations study of 2008 data from 65 nations, India's ratio of 14 judges per million people would have been the fourth-lowest, besting only Guatemala, Nicaragua and Kenya. ''The Indian judicial system tends to work pretty well, when the process is set in motion,'' said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director for Human Rights Watch. ''The flaws lie in the delays'' in getting cases heard, she said. On Wednesday, a panel of legal experts formed in response to the protests over the New Delhi rape submitted a 650-page report suggesting, among other things, that stalking and voyeurism be punished by jail terms. Still, the report said poor governance, not poor legislation, was responsible for the shoddy justice delivered to women in India. Adding more judges in India is a difficult and haphazard process, handled individually by states. ''There are various issues that lead to posts of judges not being filled, ranging from budgetary constraints, to the lack of qualified candidates, to just apathy,'' said Mrinal Satish, an associate professor at the National Law University in New Delhi. While some see the Delhi trial as a model for handling crimes against women, it is different in many ways from most cases, lawyers and women's activists said. Unusually, there is a witness to the attack. The woman's companion, 29, told the police what he remembered, but he was unconscious for some of the assault after being beaten with a metal rod that was also used against the woman, who died in a Singapore hospital from her injuries. Second, the police acted quickly after the attack was reported, in part because of the media attention. They collected DNA evidence linking the five defendants to the attack, the prosecutor in the case said, including blood and semen found on their clothing, on the victim and in the bus. The attack was also particularly brutal. Bite marks were discovered all over the woman, according to a court document. She was tortured with an iron rod inserted into her vagina and rectum. At one point, according to the police, one of the suspects pulled out some of her internal organs. The trial will pit an eclectic group of defense lawyers, one of whom has courted controversy by alleging publicly that the rape was the victim's fault, against one of Delhi's most trusted public prosecutors, who also happens to be one of the most overworked. Rajiv Mohan, the prosecutor, is handling about 150 cases, he said in an interview. He often juggles six or seven a day, he said. Defenses mounted by the five accused will vary, their lawyers and others involved with the trial said. Two of the men, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma, have offered to turn state's witness, the police said. A. P. Singh, a lawyer who represents Mr. Sharma and another defendant, Akshay Thakur, said Mr. Sharma was not on the bus when the attack occurred. M. L. Sharma, a lawyer who has publicly stated that ''respectable'' women do not get raped, is petitioning the Supreme Court to move the case out of Delhi, arguing that his single-named client, Mukesh, will not get a fair trial because of the intense publicity. Veteran lawyers say the judge, Yogesh Khanna, is considered balanced and is known for trying to avoid unnecessary delays. He will be tested. The rowdy, sometimes violent protests that shook Delhi included angry knots of citizens demanding hangings, even before the victim died. A hurried trial, followed by a knee-jerk death penalty verdict, would be a mistake, many say.",2013,"India"
"205","India: President Warns of 'Moral' Crisis","Asia","NEW DELHI -- President Pranab Mukherjee on Friday warned about the danger of corruption corroding Indian public life and called on the country to ''reset its moral compass'' in light of a grisly gang rape and murder of a young woman that have stirred outrage and protests in India and around the world. Mr. Mukherjee, speaking in a nationally televised address on the eve of Republic Day, the national holiday observing the enactment of India's democratic constitution, made a blunt call for gender equity and described the Dec. 16 attack on the young woman in New Delhi as a ''grave tragedy that has shattered complacency.'' ''The brutal rape and murder of a young woman, a woman who was a symbol of all that new India strives to be, has left our hearts empty and our minds in turmoil,'' Mr. Mukherjee said. ''We lost more than a valuable life; we lost a dream. If today young Indians feel outraged, can we blame our youth?'' The position of president is largely ceremonial in India's parliamentary democracy. But Mr. Mukherjee, who became president last year, is one of India's most experienced and respected political figures. On Friday, he used what is often a bland and celebratory address to deliver a plaintive message to the nation. ''When we brutalize a woman, we wound the soul of our civilization,'' he said, noting the sanctity of a woman in India's Hindu religious traditions. ''It is time for the nation to reset its moral compass. Nothing should be allowed to spur cynicism, as cynicism is blind to morality. We must look deep into our conscience and find out where we have faltered.'' Mr. Mukherjee's remarks came as the rape and its aftermath continued to shake India. On Wednesday, a special government commission led by a former chief justice of the Indian Supreme Court released a report calling for major reforms in policing as well as legislation to expand criminal penalties for some crimes against women. Meanwhile, on Thursday, a judge presiding over a special ''fast track'' court in New Delhi began hearing the trial of five defendants in the rape case. The case could last for several months, with a huge list of witnesses, though the judge has invoked a gag order that has tightly restricted what information can be made public about the proceedings. The case has resonated, not only because of the grisly brutality of the attack, but also because of the clumsy and, in some cases, insensitive response of India's political class. The police were initially called in to beat back protesters, many of them college students. Several politicians and spiritual leaders were quoted making insensitive comments about the case. More recently, political parties have sought to tap into the anger unleashed by the attack -- often with unorthodox solutions. In Mumbai, the country's financial capital, a right-wing Hindu nationalist party, the Shiv Sena, has distributed kitchen knives and chili powder to women, even as they described it as a symbolic gesture. In his address, Mr. Mukherjee spoke about how the rape case had tapped into the disillusionment of India's younger generation, one that had already been expressing disenchantment with the country's political system. This group, often described as India's ''demographic dividend,'' is struggling to find quality jobs, quality education and opportunity in India's economy. ''The future belongs to them,'' Mr. Mukherjee said. ''They are today troubled by a range of existential doubts. Does the system offer due reward for merit? Has corruption overtaken morality in public life? Does our legislature reflect emerging India or does it need radical reforms? These doubts have to be set at rest. Elected representatives must win back the confidence of the people.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",2013,"India"
"206","Chinese Party and Business Officials Fired in Sex Scandal","Asia","BEIJING -- The young women met the officials for illicit trysts with video cameras hidden in their purses. Every detail of the encounters was recorded. Then a group of men confronted the officials with the video recordings and made demands. China's state news media reported on Friday details of a sex extortion ring that brazenly operated ''honey traps'' in the southwest metropolis of Chongqing for several years. The widening scandal, which first emerged late last year, has led to the dismissals of at least 11 officials of the Communist Party, the government or state-owned companies for having sex with women from the ring and then being blackmailed by the men who had set up the snares. Xi Jinping, China's new top leader, has vowed to root out official corruption and said this week that ''flies,'' or relatively low-level bureaucrats, as well as top officials he referred to as ''tigers,'' must be brought down. The most famous victim of the sex ring scandal is Lei Zhengfu, a middle-aged district party chief who was secretly filmed having sex in a hotel room in 2008 with a young woman. In late November 2012, the leaked video of Mr. Lei began circulating on the Internet, and he became the poster boy for a series of low-level or midlevel officials who had been brought down by scandals, often sexual in nature, across the nation. Mr. Lei was removed from his job and placed under investigation soon after the video appeared online. Now, according to Xinhua, the state news agency, 10 other officials have been removed as well for falling prey to the sex ring. Five of them were executives in state-owned companies. The sex scandal might have come out earlier, but Bo Xilai, the Chongqing party chief at the time, and Wang Lijun, his police chief, buried the results of an investigation into the ring, according to news reports. Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang were both felled last year by the fallout from the murder of a British business executive that the party said was arranged by Mr. Bo's wife; Mr. Bo is expected to be tried soon on a wide range of criminal charges. While the two scandals are unrelated, the airing of the blackmail ring at this time could reflect a decision by the Chinese leadership to highlight other problems in Chongqing under Mr. Bo's rule. The ring's mastermind was a man named Xiao Ye, according to a report by Southern Metropolis Daily on Wednesday that was cited by Xinhua in its Friday article. Three women were used as bait. The state media reports did not say exactly what the officials gave the men in return for keeping the officials' involvement secret, but one report said that a company run by Mr. Xiao was involved in a real estate development project in the district that was governed by Mr. Lei. Mr. Xiao gave the women a list of Chongqing officials whom the women were to contact, Xinhua reported. The women sent text messages, telling the officials that they worked for a local real estate company and had met the official at a banquet. ''Hope we can stay in touch a lot,'' they wrote. If the officials said they had no memory of the meeting, the women would invoke the name of a chief executive and pretend to be angry that the official had forgotten the woman already. If the official bit, the woman would continue flirting by text or transmit seductive photos of herself, Xinhua said. A woman would then meet with the official in an upscale hotel to have tea, coffee or a snack. The official would hand her gifts, like jewelry. At a later rendezvous, when the two were ready to have sex, the woman would make sure to show up at the hotel room with a hidden camera. This happened over and over until the video was clear enough, Xinhua reported. Then, at a later tryst, several men in the ring would show up while the official and the woman were in the middle of having sex. One of the men would pretend to be the woman's boyfriend and throw a fit. Behind him would be another man pretending to be a private detective. A third man would then show up and say he was a member of a gang. They would beat up the official and show him the video. Mr. Xiao entered the scene afterward to work out an agreement with the official and assure him that the video would remain buried, as long as the demands were met. The police first investigated the ring in 2008, after Mr. Lei, fearing the videos would eventually leak out anyway, told senior officials about the ring, the news reports said. But the results were buried or ignored by Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang.",2013,"China"
"207","Notorious Attack Spurs India To Approve New Rape Laws","Asia","NEW DELHI -- India's government on Sunday approved tough new laws to deter sexual violence against women, including the death penalty in certain rape cases, as leaders moved to respond to public outrage over a recent gang rape case in the national capital. The new package of laws, signed on Sunday by President Pranab Mukherjee after earlier approval by the cabinet, amends India's penal code and, for the first time, will apply the death penalty to rape cases in which the victim dies. The new measures also made crimes such as voyeurism, stalking, acid attacks and the trafficking of women as punishable under criminal law. India's coalition national government has been criticized for its clumsy handling of the protests that erupted after the brutal Dec. 16 gang rape of a young woman, who later died. The new ordinance takes effect immediately, though it must be approved by India's Parliament within six months. Reaction has been mixed. Even as some legal advocates praised the changes as overdue, leaders of different women's groups on Saturday held a news conference appealing to the president not to sign the measure, which they considered incomplete. ''This is a piecemeal and fragmented ordinance, which seems to be more of an exercise to make an impact,'' said Kirti Singh, a lawyer who specializes in women's issues. ''After 20 years of not doing anything, they seem to be in a tremendous hurry to do something or the other to appease public sentiment.'' Last month, a special three-member committee led by a former Supreme Court chief justice, J. S. Verma, completed a far-reaching report that urged the government to act on a broad range of measures, including changes to criminal penalties, but also placing an emphasis on education and a holistic solution. While the new measures followed some of the recommendations by the Verma committee, others were ignored, including the panel's call for criminal penalties in cases of marital rape, as well as the prosecution of military personnel who commit sexual assaults. In addition, the Verma committee pointedly rejected the death penalty in cases of rape. India's cabinet approved the new measures on Friday, as leaders spoke about their desire to send a signal to the public after the New Delhi rape case. Included in the changes were provisions to improve police investigations of sex crimes, such as requiring the presence of female officers to help interview rape victims. The new provisions include varying degrees of punishment, ranging from a minimum of seven years in prison to the death penalty, in those cases where the victim dies or is left in a vegetative state. Many advocates, while welcoming some of the changes, objected to the introduction of the death penalty. ''Every country is moving toward the elimination of death penalty, and India is strengthening the legislation for the death penalty,'' said Kavita Srivastava, the national secretary for the People's Union for Civil Liberties. ''Here we are still looking for an eye for an eye framework.''",2013,"India"
"208","Indian Government Faulted on Child Sexual Abuse","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Sexual abuse of children is ''disturbingly common'' in India, and the government's response to it has fallen short, both in protecting children and in treating victims, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday. The group urged the government to better shield children from sexual abuse as part of a broad push for change after the death of a young woman who was gang-raped here in December. Although there are child protection laws on the books, including one passed last year, the rights organization said the measures were not properly enforced. ''Children are sexually abused by relatives at home, by people in their neighborhoods, at school and in residential facilities for orphans and other at-risk children,'' said the 82-page report, titled ''Breaking the Silence: Child Sexual Abuse in India.'' Yet most cases go unreported. A 2007 government-sponsored study, based on interviews with 12,500 children in 13 Indian states, said that 53 percent of the children reported having been sexually abused in some way, but only 3 percent of the cases were reported to the police. ''Children who bravely complain of sexual abuse are often dismissed or ignored by the police, medical staff and other authorities,'' Meenakshi Ganguly, the director of Human Rights Watch in South Asia, said in a statement. In response, the government acknowledged flaws in its child protection system, with the head of one government agency saying at a news briefing that in many cases the police or court officials did not accept that rape or incest had occurred. ''People have to be made aware of their rights, the procedures to be followed in registering a case in a police station, and insist that they get justice,'' said Shantha Sinha, the chairwoman of the agency, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, The Associated Press reported. In interviews with more than 100 people, Human Rights Watch found that the police, government officials and doctors were unprepared to deal with child sexual abuse cases and often made the situation worse by not believing the children's accounts and subjecting them to humiliating medical examinations. The rights group reported that in four cases, doctors used an unscientific ''finger test'' to examine girls who had been raped. ''The process is so traumatic that in some cases the children are better off not reporting'' abuse, Ms. Ganguly said in an interview. Sexual abuse of children happens everywhere, Ms. Ganguly said, but in India the official response to it seriously compounds the problem. In one episode, a 12-year-old girl who reported to the police that she had been raped by a man from a politically connected family was locked in jail for almost two weeks, the report found. The police insisted that she change her story, it said. Activists called for more comprehensive reforms, arguing that the laws and the support system for children should be better integrated. ''It has to be holistic,'' Hasina Kharbhih, a child rights activist, said in an interview. Child sexual abuse, she said, ''has devastating aftereffects which haunt the victims as they grow into adulthood.'' She added that the enormity of such crimes was often not acknowledged in India. One particular focus of the report is the sexual abuse of orphans and other at-risk children at residential care facilities. The rights group said that facilities in most parts of the country were not inspected often enough, and that many privately run ones were not even registered. ''As a result, the government has neither a record of all the orphanages and other institutions operating in the country nor a list of the children they are housing,'' the report said. ''Abuse occurs even in supposedly well-run and respected institutions because of poor monitoring.'' India has signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child, an international treaty that protects children. The rights group noted that doing so obliged all levels of government to not only take steps to protect children against sexual abuse but to also offer a remedy when protections are violated.",2013,"India"
"209","Disbelief in Bihar Village of Man Accused in the Delhi Rape Case","Asia","AURANGABAD, Bihar - The family of Akshay Thakur, one of the six accused in the Delhi gang rape case, first learned about the incident and the nationwide protests it has inspired when local police officers came to their house looking for him. The family owns a television set, but cannot watch it because there is no electricity in the area. Newspapers don't reach this far. Their village of Lahangkarma is in the northeastern state of Bihar, on the remote, dusty plains that straddle the border with Jharkhand state. An anti-government insurgency movement, known as Maoists, is active in the area, and attacked the local police station in December 2011. Family members said they can't believe that Mr. Thakur, 24, a high school dropout, could have committed the crime. He has admitted to both family and the police that on Dec. 16 he was on the bus where a young woman was gang-raped and fatally beaten, but has not confessed to anything more to them. Police identified him Dec. 18 as the ""helper"" of Ram Singh, the bus driver. ""He loves me very much and I'll not believe anyone that he is involved in such a dirty thing,"" his wife, Punita Devi, said in an interview in the village. Ms. Devi, who married Mr. Thakur in 2010, held their crying year-and-a-half-old son in her arms as she spoke. She did not say how old she was, but appeared younger than the marriageable age of 18. ""We were loving to each other,"" she said. ""He used to talk to me on the phone whenever he left"" the village, she added. Looking distraught and anxious, she spoke loudly and nervously, insisting on his innocence. In the aftermath of the Delhi rape, debate is raging in India about what might have prompted a group of men to commit such a violent crime against a young woman. The woman, a 23-year old physiotherapy student, was raped several times and attacked with an iron rod, injuring her internal organs so severely that portions of her intestines had to be removed. India, and particularly north India, has seen a rise in reported gang rapes in recent months, adding fuel to the debate. On Sunday, Raj Thackery, head of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, a right-wing political party, blamed the crime on migrants from Bihar. ""All are talking about the Delhi gang-rape, but no one is asking who did this. Nobody's asking from where these men came,"" he said, according to The Hindu newspaper. ""Nobody is mentioning the fact that all these rapists are from Bihar,"" he said. The Bihar police say they are unaware that any of the other men accused in the Delhi rape are from the state. The hometowns of most of the rest of the men have not been made public by the police. Five of the men accused in case, including Mr. Thakur, have been charged with murder, attempted murder, gang rape and robbery. They have also been charged under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, which holds each accused individual equally liable for all criminal acts committed together as a group. According to the police, Mr. Thakur fled Delhi after the rape, traveling first to Jaipur, then making his way by train to his home village. His father, Saryug Singh, a farmer, said he turned his son over to the police. (The surname Singh is often rendered as Thakur is Delhi.) ""I personally handed Akshay over to the police and told them if he is guilty he must be punished,"" Mr. Singh said, while wiping tears from his eyes. ""What more could I do? I don't know what will happen and I'm not capable of doing anything more."" Ms. Devi said she knew that her husband was working as a bus conductor in Delhi. ""He had told me over phone he was working on a bus in Delhi for the last two months,"" she said. Mr. Thakur had last visited his village six months ago, she said, before returning on Dec. 21. ""When he came here he told me that such an incident had happened and, though he was there in the bus along with others, he had not done anything wrong,"" she said. There is little sign of economic development in the village, and many of its young men migrate to cities, mostly to Delhi, to earn their living. Mr. Thakur had followed his two elder brothers, Vinay Singh and Abhay Singh, who both work in a private company in Gurgaon, the outsourcing mega-city south of Delhi. After he came to Delhi, he lost touch with his family, they said. Earlier, Akshay was working at a local liquor factory in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, ""but after he went to Delhi he was not in touch with us,"" said his brother Abhay Singh, who has been in the village on vacation since Dec. 15. Rejecting Mr. Singh's claim he had turned his son in, the local police said they used Mr. Thakur's mobile phone to track him down. ""The moment he came to the village, we arrested him and handed him over to the Delhi police,"" said Ajay Kumar, chief of the local Tandwa police station. The Bihar state government has announced a reward for all the police officers involved in apprehending Mr. Thakur. Along with Mr. Kumar, two other police officials, Brajesh Kumar Singh and Yatvendra Kumar Singh, are on the list of rewardees. The elder Mr. Singh said that his youngest son had no interest in education and dropped out of Pipadi High School in nearby Tandwa in the 10th grade. The police said he has no criminal record in the village. ""He was never accused in a single case here,"" said Mr. Kumar. The village chowkidar, or watchman, Ram Lakhan Paswan, said the family enjoyed a ""good reputation"" in the area. The entire family now lives cocooned inside its house, following local protests demanding harsh punishment for Mr. Thakur for having given the village, district and state a bad name. Malti Devi, Mr. Thakur's mother, guesses that he might have fallen into bad company in Delhi. ""But, he could not commit such a heinous crime"", she said, tears falling down her cheeks. ""It would have been better if I had died before seeing all this.""",2013,"India"
"210","India's Police Force Lags Much of the World","Asia","A recent spate of violent crimes against women in northern India has led to increased scrutiny of the Indian police force. In Delhi, after the gang rape and subsequent death of a young woman, residents called for the resignation of the city's chief of police and the retraining of the overwhelmingly male police force. But perhaps the question that should be asked about India's police officers is whether there are enough of them in the first place. On the basis of police per capita, India is the second lowest among 50 countries ranked using data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime from 2010. Police forces around the world are commonly measured as the number of police per 100,000 people, and India has 129. Only Uganda fares worse. While this ratio has increased significantly in India over the last decade, it remains far behind many other major economies. (The worldwide average is closer to 350). Scotland, for example, has around 330 officers per 100,000; South Africa had 327, the United States had 238 officers, and Canada had 201, according to 2011 data. Not surprisingly, some studies suggest that adding police officers reduces crime. ""A nation with a larger proportion of police officers is somewhat more likely to have a lower crime rate,"" said a 2006 reportby the Institute for the Study of Civil Society, which looked at law enforcement data from European countries. Just weeks before the gang rape in New Delhi on Dec.16, the Indian Supreme Court laid down guidelines to check sexual harassment, including greater deployment of female police officers in public spaces: All states and Union Territories are directed to depute plain-clothed female police officers in the precincts of bus-stands and stops, railway stations, metro stations, cinema theatres, shopping malls, parks, beaches, public service vehicles, places of worship to monitor and supervise incidents of sexual harassment. But, without significant increase in hiring, that may be difficult. Thenumber of female police constables in the country was only 84,479 out of 1,585,117 officers, or about 5 percent of the total police force in 2011. India's judiciary is also considered understaffed. The country's judge-to-population ratio would be the fourth lowest in the world, if the country were included in a 2008 U.N. study that looked at 65 countries. Only Guatemala, Nicaragua and Kenya had a lower ratio than India, which only had 14 judges per million population in 2008.",2013,"India"
"211","Scattered Protests in Delhi on Republic Day","Asia","Several groups of protesters marched and demonstrated in New Delhi on Saturday as India celebrated its 64th Republic Day, demanding better safety for women, a movement that started after the Dec. 16 gang rape of a young woman here. A march of several hundred students, organized by the All India Students' Association, sat on the street at Jantar Mantar, a designated protest area in central Delhi. The protesters carried the placards bearing slogans including, ""No Violence Against Women,""l ""Unknown Citizen,"" and ""Freedom Without Fear."" They shouted slogans including, ""We Want Justice"" and ""Rajpath is yours. Janpath is ours."" (Rajpath is the street where the official Republic Day parade passes and Janpath is where the protesters began their march.) ""We want to counter the notion that women are safe inside. We want women to be safe outside,"" said Oshin Siao Bhatt, a student at Miranda House College of Delhi University who attended. ""In 2012 only one rapist was convicted in Delhi while about 600 rapes took place,"" Shafaq Khan, a philosophy student at Jawaharlal Nehru University said. ""We want to reclaim our republic."" At another rally organized by the Progressive Democratic Student Union, protesters' placards proclaimed: ""Respect The Sex Which Gave You Birth"" and ""Punish The Police, Sensitize Judiciary, Eradicate Rape."" At a third, placards read, ""We Want Safety, Not Compensation,"" referring to the money given by government to the family of the rape victim, and ""We Want Justice Not Dates,"" referring to the judicial delays. At a fourth protest rally, an activist, Arvind Kejriwal, who has formed the Aam Admi, or Common Men, party to run for election, told a crowd that if the right people enter into politics, violence against women will decline. One small group of protesters had created a funeral pyre that they said represented the Delhi rape victim, and said they would not move themselves until the rapists were hanged.",2013,"India"
"212","India Goes Backwards on Human Rights","Asia","The protection of human rights in India took a turn for the worse in 2012, Human Rights Watch said on Friday. India experienced continued incidents of violence against women, failed to provide protection for freedom of speech and continued to not hold public officials accountable for wrongdoing, the rights group said. The sharply critical assessment of India comes as part of 655-page annual review of human rights across more than 90 countries by Human Rights Watch. It was released on Friday. India's major problem in protecting human rights is the gap between noble intentions and action, Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in an interview. ""There are often very good intentions, and the right things are said at the very highest level of government, but we don't often see it translate on the ground,"" Ms. Ganguly said.  ""The strong statements made by the government have to make a difference for people interacting with the lowest level of government"" for human rights to improve, she said. In its report, Human Rights Watch condemned the unabated sexual violence against women in India, which has garnered national and international attention in the past month. Reflecting on the Dec. 16 gang rape and subsequent death of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi, Ms. Ganguly said that the government's effort to respond swiftly, by releasing the Verma Commission report outlining recommendations for changes in how sexual assault was handled in the country, was laudable. But that effort needs to be combined with more systemic change, she said. ""At the Prime Minister's level and the cabinet level there might be much desire for change,"" Ms. Ganguly said, but the police officer on the ground who is supposed to register a case of rape is the face of the state. ""What happens when he doesn't?"" she asked.  India needs a stronger system of accountability for public officials and better training and sensitization of the police , she said. The execution of Ajmal Kasab, convicted for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and the renewed calls for the death penalty to be applied for those convicted of the New Delhi gang rape, showed a regression in criminal justice in India, Human Rights Watch said. The lack of protection for freedom of speech and the misapplication of a colonial-era sedition law continues to undermine the development of civil society and the space for dissent in India, the report said. In 2012 there were various incidents of the state curbing free speech, including the use of sedition laws to attack civil society activists in Maoist insurgent areas, sedition charges lodged against a cartoonist for a work that mocked corruption in the Indian government and the application of draconian Internet laws. ""There is always this argument from the top level of government in India that we believe in total freedom of speech but are concerned about law and order,"" Ms. Ganguly said. ""However, whenever certain interest groups attempt to curb freedom of speech the government submits to these threats of violence."" Rather than trying to understand and embrace social media as a platform for debate, the Indian government is heavy handed, she said, and is worried about what is said on Twitter while it arrests people for Facebook posts, she said. The ban on YouTube and Facebook in Kashmir and the arrest of two young women in Mumbai for their Facebook activity are two such incidences. Moving forward, the report said that India needs to revoke the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which allows soldiers to commit serious human rights violations, in order to tackle the culture of impunity within the country's defense establishment. The report also pointed to abuses by government and opposition forces in India's conflict-torn areas such as Jammu and Kashmir, and in the northeastern states and villages considered Maoist insurgent areas. There have been some positive steps taken by the government in the past year, Human Rights Watch said, including the protection of children from sexual abuse, encouragement of medical care centers, the conviction of suspects in the 2002 Gujarat riots and support for the protection of human rights in other countries. The report noted India's effort to support United Nations resolutions to promote human rights in countries such as Sri Lanka and Syria. However, Ms. Ganguly said that while India harbors ambitions to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the country fails to express a clear policy on various international situations. India's policy tends to be reactive, Ms. Ganguly said, with the only constant an   insistence on not interfering in the matters of other countries. ""If India is going to be an emerging power, its global role cannot be 'We will not speak for the human rights of citizens of other countries,' "" she said.",2013,"India"
"213","Pakistan's Media Police","Asia","ISLAMABAD - Maria Khan, the host of a Pakistani television talk show, raided a massage parlor in a private residence in Lahore last week and accused the women working there of being prostitutes. Accompanied by the police, Khan and her ""Baat Say Baat"" camera crew threatened the employees with arrest, rifled through their purses, and cross-examined them about their work. The women's faces were caught on camera despite their repeated requests not to be filmed. Khan made racist comments about the parlor's Chinese owner, and even went so far as to contact the father of one employee and accuse him of pimping out his daughter. Pakistani liberals are condemning Khan's show as the latest incident of moral policing by Pakistan's feisty independent media. Much criticism has focused on the fact that Khan violated the privacy of the parlor's employees and trespassed on private property to film the episode. Khan is also drawing comparisons to Maya Khan, another talk-show host who early last year aired a segment in which she chased down and chastizedunmarried couples out on dates in Karachi's parks. But the recent show is more alarming in its similarity to a raid conducted by radicalized seminary students on a massage parlor in Islamabad almost six years ago. The parallels between the two incidents demonstrate how extremist ideologies have entered the Pakistani mainstream - and can even be counted on to get high ratings on local television. In 2007, students of the Jamia Hafsa, a seminary in Islamabad's notorious Lal Masjid (Red Mosque), raided a Chinese-owned massage parlor, accused the Chinese nationals employed there of being prostitutes, and abducted them. The confrontation led to concerns about Taliban-style vigilantism and moral policing in the Pakistani capital, and prompted the Chinese authorities to contact the Pakistani government and demand that extremists be brought under control. In July of that year, the Pakistani Army took up arms against the seminary students and militants backing them - many of whom were veterans of the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s and since 2001. The showdown unleashed a wave of revenge suicide bombings against Pakistan's security forces and civilians, leaving hundreds dead. That the ideologies and practices of the Lal Masjid militants are now the stuff of prime-time television is a cause for serious concern. [Video: Watch on Youtube.] Pakistan's privately owned television channels rely on advertising revenue - tariffs that are based on high ratings - to operate. Television producers and anchors therefore resort to sensationalism to attract viewers. In this context, some commentators believe Khan's parlor raid was simply an excuse to broadcast titillating content. But such games are liable to backfire in Pakistan's increasingly conservative society, creating greater support for extremist viewpoints. Khan's show was broadcast at a time when the Supreme Court is pressuring the country's media regulator to define and censor ""obscene"" content. Last month, the Supreme Court also ordered an investigation into blasphemy charges against Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States. In 2011, Rehman appeared on Pakistan's Dunya TV channel and criticized the country's draconian blasphemy laws. A viewer of the show deemed her critique tantamount to blasphemy and filed a complaint against her. In such a prohibitive and intolerant environment, it's becoming harder to tell whether the media are concerned about entertaining or censuring the Pakistani public.",2013,"Pakistan"
"214","Delhi Gang Rape Trial Progresses, Despite Recent Death","Asia","Ram Singh, the bus driver accused in the Delhi gang rape, was found hanging in his prison cell Monday, but the trial of four other men in the fatal attack on a young woman continues in a special fast-track court. As of Wednesday afternoon, the prosecution had called 47 of their more than 90 witnesses. They include the 23-year-old physiotherapy student's male companion, who was also brutally attacked and injured, doctors from the hospital in Singapore where the woman was transferred for treatment and ultimately died, and doctors who analyzed crucial forensic evidence and prepared a detailed DNA report. The trial of the five men, who pleaded not guilty to 13 criminal charges including gang rape, murder and robbery, began Feb. 5 in Saket District Court. They are being tried in one of six fast-track courts established for cases of sexual assault after the gang rape sparked massive protests calling for better protection for women. A sixth defendant, who is a minor, is being tried before a juvenile board. The young woman was stripped and raped by several men in the back of a moving bus, attacked repeatedly with a metal rod and thrown, with her male companion, onto a highway on the night of Dec. 16. She was treated at hospitals in India and Singapore but died from her injuries on Dec. 29. Yogesh Khanna, an additional sessions judge, has conducted hearings on almost every weekday since the trial started. In the coming months, the examination and cross-examination of the prosecution's witnesses will be followed by an examination of witnesses for the defense and the recording of the statements of the accused. The trial will close with lawyers from both sides presenting their arguments, and then Judge Khanna will make a decision. If the five men are found guilty, they could be punished with the death sentence. Defense lawyers predict the trial will continue for at least another two months, but the public prosecutor said it was tough to predict a time frame. ""It is hard to say,"" said Rajiv Mohan in an interview by phone. ""Some witness examinations take days, and others are completed in just a few hours."" Among other things, protesters who took to the streets in December were demanding that trials involving crimes against women be conducted speedily. Rape trials can often take months or years to resolve in India. Information about the court proceedings remains scarce after the judge declared the hearings ""in camera,"" or accessible only to those directly connected with the case, and imposed a blanket ban on reporting by the media. Some information has trickled out as defense lawyers speak with journalists outside the court hall, but information has often proved unreliable. The case took an unexpected turn earlier this week, when the driver of the bus in which the rape allegedly took place was found hanging from the ceiling of his cell in Tihar Jail. His lawyer and parents contend that Mr. Singh could not have committed suicide and allege that he was murdered. ""I suspect there is foul play,"" said V.K. Anand, the lawyer representing Mr. Singh and his brother Mukesh, who is also on trial in the gang rape case. ""There were no circumstances for committing suicide. His mental state was stable, the trial was going well, he was meeting with his family."" Mr. Anand said this development will affect the trial as Mr. Singh was the ""main accused,"" an assertion the prosecution denied. Mr. Mohan said Mr. Singh's death would have ""no impact,"" as the statements of the bus driver carries less weight than forensic evidence or the statement of other witnesses to the crime. On Tuesday, defense lawyers expressed concern in court over the safety of the remaining defendants, who they say are vulnerable to attacks from fellow inmates and jail authorities. ""If we can't expect safety of the accused,"" said A.P. Singh, who is representing two of the defendants, ""how can we expect justice for them?"" The judge has asked jail authorities for daily briefings on the security arrangements for the prisoners.",2013,"India"
"215","The Malala Backlash","Asia","LONDON - When Malala Yousafzai, the girls' education activist who was shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban last October, addressed the United Nations on her 16th birthday last week, she called for education for all, including the children of violent extremists. But while Westerners gushed over her bravery, the reaction in Pakistan was decidedly tepid, if not plain hostile. The government did not acknowledge Malala Day, as the U.N. has now dubbed July 12 in the hope of raising awareness about education. And young Pakistanis - including people from the urban, middle-class and Internet-savvy set - have lashed out against Yousafzai on social media. Some are calling her ""Malala Dramazai,"" suggesting that she staged the attack to gain fame and get asylum abroad. Others say she is a C.I.A. agent. Why? The ""Malala backlash,"" as the novelist Bina Shah puts it, ""illustrates the fact that most Pakistanis are very confused."" National pride is a complicated thing in a country that has yet to sort out its identity. You can see this discomfort in the three main complaints of Yousafzai's critics: Her fame highlights Pakistan's most negative aspect (rampant militancy); her education campaign echoes Western agendas; and the West's admiration of her is hypocritical because it overlooks the plight of other innocent victims, like the casualties of U.S. drone strikes. Yousafzai is not the first Pakistani to bring out the nation's muddled sense of itself. Last year, after Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy became the first Pakistani to win an Oscar for her documentary on female victims of acid attacks, she was accused of exploiting vulnerable women and vilifying Pakistan as part of a Western-backed campaign. (I, too, questioned whether all the excitement was warranted, given the troubling implications.) There's also the case of Mukhtar Mai, who took to court the men who had gang-raped her in 2002 rather than remain silent, as is culturally expected. Glamour magazine named her Woman of the Year in 2005. But back home she was accused of capitalizing on the crime, ruining Pakistan's international image and ""conspiring against Islam."" The then President Pervez Musharraf went so far as to say rape was a ""money-making concern"" that Pakistani women used to get visas to travel and reside abroad. These virulent reactions seem odd in a country that purports to value education and women's rights. But that is simply a sign that Pakistan is still struggling to figure itself out - to figure out how to participate in the modern, global economy as it comes to terms with its colonial past, to reject Western pressure while coveting international approval, to strengthen its democratic institutions as an Islamic republic.

"216","Freedom for Midnight's Daughters","Asia","Independence came to India at the stroke of midnight, that hour of darkness and, often, danger. The appointed time on August 15, 1947, for India's ""tryst with destiny"" was chosen by astrologers, who deemed it auspicious for the country's birth. Since then the midnight hour has become synonymous with freedom. Is that the case for women, though? It is worth interpreting that question literally for just a moment, as others have done. ""Just because India achieved freedom at midnight does not mean that women can venture out after dark,"" Botsa Satyanarayana, a Congress Party politician, said in a statement following the Delhi gang rape last December. Referring to the young student who later died as a result of her injuries, he added, ""The woman should have thought twice before boarding the suspicious private bus that night. Though the incident was condemnable, she should also have behaved keeping in mind the situation."" Such statements are not rare. In the coastal state of Goa, known for palm-lined beaches and late-night parties, one lawmaker argued that rape occurring past the midnight hour should be treated, in his words, ""on a different footing."" In 2008, Sheila Dixit, the chief minister of Delhi, pointed out that when the TV journalist Soumya Viswanathan was murdered in New Delhi, she had been ""all by herself till 3 a.m. at night in a city where people believe... you know... you should not be so adventurous."" India is not alone in facing a crisis of women's rights. In every country on the globe there are police stations, newsrooms and dinner tables where rape survivors are blamed for the crimes committed against them. It is equally problematic to ignore how perceptions of freedom vary across class, regional and professional backgrounds. A girl in Mumbai, Delhi or Calcutta dancing the night away at a club, a young woman in one of the information technology centers whose late-night shift grants her financial independence, might say she feels liberated at all hours of the day. Looking at freedom at midnight in such an expansive way is instructive, up to a certain point. But on Independence Day, Indians celebrate a very specific midnight, which promised a very specific kind of freedom. When, as Salman Rushdie wrote in ""Midnight's Children,"" the ""clock-hands joined palms in respectful greeting,"" millions celebrated the end of colonialism and the beginning of swaraj, or self-rule, in the form of a modern nation-state. So, can we take for granted that all women have been liberated from oppressive, undemocratic rule? The question might seem preposterous - the British, after all, have quit India. However, in many parts of the country, poor governance means that the state is too weak to effectively protect constitutional rights and enforce laws. What is particularly worrying is that, in some places, this has led to undemocratic non-state actors ruling over women against their will. I am referring to the notorious khap panchayats, or ""caste councils,"" which operate in north Indian states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. These age-old councils intervene in village disputes related to property, inheritance and marriage. Because they are free, effective and swift, many villagers turn to them instead of the police, who often demand bribes. The sizeable backlog of cases in the judicial system only increases their  appeal. These councils, run by male, unelected leaders, have been repeatedly criticized for their sexist rulings. In recent years, khap panchayats in various villages have banned women from owning mobile phones, wearing T-shirts and jeans and having so-called ""love marriages"" in which women chose their husbands independent of their families. The councils' most controversial role, however, has been in legitimizing honor killings, which are often carried out as a response to love marriages. In places where khap panchayats exist, the precepts of the modern Indian nation-state are undermined; the khaps have the final say, not the government. On December 23, 2012, the Indian government constituted a three member committee headed by Justice J.S. Verma, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India, to recommend amendments to the Criminal Law so as to provide for quicker trial and enhanced punishment for criminals accused of committing sexual assault against women. ""They overrule, with impunity, the constitutionally mandated administration of equality in favour of women,"" the Verma Committee wrote about the khap panchayats in its influential report. This is why, in theory, they are not allowed to operate. In 2011, the Supreme Court ruled in unequivocal terms that khap panchayats are ""kangaroo courts"" that need to be ""ruthlessly stamped out."" In spite of this, these councils continue to issue ordinances that severely restrict the freedom of women and ignore their fundamental rights. They prevail thanks to the fierce protection granted by politicians who rely on them for precious vote banks. Some of their guardians are powerful, like the former chief minister of Haryana, Om Prakash Chautala, who is reported to have said in 2004 that ""whatever the caste panchayat decides is right."" Later, in 2012, he said he agreed with one khap's suggestion that the marriageable age for women should be lowered to prevent rape. Until the state reins in the khap panchayats, women living under their rule will be denied the full freedoms promised to them at that historic midnight hour. Women in other parts of the country are also being denied full democratic freedoms, but for other reasons. Rather than suffering from weak governance, they are being crushed by an excessively strong state. In so-called ""disputed areas,"" like Kashmir and the northeast, the state does not afford citizens the same rights as in other parts of the country. Civic freedoms, such as the right to assemble, are denied and the military has the right to shoot at unauthorized gatherings of more than five people. Embodying this oppression is the Armed Forces Special Powers Act.  Along with other powers, the A.F.S.P.A. grants legal immunity to soldiers, thereby protecting them from prosecution in cases of murder and rape. It is for reasons like these that the United Nations has declared the A.F.S.P.A. to be a ""symbol of excessive state power."" Women in particular have been severely affected by military might in these areas, as was acknowledged in the Verma Committee report, which stated, ""Impunity for systematic or isolated sexual violence in the process of Internal Security duties is being legitimized by the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which is in force in large parts of our country."" One of the most striking reflections of how women under A.F.S.P.A. feel was a protest that took place in the northeastern state of  Manipur in 2004, following the death of Thangjam Manorama, a 32-year-old woman, who was taken into custody by the Assam Rifles - a paramilitary force in India - and later found dead, her body riddled with bullets and showing signs of sexual assault and torture. The security forces alleged that she was a member of the Manipur-based insurgent group, People's Liberation Army. Ordinary women took off their clothes to protest in front of the army that day, and the reasons they gave for doing so were chilling. Describing the protest to Human Rights Watch, one woman said ""We mothers were weeping, 'Now our daughters can be raped. They can be subjected to such cruelty. Every girl is at risk.' We shed our clothes and stood before the army. We said, 'We mothers have come. Drink our blood. Eat our flesh. Maybe this way you can spare our daughters.' But nothing has been done to punish those soldiers. The women of Manipur were disrobed by the A.F.S.P.A. We are still naked."" There will be those who think that Independence Day is not the moment to bring up these difficult issues. But if we look back to the ceremony of India's first Independence Day, we see that Nehru acknowledged the pain that many across the country were feeling, even while the rest of the nation rejoiced. ""Before the birth of freedom we have endured all the pains of labor and our hearts are heavy with the memory of this sorrow,"" he said that day, adding that ""some of those pains continue even now."" Nothing that Nehru said in his momentous speech indicated that those pains would be remedied quickly. If anything, he said that the future would be ""not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving"" to fulfill the pledges made at Independence. This year has been marked by great striving. Indians of all backgrounds have taken to the streets to march against the oppression of women. Citizens have written petitions, painted banners, organized protests, mobilized friends and tirelessly raised awareness about gender-related injustices that are yet to be addressed. There is still much to do. ""We have to labor and to work, and work hard, to give reality to our dreams,"" Nehru told his newly awakened nation. Judging from this year, the midnight children - both men and women - have already rolled up their sleeves and are busy at work.

"217","Is Sexual Abuse of Minors Worse in India? Ink Readers Debate","Asia","The recent death of a 4-year-old girl from Madhya Pradesh, who succumbed to her injuries days after she was raped and dumped near a crematorium in her hometown of Ghansor, has evoked an overwhelming response from India Ink readers. Some readers are outraged by the brutality of the crime and attribute it to the skewed sex ratio, which they say is causing this unnatural behavior among men. A few others feel that arrests made in this case show that authorities are taking some action toward perpetrators of crimes against women; noting the reporting of such cases has been on the rise. ""Renata2021,"" a reader from Massachusetts, wrote, ""As horrific as this story is, the only reason it is 'news' is that authorities are investigating and have made an arrest. This reflects fairly recent improvements in civil rights for women, children and the poor in India."" The reader added, ""When authorities begin to take these events seriously, citizens feel more confident about reporting criminal and anti-social behavior and communities demand more of their citizens."" The same reader, who did not give his or her name, said that change could be ushered into Indian society through ""education and other reforms long needed but long ignored."" ""APS"" from California argued that, according to an Indian religious leader, ""increased consumption of meat and alcohol"" is the reason for the rising occurrence of rape in India, but ""nowhere do they note that there is a steady rise in female feticide/infanticide in India."" This reader also wrote that, ""the gender ratio is unnatural, causing too much of testosterone in the society,"" which ""gets exhibited through violent acts."" Echoing a similar view, Alison West from New York wrote that, aborting female fetuses, a practice that she says should be banned, is ""creating a growing and serious imbalance between men and women."" She contends, ""As heterosexual young men are less and less able to find wives, they will be less and less able to enjoy normal and open emotional and sexual relations."" Ms. West also states that, ""Female feticide will lead to the disenfranchisement of women, who will be made to feel that their only value is in marriage and breeding children,"" and they will lose their ""voice in the public arena as their numbers fall in relation to men."" ""Proud American"" from Minnesota weighs in by saying that, ""There are no easy causes of this malaise affecting India."" But is quick to add, that the ""girl child is undesirable due to prevalence of fat weddings and practice of dowry which can break the backs of middle/lower middle-class people."" According to this reader, children of migrant workers become easy targets of sexual violence. When these families travel to cities in search for work, they are often unable to afford secure accommodation, or properly care for their children, who are then left more exposed to ""depraved persons."" Proud American offers some suggestions to tackle this problem, including punishing perpetrators of female infanticide, subsidizing education, and ""making a college degree mandatory for a political career."" As the reader argues, ""Uneducated leaders don't make sound policies necessarily."" Improving the quality of programming on cable network that ""shows uninhibited levels of filth"" could also help, according to the Proud American. Romy from New York City offers a more stringent approach to deal with rising crimes against women in India. ""Don't spend one penny in that country or purchasing exports from there until true enforcement and country-wide policies are in place to protect women and female children,"" she wrote in referring to India. Urging people to ""stand up for change,"" and put an end to the recent spate of sexual assaults on women and children in India, she asks:  Are there any Indian movie stars, sports players, intellectuals out there who are willing to put a face on needed change? ""Notable Skeptic"" from Cambridge, Mass., throws open a question to fellow readers and people who oppose the death penalty even for the most heinous crimes. ""What's the appropriate punishment for this crime? I'd love to hear specifically from people who are against the death penalty and torture."" This reader also wrote that Indian society is to be blamed for ""not properly assimilating"" the man who raped the 4-year-old girl.

"218","Detention of Critic of Child Abuse Draws Ire in China","Asia","BEIJING - The first urgent message came at 11.41 in the morning of Thursday, May 30: Ye Haiyan, a campaigner against child abuse and for the rights of sex workers and those with HIV/AIDS, wrote that her home had been invaded and she was being physically attacked in Bobai, Guangxi Province. ""Now there are four or five women in my home, beating me,"" wrote 37-year-old Ms. Ye on Sina Weibo, the discussion platform that is often likened to China's ""town square."" She had just returned from nearby Hainan Island where she had taken part in a mocking protest outside a school whose principal had allegedly raped several girls, one of many cases of child sex abuse that have come to light in China recently, attracting widespread attention and disgust. A minute later, at 11:42, Ms. Ye pleaded: ""Please everyone call the police, there's only me and my daughter at home."" At 11:58: ""11 people in total. One is a man. About 10 women."" And the last message at 11:59, before she disappeared into 13-day-long police detention: ""They're still blocking the stairs at my building. Please everyone report it to the police. Though it's no use. But I still want a record, to solve it through legal means."" Here's a screenshot of Ms. Ye on the homepage of her Weibo account: Public attention on Ms. Ye, a well-know advocate for women and children's rights, was already high for her staging of the Hainan protest, during which she stood in front of the Wanning Elementary School with a placard that read: ""Principal, if you want to 'get a room' look for me; leave the students alone!"" The protest was in connection with a case in early May where the school principal and another state employee were accused of molesting or raping six girls in a hotel. The facts remain unclear, with the Wanning police and the girls' parents offering different accounts. The principal has been arrested and charged, the South China Morning Post reported, citing Xinhua, the state news agency, And currently there is intense interest among ordinary Chinese over Ms. Ye's fate; activists have launched a campaign for people to send police postcards supporting Ms. Ye, and post online photos of themselves holding up the postcards. Some have posted online photographs of themselves with copies of Ms. Ye's sign, including the dissident Ai Weiwei (who wrote the words on his belly.) After a feminist-themed play in Beijing this week in a private theater, actresses appealed to the audience to support Ms. Ye, with some analyzing the police action as part of a push by officials to drive her out of Bobai and Guangxi province, where officials regard her as a ""troublemaker."" The police said they detained Ms. Ye for using a knife during the incident and injuring three persons. Ms. Ye's lawyer, Wang Yu, said she was acting in self-defense; Ms. Ye herself has written about being attacked in the past by people she calls ""alternative mafia"" saying: ""people in the government are out to get me,"" according to this translation available on The Shanghaiist blog. According to Ms. Wang, the people barged into her home uninvited and threatened her verbally and physically. Ms. Ye is suing the police, seeking cancellation of her detention order and 10,000 renminbi in compensation for mental suffering. Reached by telephone, a person at the the Bobai Public Security Bureau who identified herself as a policewoman declined to discuss details of the case, but seemed anxious to disown Ms. Ye. ""Ye Haiyan is not from Bobai. She just lives here,"" said the woman, who gave her surname as Qin, declining to give her first name. Asked about the incident, she referred a caller to the Bobai police Weibo account. She then hustled a caller off the phone, saying the line should only be used ""for work purposes."" On the police Weibo account is a short statement, posted on June 3, saying: ""Ye Haiyan has been detained for 13 days for intentional injury; it has nothing to do with her online action""  - an apparent reference to the Hainan protest, images of which circulated widely online. The account showed what it said was a ""vegetable knife"" (it looks like a chopper) allegedly used by Ms. Ye to attack the three women, whom the police said were the owners of hotels in the area which last year were identified by Ms. Ye as ""10 kuai brothels,"" used by the cheapest of prostitutes. The women claimed their family and business reputations were injured by Ms. Ye. Ms. Ye is well known for an action last year where she offered herself as a 10 renminbi (about a dollar and a half) prostitute, to highlight the plight of women who offer sex for that small amount. She says many are fleeing abusive husbands or working to support children alone, and are often picked up by the police and fined, or jailed. Here's how the Global Network of Sex Work Projects, a non-governmental organization, describes Ms. Ye: ""Ye has a long history of activism related to gender, child abuse, and sex work. She blogs avidly about women's rights in China, and is known for volunteering as a no-fee sex worker at a '10 RMB brothel' to protest the poor working conditions of migrant sex workers. She was also attacked in 2010, after organizing China's first sex workers' rally."" Here's how Frontline Defenders, a human rights NGO that has issued an appeal for her, described the incident in Ms. Ye's home last week: ""In an effort to defend herself and her daughter she used a knife to drive her attackers away, reportedly injuring three of them in the process. Shortly thereafter she was taken into custody by police and is being detained on suspicion of 'causing intentional injury'."" Ms. Ye is due to be released next week.",2013,"China"
"219","In China, a Controversial Law Is Seen to Excuse Sex With Minors","Asia","BEIJING - When Yan Yinhong, having removed a pair of pants from under her long dress, did a handstand and exposed her leotard-covered crotch onto which she had painted the face of a Chinese policeman, she intended to shock. Ms. Yan's act was part of a bigger feminist art show on a recent Saturday afternoon: ""Bald Girls: A Door."" Sexual violence was a key theme of the four performances, as this week's Female Factor Letter explores. Another artist, Li Xinmo, put a razor blade in her mouth as she painfully told the story of a father raping his daughter in the shower. Blood seeped from her mouth. Recent news reports about the sexual abuse or rape of school students by teachers has drawn attention to a normally hidden issue here. For feminists, a law in force since 1997 is particularly galling: A person who has sex with a minor - the age of consent here is 14 - may not be automatically charged with rape if he can prove the sex was consensual and commercial. Known, literally, as ""spending the night in a brothel with a girl child"" - ""piaosu younü""  - article 360 of the Criminal Law is a target of children's rights activists and feminists, who say men use it as a loophole to have sex with minors. Feminists say the law damages children's rights by voiding the notion of statutory rape. Rape of minors still exists as a crime, but men are using this legal loophole to get off lightly, they say, paying off or intimidating a victim's parents to agree the sex was consensual or commercial. The crime carries a minimum of 5 years jail time, according to multiple Chinese media reports, but in practice, men have gotten off with fines and a couple weeks' detention, according to legal experts.  Rape carries the maximum penalty of death though it can also entail as little as three years jail, the Southern Weekly newspaper reported. The law's very name ""disgusts"" people, Southern Weekly wrote last year. ""On Children's Day in 2012, the author Han Han, raised the question: a girl child is girl child, rape is rape. What is 'spending the night in a brothel with a girl child'? He said, this evil law must be repealed."" Southern Weekly cited Zhou Guangquan, a member of the National People's Congress legal committee, as saying that a reason for creating the separate crime was related to the desire to lessen the use of the death penalty in China, bowing to ""international pressure."" Its defenders pointed out that with a minimum of 5 years in jail, it was not a lightly punished crime, the newspaper wrote. Yet Southern Weekly painted an arbitrary picture of how the law was created in the first place. Revisions to the criminal law published by the Congress on March 1, 1997, held that commercial sex with minors ""was still rape,"" the newspaper cited Lin Wei, an expert on youth law, as saying. ""Twelve days later it had changed. On March 13, 1997, the meeting passed the draft law and it was a separate crime,"" the newspaper wrote. The very next day it became law. How it all happened is ""very hard to tell from publicly available information,"" the newspaper wrote.",2013,"China"
"220","They Don't Want to Become 'Bravehearts'","Asia","A 22-year-old Mumbai photojournalist has become as unfortunately iconic as the young woman known as ""Nirbhaya,"" the 23-year-old physiotherapist student who became the rallying call to the barricades after she was gang-raped on Dec. 16, 2012 in Delhi, while returning home on a bus. A male companion proved to be no safeguard and was also severely assaulted. She later died from her injuries. Like Nirbhaya, the Mumbai girl gang-raped on Thursday was doing nothing more reckless than being on a routine assignment, again with a male colleague, at a derelict textile mill in the heart of the city; it was close to the peak-hour Mahalaxmi commuter railway station. This equally fearless girl has fortunately survived, and, despite her trauma and injuries, has helped the police make swift arrests. The Mumbai gang rape disrupted Parliament, the opposition seizing this as one more weapon against the Congress-led alliance already staggering under serial corruption scandals, rising prices and a rupee in free fall. But the Indian media has led from the front as it had done in the Nirbhaya case, as it had to gain justice for Jessica Lal, the vivacious model shot dead by a politically connected man in 1999 merely because she refused to serve him a drink at a Delhi nightclub after the bar was closed, and as it had for Ruchika Girhotra, the 14-year-old athlete who committed suicide after being molested by no less than an inspector general of police in nearby Chandigarh in 1990. This time, the media is fighting for one of its own. Among ordinary citizens there is both outrage and fear. But, alas, no disbelief - the unrelenting vortex of sexual violence has left no room for that. For the past year,  Mumbai has squandered its reputation as a city safe for its working women. Just weeks after the Nirbhaya case had paralyzed the capital, a child as young as 5 was raped in Delhi. The grim rollcall continued with blatant perversity even as the Justice Verma commission, set up to sharpen the law on sexual violence, completed its task with exemplary diligence and speed. By April, the resulting Criminal Law Amendment bill had breezed through Parliament. But the reports of rape, vindictive acid attacks and other gender-based violence have increased. The police defensively argue that so has the conviction rate, which is not saying much. In Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, thanks to slovenly evidence collection, it was an abysmal 8.2 percent in 2011, inching to 9.1 percent in 2012. Even the 15 percent of the first quarter of 2013 gives no cause for reassurance. The increasing vulnerability of Indian women is all the more ironic in its cities flaunting their new mall-to-mall carpet of globalization. It is most unnerving in Mumbai, whose women across classes had long been empowered and safe on its streets. This was because they had made themselves visible here long before anywhere else. They went out to work as clerks in the Indo-Saracenic headquarters of city hall or the neo-Gothic Victoria Terminus, as white-lace collar stenographers in the imposing stone edifices of Ballard Estate, as magazine journalists and in the city's flashy advertising business. They went on to seize their place in new media, software and financial services, sashaying through the power towers of newer business districts. In a symbiotic sisterhood, their empowerment was made possible by Mumbai's unique army of part-time bais, no-nonsense domestic helpers from the city's ubiquitous slum-tenements who moved briskly from house to house to sweep, swab, wash dishes and dust the furniture. You could stand up to your boss, but if you wanted to keep your job, you never messed with your bai. Mumbai was once the friendliest city for working women. But overcrowding and underemployment, the clash between liberalized and hidebound attitudes, a decay of values, vigilante policemen going after private partying with a hockey stick instead of alertly patrolling beats to prevent rape and other crime - all these have turned India's showpiece into a city where dog can survive only by eating dog. Mumbai's women may still be the most liberated, boldly asserting themselves while they work and in their dealings with men, but even this intensifies their vulnerability. The 22-year-old photojournalist out with a male colleague in an abandoned mill at dusk could have been considered fair game by sexual predators. Quoting a police source, the Mumbai Mirror reported that One of five suspects crudely texted to the others to come over: ""The guests have arrived, come over to help us serve them."" Last September, Pallavi Purkayastha, a young lawyer with a live-in boyfriend, was viewed in much the same way by the watchman of her building in newly gentrified Wadala. He entered her flat with keys he had stolen when he was called up to attend to a power outage he had engineered, raped her and killed her when the plucky woman resisted. The man who threw a corrosive substance on Aryanka Hosbetkar's face three months later belonged to her cycling club, but he too didn't think she had the right to say ""no"" to his advances. Just a day earlier,  a Spanish exchange student had been sexually assaulted by a cat burglar in her apartment in the upmarket suburb of Bandra. Destructively, often fatally, Virginia Woolf's caution has come to haunt India's most ostensibly emancipated women: ""The eyes of others are our fetters, their thoughts our cages.""

"221","Japanese Politician Reframes Comments on Sex Slavery","Asia","TOKYO -- Seeking to quell an uproar over his recent comments suggesting that sexual slavery was a necessary evil in Japan's imperial past, a populist party leader said Monday that he had not meant to justify wartime brothels or deny the women's suffering at the hands of Japanese soldiers. But the politician, Toru Hashimoto, who is a co-leader of the opposition Japan Restoration Association and the mayor of Osaka, Japan's third-largest city, also argued that Japan was being unfairly singled out for its use of so-called comfort women, and that other nations needed to examine the mistreatment of women by their own militaries before pointing the finger at Tokyo. ''We must express our deep remorse at the violation of the human rights of these women by Japanese soldiers in the past, and make our apology to the women,'' Mr. Hashimoto said, speaking to journalists at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. But, he added, ''it is not a fair attitude to blame only Japan, as if the violation of human rights of women by soldiers were a problem unique to Japanese soldiers.'' The conduct of the Japanese military in Asia before and during World War II remains a highly charged topic in the region. Many of the country's neighbors say Japan has not properly atoned for its wartime atrocities, while segments of Japan's establishment feel that the country has been unfairly demonized. Some historians estimate that 200,000 women were rounded up to provide sex for the Japanese military. Other historians put that number in the tens of thousands and say the women served of their own will. Japan formally apologized to the women in 1993. Two South Koreans who served as ''comfort women'' canceled a meeting with Mr. Hashimoto last week, saying in a statement that they were heartbroken over his ''outrageous comments.'' Historians say the women in Japan's military brothels came from the Korean Peninsula, China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan, among other places. South Korea's foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, called Mr. Hashimoto's latest remarks ''embarrassing and shameful,'' and said they would ''further isolate Japan in the international community.'' Mr. Hashimoto charged that Britain, France, Germany, the Soviet Union and the United States were guilty of similar violations of women's rights in World War II, as were South Korean soldiers who served in the Vietnam War. He urged those countries to acknowledge their past before scrutinizing Japan's wartime history. He also invoked a belief shared by many Japanese, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, that there was no evidence to suggest that Japan's wartime government directly forced women to serve in the brothels. He brushed aside, as unreliable, testimony to the contrary from a number of women who had been enslaved. Mr. Hashimoto's comments followed those of a string of Japanese politicians who had recently challenged what they said was a distorted view of Japan's wartime history. Last month, Mr. Abe said the definition of ''invasion'' was relative. But even Mr. Abe and his cabinet have distanced themselves from Mr. Hashimoto in recent weeks. Mr. Hashimoto's remarks -- sometimes on Twitter -- have incited a furor among human rights groups here and have alienated much of the public. About 400 human rights activists staged a protest outside the Osaka city office this month, calling on him to resign. After he made his initial remarks on ''comfort women'' on May 13, the State Department called them ''outrageous and offensive.'' While the audience for Mr. Hashimoto's speech on Monday was made up of foreign journalists, his comments were as much a plea to domestic voters before parliamentary elections this summer as they were an attempt to sway global public opinion. Public approval ratings for Mr. Hashimoto, who was once seen as a possible contender for prime minister, have plunged. A smaller party has called off plans to cooperate with him in the elections, citing his remarks on women. During his speech, Mr. Hashimoto apologized for suggesting to a senior American military official stationed on the island of Okinawa that United States troops at bases there should make more use of the local adult entertainment industry to reduce sexual crimes against women. ''That was not what I meant,'' Mr. Hashimoto said. ''My real intention was to prevent a mere handful of American soldiers from committing crimes. In attempting to act on my strong commitment to solving the problem in Okinawa stemming from crimes committed by a minority of U.S. soldiers, I made an inappropriate remark.'' Still, Mr. Hashimoto did not shy away from delving into his interpretation of wartime brothels. Many brothels were run not by Japanese, but by local brokers on the Korean Peninsula and elsewhere, he said. And though some brothels were run by Japan's military, he said, the military's main task was to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases for the sake of the women. He stressed that while Japanese military boats and trucks were sometimes used to transport women to the brothels, the authorities themselves were not deeply involved in the coercion of women. He said he did not believe that Japan's actions amounted to human trafficking. Banri Kaieda, who leads the opposition Democratic Party, advised Mr. Hashimoto to stop talking before he made the situation even worse. ''There is a Chinese saying, 'You cannot wrap a fire with paper,' '' Mr. Kaieda said at a news conference. With Mr. Hashimoto, he said, ''it's as if he is trying to wrap it with oil instead.''",2013,"Japan"
"222","For Kolkata Rape Victim, a Lonely Wait for Justice","Asia","KOLKATA, West Bengal -In February 2012, a woman was gang-raped in a moving car after she was offered a lift from outside a nightclub on Kolkata's Park Street. Unlike the majority of rape victims in India, she decided to report the crime, not only to the Park Street police, but also to the media. With her back to the TV cameras, her frizzy hair being her only identifying feature, she fielded questions from journalists. Not long afterward, as she waited at a bus stop, another person saw her curls and asked, ""Are you the Park Street rape victim?"" The woman immediately fled the bus stop. After that, she began to tie up her hair every time she went outside. ""Even my family and friends now ask me to straighten my hair,"" said the woman, a 38-year-old Anglo-Indian who asked to be identified as Katrina. ""I am constantly identified everywhere I go. But why should I? I love my curls and always like to keep my hair open."" Since the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in Delhi last year shocked the nation, the central government has passed stronger laws on sex crimes and harassment of women, and the suspects are being tried in a fast-track court that was set up for sexual assault cases, which usually take years to conclude. Katrina's case is also in a fast-track court in Kolkata, where three of the five men she accused of raping her - Nishad Alam, Naseer Khan and Sumit Bajaj - began their trial in March. However, the Kolkata police commissioner, Surajit Kar Purakayastha, said the police are still looking for the other two men, Mohammad Ali and Kader Khan, the main suspect. However, tougher laws on crimes against women can't prevent the ostracization that occurs to rape victims in India, as Katrina has learned. For example, the chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, responded to the initial reports about the rape by saying Katrina had lied in order to make her government look bad. Hours later, an angry mob formed outside Katrina's apartment building. Katrina has also been receiving calls from unknown people who have threatened her or offered her money to withdraw the case, the last one as recently as April, which she reported to the police. The single mother of two teenage daughters decided to not take any chances with her safety. A former call center worker who was unemployed at the time of the rape, she has spent most of the past year at home while she looked for a job. ""I never stepped into a discotheque since then. I hardly go out with friends. I miss my life,"" she says wistfully, sipping tea and nibbling on croquettes at a reporter's house. She agreed to visit only after receiving reassurances that no one else would be home. Her sense of isolation grew as her neighbors - many of whom used to celebrate Christmas and the New Year at her apartment - began to grumble about her. Katrina often came home at odd hours when she was running a call center, but after she went public with the rape, she said that her neighbors complained about her comings and goings. ""No matter how early I returned, everyone would suggest I got back late - hinting that I was in the wrong and had invited my rape,"" Katrina said Whenever she had guests or her teenage daughters stepped out, she said her neighbors would whisper: ""Look! There they go!"" ""Luckily, I have very strong girls,"" she said. ""I know they will protest every injustice, but I am scared out of my wits for them."" Biswanath Acharya, one of her former neighbors, said the complaints about Katrina were purely for security reasons. ""We objected about the odd hours in which she would leave and return home, or some of her friends - usually male - would visit her."" His wife, Durga, said that while she supported Katrina's decision to report the rape, she said that they got updates on the case from television and never from her. ""We came to know from her landlord that she was facing a financial crisis as she couldn't pay her rent,"" she said. ""But we were not close enough to discuss about her job requirements. Frankly, looking at her, you wouldn't know she didn't have a job."" Katrina eventually moved, deciding that she didn't want to deal with the dirty looks and snide remarks. But even while she was looking for another apartment, she was reminded of her status as a rape victim. She said landlords would take her deposit, make inquiries about her and finally return the money. They would tell her, ""We can't rent this flat to you. Surely you know why,"" she recalled. The government was partly to blame for Katrina's plight since it didn't offer her much help, said Bharati Mutsuddi, a senior advocate of the Calcutta High Court, who was also a member of the West Bengal Commission for Women when the Left Front governed the state. ""The role of the state could have been to offer her succor, strongly supporting her in the case and to ensure she remains strong, mentally and physically,"" Ms. Mutsuddi said. The current head of the women's commission, Sunanda Mukherjee, said that the commission was already handling many cases and that Katrina needed to file a case with the commission if she wanted aid. Katrina ended up finding another apartment on her own, and, after many interviews that never went anywhere, another job. About six weeks ago, she was approached by Santasree Chaudhuri, an entrepreneur and a women's rights activist, to work at a hotline she founded for victims of sexual and domestic violence, called Survivors for Victims of Social Injustice. Ms. Chaudhuri, who was out of the country when Katrina's case was first reported in the media, learned about Katrina after returning to India and contacted her through a nongovernment organization. ""She came to my place and immediately offered me this job,"" Katrina said. She started the new job about six weeks ago. ""Now I meet so many women and encourage them to go on fighting for their rights, and it feels good to support them in this manner,"" said Katrina, who has been inspired to write a book about her own experience. Katrina said she was hopeful that the next generation will have a more sympathetic view of rape victims, as her daughters' friends have stood by them. ""No snide remarks, no ditching my darlings because of my rape. I've been to parent-teacher meetings, and my children's friends all surround me and chat,"" she said. She said although she had initially regretted coming forward about the rape, those feelings quickly dissipated, and now she was determined to see her case through to the end, no matter the cost. ""Had I died that night - and it's only a miracle that I am alive - people would have sympathized,"" she said. ""The fact that I am alive, screaming, protesting with courage no matter how much I am crumbling inside, makes everyone angry. How can a raped, brutalized woman still have so much of courage and voice? They want me to break down.""",2013,"India"
"223","Death of Victim Focuses Attention on Acid Attacks","Asia","NEW DELHI -When Preeti Rathi got off the train at Bandra Terminus station in Mumbai on May 2, she was looking forward to a new life in the city, where a job as a nurse awaited her. But the life of the 23-year-old from Delhi changed dramatically in a matter of seconds when an unidentified man doused her face with acid. ""I was walking alongside when a man came from behind and tapped Preeti on the shoulder,"" Amar Singh Rathi, the victim's father, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ""When she turned, he threw acid on her."" After battling for her life for nearly a month, Ms. Rathi succumbed to her burns and injuries on Saturday at a local hospital. Her family has accused the local authorities of bungling the investigation. The police have arrested two men, but one was released after he proved he was somewhere else at the time of the attack. Ms. Preeti's father has dismissed the other suspect as a scapegoat. ""The police have made these arrests to make a fool of the public and media and lead them astray,"" he said. Maharashtra's home minister, R.R. Patil, met with Ms. Rathi's parents on Sunday and assured them that the case would be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation, the top investigative agency in the country. Only a few months ago, this kind of assault, which is common in the Indian subcontinent, wouldn't have merited the attention from a home minister. It was only in February, after the Delhi gang rape generated outrage over the issue of violence against women, that Parliament passed a bill that created a separate criminal code for acid attacks. Before this, such attacks were prosecuted as a generic crime that caused physical injury or death. Acid attacks are almost always ""tied to gender inequality and discrimination,"" noted a 2011 study sponsored by the Avon Foundation for Women. The study also noted that attackers prefer to use hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric acids because they rapidly burn through flesh and bone: ""Perpetrators often intend to destroy what society considers to be one of the most valuable traits of a woman - her beauty."" Because acid attacks were only recently classified as a specific crime, the Indian government does not keep track of the number of cases. However, the Avon Foundation study found that the number of assaults reported in the media rose from 2002 to 2010. Acid Survivors Foundation reports from India and Pakistan have also recorded an increasing number of acid attacks in both countries, and both countries have underscored the gravity of the problem by passing legislation to strengthen penalties for these attacks. In India, the new law that recognizes acid attacks as a separate crime imposes a minimum penalty of 10 years in prison, with a maximum of life imprisonment, and a fine of up to 1 million rupees ($18,000). In Pakistan, the Parliament in 2011 made amendments to existing laws that criminalized such attacks, stipulating a minimum sentence of 14 years in prison, a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and fines up to 1 million Pakistani rupees ($10,200). The suicide of an acid attack victim in Pakistan last year galvanized public opinion, which put pressure on the government to introduce even stronger laws. A bill titled ""Acid Throwing and Burn Crime Bill 2012"" was introduced in the Parliament in Pakistan, which sought ""to redress the acid throwing and burn crimes which are increasing year by year."" However, the bill is still pending in Parliament. There is some evidence from Bangladesh that stricter laws can help reduce the number of acid attacks. Bangladesh passed laws against acid violence as early as 2002 and took steps to regulate the availability of the acids commonly used in such attacks. The Avon Foundation study found that Bangladesh has seen a decline in the number of reported acid attacks from 2000 to 2009. The strengthening of laws in India might help victims get justice; however, the laws do not necessarily serve as a deterrent. The easy availability of the acids used in these attacks is part of the problem, the study said. For example, a liter of hydrochloric acid costs between 16 to 25 rupees in India. For now, the father of Ms. Rathi said he wasn't concerned about current or future legislation to prevent attacks like the kind that killed his daughter. ""We don't want anything else but that the culprits be caught,"" he said.",2013,"India"
"224","From Nepal, a Push to End Human Trafficking","Asia","BEIJING - Human trafficking is one of the world's fastest-growing crimes,  the United Nations says, with nearly 21 million people falling victim each year. More than half of the victims of forced labor are from the Asia-Pacific region, the International Labor Organization estimates. It's a major policy challenge and in Asia, Nepal is leading the way in terms of legislation, according to the San Francisco-based Asia Foundation. Yet passing laws and implementing them are two different things, lawyers and activists say. In its 2012 report, the U.S. State Department warned that anti-trafficking laws were ""not well implemented"" in Nepal. Six years after the country passed landmark legislation to fight trafficking, the challenge is how to enforce it, said Sapana Pradhan Malla, one of the prime architects behind Nepal's Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act. We caught up with Ms. Pradhan Malla, a lawyer and advocate at Nepal's Supreme Court, this month after she received a Lotus Leadership Award from the Asia Foundation in New York for her work against human trafficking. Here is an edited version of the telephone interview: Another issue is how to measure justice for survivors. I recently worked on one case involving the trafficking of six girls from Nepal. The trafficker was sentenced to 117 years' imprisonment. When we asked the victims if they were satisfied with the length of the sentence, they said, ""Yes, but what about us? The accused doesn't have any property and the government doesn't have any mechanism to compensate us."" Justice is collectively demanded and individually experienced. Even if we have laws, how do we ensure that survivors feel like justice is being achieved? Most importantly, the root cause needs to be addressed - the poverty, illiteracy, corruption. In many human trafficking cases, people are lured by economic benefits. Intimidation is another problem. We've had six or seven cases where, during their hearing of their case, the victim either changed their statement or didn't appear as a witness. We've found that in the majority of cases victims are either threatened with their lives or lured by economic benefits. We don't have the resources to provide adequate security and protection for victims and witnesses. Even though Nepal shares a long border with China, it isn't very accessible, particularly compared to the Indian border. The Chinese government hasn't paid any attention to the issue. We need to implement cross-border mechanisms to monitor and implement strict work permits. It's the early stages and if we take it seriously, there is a possibility we can work with China to handle the situation. We need to create political stability in the country. It is most important to create opportunities inside the country, especially opportunities for economic empowerment.",2013,"Nepal"
"225","Photographer Is Gang-Raped in Mumbai","Asia","A female photographer with an English language magazine was raped by five men in Mumbai Thursday evening, undercutting Mumbai's image as the rare Indian city where women can safely move about in public spaces. The assault echoed the gang rape and murder of a woman in New Delhi in December, which set off an unprecedented wave of protests. The woman, 22, arrived at the abandoned, desolate compound of Shakti Mills, a defunct textile factory, around 6 p.m., accompanied by a male colleague. She was taking photographs of the area, now a trendy hub for media and advertising companies, for a magazine article about Mumbai's chawls, or tenements for workers who were once employed in the mills. Under Indian law, the authorities are not permitted to release the name of a rape victim or, in this case, the name of her employer. Lower Parel in Mumbai was the site of many textile mills until the 1980s, when manufacturing began to move out of the city. In more recent years, the area has undergone redevelopment. Several luxury apartment blocks are coming up in the area, but some abandoned mills remain. The five attackers are in their early 20s and live in an area near the abandoned textile mill, Mr. Singh said. Two of them have criminal records, he said. The police have not released their names. After the December attack, in which a physiotherapy student was gang-raped and beaten to death and her male friend severely beaten, tens of thousands protested for weeks throughout India, demanding a safer environment for women and heavier penalties for sexual assault. In March, India revised its colonial-era laws on sexual assault, imposing heavier punishments for violence against women and designating stalking and voyeurism as criminal offenses. Under the new laws, suspects will be subject to a minimum punishment of 20 years and a maximum of life imprisonment, if convicted. ""We will do our best to collect all scientific evidence to ensure that this is a foolproof case and that the culprits get maximum punishment,"" Mr. Singh said. The Mumbai police requested that the case be fast-tracked, something that is done in exceptional cases. But even then, the process can be slow. The Delhi gang-rape case was fast-tracked, but a verdict is still awaited seven months later. While Mumbai, India's financial capital, is widely considered one of the country's safest cities, recent events have brought that into question. According to statistics from the Praja Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Mumbai, 207 rape cases were registered in the city in 2011 and 2012, a 15 percent increase over 2010. The number of reported rapes nationwide is widely believed to be much lower than the actual number. The assault on the journalist in Mumbai has not brought protesters to the streets, but it triggered outrage and intense anger in the Indian news media. On Friday afternoon, about 50 journalists held a silent protest in Hutatuma Square at the heart of Mumbai's financial district. The protesters carried placards that read, ""City of Shame,"" ""Mumbai becomes India's new rape capital,"" ""Law of the jungle in city, Mumbai Police wake up"" and ""Safety for working journalists, security for toiling citizens."" On Friday, R.R. Patil, the home minister of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, told the Indian news media that female journalists reporting from isolated areas would be provided police protection, an idea that did not go over well with some. ""As a journalist, I should have the freedom to report from where I want, at par with my male colleagues,"" Deepti Sachdeva, a reporter with the Times Now television network, posted on Twitter. Gurbir Singh, an editor at BusinessWorld magazine, accused the Mumbai police of failing to clean up abandoned buildings and prevent them from becoming safe houses for criminals. ""The mill in question had been lying abandoned for some years and had become a center for drug abuse, the sale of illicit liquor and all sorts of criminal activities, and the police were aware of this,"" Mr. Singh said. Female Indian journalists recalled their own fears and difficult experiences. ""There have been several times when I was out on assignment taking pictures in isolated areas in Mumbai where I did not feel completely safe,"" said Anuja Gupta, a photographer with the Times of India Group. ""Especially as a female photographer, when we have to go to certain areas in the city or travel late at night, it is scary.""",2013,"India"
"226","Photojournalist Raped in Mumbai","Asia","MUMBAI- A female photojournalist on assignment in Mumbai was gang raped while her male colleague was tied up and beaten, the police said. Five men were being sought as suspects in the assault Thursday evening. ''She was taken to Jaslok Hospital with multiple injuries,'' said Rane, a head constable at the N.M. Joshi Marg police station in the Lower Parel neighborhood of Mumbai, where the case was registered. Mr. Rane refused to reveal his full name. The attack occurred around sunset, as the woman and her colleague were visiting Shakti Mills, an abandoned textile mill complex near the Mahalaxmi train station in Lower Parel. The woman was taking photographs of the area for a magazine story about Mumbai's chawls, tenements for workers employed in the mills. Lower Parel was the site of many textile mills until the 1980s, as manufacturing moved out of Mumbai. In more recent years, the area has undergone redevelopment and become a hub for media and advertising agencies, upscale restaurants and shopping malls. Several luxury apartment blocks are coming up in the area, but some abandoned mills remain. The police have released sketches of the five suspects, based on the woman's report. Officials at Jaslok Hospital confirmed that the woman had been admitted Thursday evening, but did not provide details. ''We are doing the needful,'' said Dr. Tarang Gianchandani, a senior hospital administrator told The Press Trust of India. ''She is under strict observation. At the moment we can't say anything.'' ''The case will be investigated very seriously,'' said R.R. Patil, the home minister of Maharashtra state, where Mumbai is located. Satyapal Singh, Police Commissioner, Mumbai said at a press conference in Mumbai Friday afternoon that one of the accused had been arrested and the police have identified the other four accused. The accused are believed to be between 20 and 25 years old and residents of Lower Parel, where the incident took place. The attack was reminiscent of the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old student last December in a bus in New Delhi. The woman and her male companion were attacked with iron rods, and the woman later died of her injuries. The incident caused public outrage across India. Protesters took to the streets demanding a safer environment for women and heavier penalties for sexual assault. In March, a new sexual offense law was passed imposing stricter punishments for violence against women and making activities such as stalking and voyeurism criminal offenses. Although Mumbai, India's financial capital, is widely considered one of India's safest cities, recent events have brought that into question. According to statistics released by the Praja Foundation, a non-profit organization in Mumbai, there were 207 cases of rape registered in the city in 2011-12, a 15 percent rise over the previous year.",2013,"India"
"227","Outside Mumbai, Reports of Rape Buried in Pages of Newspapers","Asia","It was a familiar scene in the lower house of the Indian Parliament on Monday as Sushma Swaraj, the Lok Sabha leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, demanded the death penalty for the five men who allegedly gang-raped a 22-year-old photojournalist in Mumbai last week while she was on assignment for an English-language magazine. A similar outcry ensued for weeks in the national legislature after a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was brutally violated by six men on a moving bus in December. She later died from the injuries. The gang rape sparked nationwide protests demanding better security for women, which forced the government to toughen laws on sexual violence. But little seems to have changed despite the new legislation. As the photojournalist recuperates in a Mumbai hospital and all the five suspects have been arrested, national attention continues to focus on the case. However, according to one media report, through an anonymous letter the victim's family has appealed for privacy. A paragraph in the letter reads: I have one small request to all of you. Please continue to respect the privacy of my daughter and me in this most trying time of our lives and give us the breathing space we so desperately need by not visiting our residence. We live in a society where such actions will only make it more difficult for us to get back to normal life. This can also impact my daughter's life and become an impediment in our struggle to regain our sanity and composure. The occurrence of a rape in Mumbai, which has for years been perceived as a relatively safer city for women in India, made it to the front pages of the nation's newspapers, but reports of sexual assault elsewhere in the country found scant attention last week, buried in a far less prominent spot in newsprint. A laborer allegedly raped his 3-year-old daughter in Jaipur in the northern state of Rajasthan on Wednesday and dumped her outside his house afterward, according to a Press Trust of India report in the Hindustan Times. Some passers-by spotted her and took her to a local hospital. The girl's mother, who was asleep when the rape took place, informed the police and had her husband arrested, the report said. In neighboring Haryana, a girl from Narwana village in Jind district told the police about a sexual assault by her college classmate two-and-a-half months back, a Press Trust of India report in Daily News and Analysis said on Saturday. In her complaint, she said that she took up the offer of being driven home by the suspect, who instead took her to his friend's house, where she said she was violated. The police have registered a case, the report said. A 25-year-old woman from Sangolda village in the western state of Goa, who had impaired hearing and a speech disability, died Saturday, six months after being raped, The Times of India reported. The local police registered a rape case on Saturday against an unknown person, the newspaper reported. In another case of sexual violence, the police said a 16-year-old tribal girl was raped and stabbed in the throat on Aug. 20 in the southeastern state of Orissa's Nayagarh district, according to a Press Trust of India report in Daily News and Analysis. The police said the assault took place at an isolated spot near a local police station in the Kandhamirigi village, where her family found her lying in a pool of blood. Her condition was critical, the report noted. As the number of reported sexual assault cases rises in India, what do you think should be done to make Indian cities safer for women?

"228","South Korean Ex-Aide Denies Improper Conduct on Trip","Asia","SEOUL, South Korea -- A spokesman for President Park Geun-hye who was fired while on a recent state visit to the United States denied Saturday that he had groped a young woman in a Washington hotel. The sudden dismissal of the spokesman, Yoon Chang-jung, 56, was followed by the widely reported accusations that he had grabbed the buttocks of a woman whom the South Korean government had hired as his guide. The allegation embarrassed Ms. Park, a new president who has been eager to present the visit as a total success and whom the political opposition has accused of filling important government posts with people whose ethical standards have been questioned. Although the South Korean government has not specified what act led to Mr. Yoon's dismissal, the South Korean news media have cited a Washington police report in which the woman accused Mr. Yoon of grabbing her buttocks without her permission. During a news conference in a Seoul restaurant, Mr. Yoon said Saturday that he had touched the back of the woman's waist lightly only once as a gesture of encouragement. The incident took place as he, the woman and his driver were leaving a Washington hotel bar after spending 30 minutes there together, Mr. Yoon said. He said he had invited her for drinks because he felt he had chastised the young woman too harshly for being a problematic guide. (He said he had angrily said several times, ''Who is the guide, you or me?'') ''Now I am deeply repentant for not properly understanding the American culture, and I offer my sincere word of consolation to the guide,'' Mr. Yoon said, facing a bank of television cameras. He also apologized to the South Korean people and to Ms. Park for causing ''trouble'' and putting a ''stain in the successful summit.'' Upon Ms. Park's return home on Friday after the five-day state visit, her chief press secretary, Lee Nam-ki, who was Mr. Yoon's immediate supervisor, issued an apology addressed both to the president and to the people, blaming Mr. Yoon for ''an indecent behavior.'' Mr. Lee said Mr. Yoon ''damaged the national prestige,'' but he did not elaborate. In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Yoon disputed a widely circulated accusation in the domestic news media in which he was said to have called the young woman into his hotel room while wearing only his underwear. He said Saturday that he was in his underwear when he rushed to a knock at the door the morning after the bar incident, expecting an urgent message. When he found the guide at the door, he said he turned her away. When the groping allegations first emerged, Mr. Yoon said his supervisor, Mr. Lee, told him to hurry home without giving him time to pack his belongings, even though Mr. Yoon had insisted on clearing his name while still in the United States. The South Korean government had been billing Ms. Park's Washington trip as an impeccable success, but the incident involving Mr. Yoon has cast a shadow over it. During the trip, Ms. Park met with President Obama on Tuesday and spoke before Congress the next day. The political opposition called on Ms. Park to apologize for Mr. Yoon's behavior, which it said humiliated the nation. Mr. Yoon had been Ms. Park's main spokesman since she was the president-elect. She won the presidency in December.",2013,"South Korea"
"229","Chinese Official Sentenced to 13 Years in Sex Scandal That Was Exposed on Internet","Asia","HONG KONG -- Lei Zhengfu, a Chinese official who became a symbol of corruption, was convicted of taking bribes and sentenced to 13 years in prison on Friday in a scandal that exposed the sordid deal-making in Communist Party politics. The conviction of Mr. Lei was the culmination of a fall that began when video images spread on the Internet in November showing him with an 18-year-old woman. The images, and ensuing accusations of graft and extortion, made him a much-mocked exhibit in the newly appointed Communist Party leadership's efforts to persuade citizens that it was stamping out official graft and depravity, which have stoked deepening public ire. Mr. Lei was sentenced days after President Xi Jinping made a new call to halt bureaucratic corruption and bribe-taking. A court in Chongqing, the municipality in southwest China where Mr. Lei once worked, dismissed his argument that a payoff of $488,000, or 3 million renminbi, he had arranged through an associate was a legitimate loan, not hush money to keep secret the video showing him with the young woman. The court said the money amounted to a bribe. ''The sums involved were massive, and the effects were malign,'' said the verdict read to Mr. Lei in the courtroom, according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. ''This should be sternly punished according to the law.'' China's leaders have vowed to get rid of corrupt officials, however low or high. Before his dismissal in November, Mr. Lei was the party secretary of Beibei, a district of Chongqing. Critics said the spectacle of his trial did not make up for Mr. Xi's failure thus far to take down senior officials, despite widespread speculation about corruption investigations in the government and the military involving powerful figures and large amounts of money. ''Lei Zhengfu was not a high-level official,'' Zhu Ruifeng, the muckraking blogger who first publicized the lurid images of Mr. Lei, said in a telephone interview from Beijing. ''I don't see much hope of the party and government really taking on corruption. ''Each generation of leaders vows to do that, but the results are plain to see. We don't hold much hope.'' The verdict drew avid interest from the Chinese news media and on Web sites. On Friday, another court in Chongqing convicted Xiao Ye, the businessman who had orchestrated the ''honey trap'' and threatened to expose video from 2008 that showed Mr. Lei, now 55, and the young woman having sex. Mr. Xiao was sentenced to 10 years in prison on extortion charges, and the woman, Zhao Hongxia, received a sentence of two years. On the Internet in China, some voiced wry sympathy for Mr. Lei. ''Lei Zhengfu was given a sentence of 13 years. He was in bed for 12 seconds, which makes one year for each second, with a year to spare,'' said one of many similar jests on Sina.com's Weibo, China's most popular equivalent of Twitter. After his sentence was announced, Mr. Lei did not say whether he would appeal, said Xinhua. China's party-run courts rarely decide in favor of defendants, especially in politically charged cases like this one, and appeals courts overturn guilty verdicts even less. Mr. Xi, who is the party chief, has started a ''rectification'' drive intended to clean up official ranks. During a recent meeting that lasted four days, he and other leaders denounced ''hedonism, extravagance'' and other bureaucratic sins, and took turns chastising themselves and others, state news media reported. ''Strictly manage your own families and personal staff,'' Mr. Xi said. ''Don't abuse power for selfish gain, don't seek special privileges.'' Mr. Lei was among the first of a succession of party officials whose misdeeds were exposed on the Internet, leading to their downfalls, after Mr. Xi became the party leader in November. The hunger for exposing wayward officials has encouraged an underground trade of extortionists who concoct pictures of lurid encounters. But Mr. Zhu, the blogger, said the party authorities in recent months have tightened restrictions on using the Internet to publicize accusations of corruption. ''At the time of the leadership handover, when we exposed Lei Zhengfu, the censorship was not so tough, but now it is again,'' Mr. Zhu said. ''Our working environment is worsening.''",2013,"China"
"230","Indian University Cancels American's Planned Talks","Asia","MUMBAI -- Amina Wadud, an American scholar who has spoken widely on women's role in Islam, has said that lectures she was scheduled to give last week to students and faculty at the University of Madras, in Chennai, were canceled after the organizer said the police were concerned about maintaining law and order. Dr. Wadud said on Thursday in a telephone interview from the southern Indian city of Kozhikode, where she is staying, that P.K. Abdul Rahiman, an assistant professor at the university's Center for Islamic Studies, the event's organizer, had told her that ''some development'' with the police would prevent the lectures. Mr. Rahiman confirmed that the police had contacted him to say they were ''anticipating a law and order problem'' if Dr. Wadud spoke. Mr. Rahiman said he had subsequently received a text message from the authorities saying that the ''police can not allow this considering law and order. Plz take action to suspend/cancel the program.'' The police said a previous appearance by Dr. Wadud had led to an ''incident'' in Tamil Nadu, the state where the university is located, though Dr. Wadud said she had not visited the area before. R. Thandavan, the university's vice chancellor, dismissed allegations that the lectures had been canceled over fears of protests, as was reported in the local news media. He said the university authorities initially had ''no knowledge'' of the lectures until the police inquired about Dr. Wadud's tourist visa. Defending his decision to cancel the lectures, he said the Center for Islamic Studies did not obtain his approval prior to inviting a ''foreign national to the university.'' Dr. Wadud, an authority on the Koran and gender within Islam, is a retired Virginia Commonwealth University professor who has lectured around the world. She made headlines in 2005 for leading a Muslim prayer service for men and women at a New York City church after she could not find a mosque willing to accommodate a mixed-gender event. ''I'm feeling a little disappointed as to why is it that I am seeming to create a problem,'' Dr. Wadud said of the canceled lectures. ''I have spent 10 months in India and have been invited to give talks at other universities. There's been no problem.''",2013,"India"
"231","Photographer Is Raped By Five Men In Mumbai","Asia","A female photographer with an English language magazine was raped by five men in Mumbai Thursday evening, undercutting Mumbai's image as the rare Indian city where women can safely move about in public spaces. The assault echoed the gang rape and murder of a woman in New Delhi in December, which set off an unprecedented wave of protests. The woman, 22, arrived at the abandoned, desolate compound of Shakti Mills, a defunct textile factory, around 6 p.m., accompanied by a male colleague. She was taking photographs of the area, now a trendy hub for media and advertising companies, for a magazine article about Mumbai's chawls, or tenements for workers who were once employed in the mills. Under Indian law, the authorities are not permitted to release the name of a rape victim or, in this case, the name of her employer. The authorities said that five men accosted and assaulted the two journalists inside the compound. The male journalist was tied up and beaten before the young woman was raped. ''There were five men in total, though it is as yet unclear whether they were all involved in raping the girl,'' Satyapal Singh, the Mumbai police commissioner, said. ''They tied the hands of her colleague using a belt and they hit him with a belt, but he was not severely injured.'' Doctors at Jaslok Hospital, where the woman was brought on Thursday evening, said that she had suffered external and internal injuries but that she was expected to make a full recovery. ''As of now, she is stable and Jaslok Hospital is doing its best,'' Dr. Tarang Gianchandani, a hospital administrator, said in a statement. On Friday morning, in an unusually rapid response, the Mumbai police arrested one of the five attackers, and the police said they had identified the others. ''One of the five has been arrested and he admitted he was there along with some others,'' Mr. Singh said at a news conference Friday afternoon. The police have released sketches of the five men, based on the woman's report. The five attackers are in their early 20s and live in an area near the abandoned textile mill, Mr. Singh said. Two of them have criminal records, he said. The police have not released their names. After the December attack, in which a physiotherapy student was gang-raped and beaten to death and her male friend severely beaten, tens of thousands protested for weeks, demanding a safer environment for women and heavier penalties for sexual assault. In March, India revised its colonial-era laws on sexual assault, imposing heavier punishments for violence against women and designating stalking and voyeurism as criminal offenses. Under the new laws, the suspects will be subject to a minimum punishment of 20 years and a maximum of life imprisonment, if convicted. While Mumbai, India's financial capital, is widely considered one of the country's safest cities, recent events have brought that into question. According to statistics from the Praja Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Mumbai, 207 rape cases were registered in the city in 2011 and 2012, a 15 percent increase over 2010. The number of reported rapes nationwide is widely believed to be much lower than the actual number. The assault on the journalist in Mumbai has not brought protesters to the streets, but it triggered outrage and intense anger in the Indian news media. On Friday afternoon, about 50 journalists held a silent protest in Hutatuma Square at the heart of Mumbai's financial district. On Friday, R.R. Patil, the home minister of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, told the Indian news media that female journalists reporting from isolated areas would be provided police protection, an idea that did not go over well with some. ''As a journalist, I should have the freedom to report from where I want, at par with my male colleagues,'' Deepti Sachdeva, a reporter with the Times Now television network, posted on Twitter. Gurbir Singh, an editor at BusinessWorld magazine, accused the Mumbai police of failing to clean up abandoned buildings and prevent them from becoming safe houses for criminals. ''The mill in question had been lying abandoned for some years and had become a center for drug abuse, the sale of illicit liquor and all sorts of criminal activities, and the police were aware of this,'' Mr. Singh said. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",2013,"India"
"232","Rape Trial Casts Spotlight on Offspring of China's Elite","Asia","HONG KONG -- A gang-rape trial that opened in Beijing on Wednesday accompanied by a blaze of local media attention has become China's latest legal spectacle to cast attention on the lifestyles, and alleged misdeeds, of the political elite. One of the five defendants is Li Tianyi, a 17-year-old whose privileged background and past misdeeds have made him the focus of a media and Internet uproar about what many see as the sordid ways of the offspring of the political elite. Mr. Li is the son of celebrity singers for the People's Liberation Army and ran into legal trouble before the rape charges. The prosecutors allege that the defendants -- Mr. Li, three other minors and a 23-year-old man -- took a young woman they had met in a bar in February to a hotel room in Beijing, beat her, forced her to strip and sexually assaulted her, according to a report on the Web site of the newspaper People's Daily. Like the recent trial of Bo Xilai, the fallen former politician, the case has become an intensely watched and debated parable about the privileges and limited accountability of the Communist Party's highborn. And accusations against the woman who says she was raped have stirred discussion about how the Chinese media and courts deal with victims of sexual assault and minors accused of crimes. ''The factor behind why the media and everyone is so interested in this case is that it's about the so-called ugly officials and ugly rich,'' said Lu Pin, who helps run the Media Monitor for Women Network, an advocacy group in Beijing. ''Everyone wants to see them exposed in disgrace, because in the majority of cases nothing is ever revealed,'' Ms. Lu said in a telephone interview. ''But in fact, opinion can also easily be turned so that this becomes a trial of the victim.'' Chinese news Web sites have devoted special subsites to the case, and they showed pictures of journalists jammed behind police cordons outside the courthouse on Wednesday, although the trial is closed to the public. The defendants, including Mr. Li, answered questions in court about the charges, the official news agency, Xinhua, reported. Mr. Li denied that he had beaten or had had sex with the woman, according to the Web site of The Beijing News. But he also said he was too drunk to know anything, the report said. The trial will continue on Thursday; Chinese courts usually give verdicts about two weeks after a trial ends. But for Mr. Li's high profile, the case probably would never have ignited the uproar. His father, Li Shuangjiang, is a highly ranked People's Liberation Army singer -- sometimes, mistakenly, called a general in Chinese news reports -- famed for his rousing odes to the party, patriotism and military virtues. The suspect's mother, Meng Ge, is also a well-known military singer. The cherub-faced Mr. Li was also dabbling with a musical career, but he won notoriety in 2011, when a BMW he was driving hit another car. He and another teenager stepped out and beat and threatened the couple in the other car. The police later sent him to a labor camp for juvenile offenders, and since then his struggles have been chronicled in the Chinese media much as American entertainment news outlets track the wayward children of Hollywood stars. ''This case caters to the Chinese people's hatred of officials, the wealthy, and celebrities,'' Chen Youxi, a prominent Chinese lawyer, said in an interview with Phoenix television, a broadcaster based in Hong Kong. ''Any incident that involves a famous person, a wealthy person or a princeling, public opinion will be naturally inclined to hate them, to attack them.'' China's courts are run by the Communist Party, but both sides in the case have sought to recruit public opinion to shore up their cases. Ms. Meng accused the manager of the bar where her son met the woman of running a prostitution ring and trying to blackmail her family. A law professor in Beijing suggested that the victim was a prostitute, asserting that she had endured less harm than a ''chaste'' woman. News reports have said the victim worked as a secretary. The professor later withdrew the comments and apologized. Ms. Lu, the women's rights advocate, said the notion that a sex worker was entitled to less protection showed the pressures that women encounter when they file sexual assault charges. ''Behind this is the fact that views about sex in China are particularly unfair to women,'' Ms. Lu said. ''If you're a victim and you want to use public opinion to defend your rights, you pay the price through having your moral reputation being torn apart.''",2013,"China"
"233","Third Suspect Arrested in the Mumbai Gang Rape","Asia","Updated, 10:34 p.m. | MUMBAI- The Mumbai police said Saturday evening that they had arrested a third suspect in the gang rape of a photojournalist who was attacked this week while on assignment. ""The third accused, Siraj Rehman Khan, was arrested a few hours ago and has been taken into police custody,"" said Madhukar Chaudhury, assistant police inspector at the N.M. Joshi Marg police station in the Lower Parel neighborhood of Mumbai, where the case was registered on Thursday evening. The photojournalist, a 22-year-old woman, was assaulted by five men on Thursday night in Shakti Mills, an abandoned textile mill compound in Lower Parel, where she was taking photographs for an English-language magazine.  A male colleague who had accompanied her was tied up and beaten, according to police reports. The attack, which echoed the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in New Delhi in December, has sparked protests and outrage in the Indian press. Early Saturday morning the Mumbai police had made the second arrest in the case. Vijay Jadhav, 19, was arrested from the Madanpura area of the city said a Mumbai police officer, Vinod Singh. The victim is being treated at Jaslok Hospital, where doctors said Friday night that she had suffered internal and external injuries but was now in stable condition. On Friday, the Mumbai police arrested one of the five suspects and said that they had identified the others based on the young woman's testimony. According to reports in The Times of India, the man arrested on Friday was identified as Chand Babu Sattat Shaikh, alias Mohammed Abdul, who was described as an unemployed 19-year-old. He was reported to have confessed to the crime and named the other men involved. The Mumbai police said more than 20 teams were searching the city for the remaining suspects. ""The probe is heading in the right direction and we hope to arrest all other absconding accused soon,"" said Satyapal Singh, the Mumbai police commissioner, at a press conference in Mumbai on Saturday. He had said a day before that two of the five suspects had criminal records. The Hindustan Times reported that the five accused were all unemployed men who frequented the mill area.  Speaking to the Indian television channel IBNLive, a grandmother of one of the suspects claimed that her grandson, who is a minor, was not present at the time of the assault. The incident has reignited debate in Parliament over violence against women in India. ""This country cannot afford to have our women and children insecure in the hands of those who attack them,"" Law Minister Kapil Sibal told reporters on Friday.",2013,"India"
"234","Death Sentences Set In Gang Rape That Shook India","Asia","NEW DELHI -- There was no mistaking the whoop of joy that rose outside Saket District Court on Friday, when word got out that four men convicted in last December's horrific gang rape and murder had been sentenced to death by hanging. People burst into applause. They hugged whoever was beside them. They pumped the air with their fists. ''We are the winners now,'' said a woman holding a placard. Sweat had dried into white rivulets on her face, but she had the look of a woman who had, finally, gotten what she wanted. And it was true: A wave of protests after the December rape have set remarkable changes in motion in India, a country where for decades vicious sexual harassment has been dismissed indulgently, called ''eve-teasing.'' But some of India's most ardent women's rights advocates hung back from Friday's celebration, skeptical that four hangings would do anything to stem violence against women, a problem whose proportions are gradually coming into focus. ''I think a lot of people were hugging each other because they thought this evil is localized, and it will be wiped out, and that is not the case,'' said Karuna Nundy, a litigator who has argued before India's Supreme Court. ''The sad truth is that it is not a deterrent.'' From the moment it broke, the story of the 23-year-old woman who became known as ''Nirbhaya,'' or ''fearless,'' awoke real rage in the population. Hoping for a ride home from a movie theater, she and a male companion boarded a private bus, not realizing that the six men aboard had been cruising Delhi in search of a victim. After knocking her friend unconscious, they took her to the back of the bus and raped her, then penetrated her with a metal rod, inflicting grave internal injuries. An hour later, they dumped the pair out on the road, bleeding and naked. She died two weeks later of her injuries. Young men and women, mobilized through social media, joined protests that spread across India, demanding tougher laws and more effective policing. ''As a woman, and mother, I understand how protesters feel,'' Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful female politician and the president of the governing Congress Party, said at the time. ''Today we pledge that the victim will get justice.'' After intensive public discussion of the case, some changes followed with extraordinary speed. Reports of rape have skyrocketed; in the first eight months of this year, Delhi's police force registered 1,121 cases, more than double the number from the same period in 2011 and the highest number since 2000. The number of reported molestations has increased sixfold in the same period. The government created a fast-track court for rape cases and introduced new laws, criminalizing acts like voyeurism and stalking and making especially brutal rapes into a capital crime. Scholars have delved into the social changes that may be contributing to the problem, as new arrivals in India's huge cities find themselves unemployed and hopeless, stuck in ''the space below the working class,'' as the writer Rajrishi Singhal recently put it in an editorial in The Hindu. But many were thinking of something more basic -- punishing the six (one, a juvenile, got a three-year sentence in August, and the driver was found dead in his cell in March) who attacked the woman in the bus. It was those people who found their way to the Saket courthouse on Friday. Many came like pilgrims, hoping to find closure in a case that had haunted them. Kiran Khullar arrived in a wheelchair, accompanied by her daughter, 17. ''I have come here as a mother,'' she said. ''I came here only to see these men get the death penalty.'' A 62-year-old grandmother, Arun Puri, had scribbled the words ''Hang them! Hang them!'' on her dupatta, a traditional scarf. Asked whether she felt sorry for the defendants' parents, she did not flinch. ''If these men were my children,'' she said, ''I would have strangled them to death myself.'' Rosy John, 62, a homemaker watching the furor outside the courtroom, said her only objection to the death sentence was that it was too humane a punishment. ''After death, they will get freedom,'' she said. ''They should be tortured and given shocks their whole life.'' In fact, it is unlikely the four men will be executed swiftly. The order must be confirmed by India's High Court, and all four defendants may appeal to the High Court, the Supreme Court and the president for clemency. Some 477 people are on death row, inching through a process that often drags on for five or six years. Three people have been executed since 2004, and there were no executions for eight years before that. Sadashiv Gupta, who defended one of the men, a fruit seller named Pawan Gupta, said he had assured his client that the sentence was likely to be commuted to life in prison, as most are. ''I told him: 'You are going to get the death penalty. Take it in stride, and don't panic,' '' said Mr. Gupta, sweating in his stiff white collar outside the courthouse. ''I think he shall not be hanged.'' Polls show that Indians remain ambivalent about using the death penalty, with 40 percent saying it should be abolished, according to a survey by CNN, IBN and The Hindu, a respected daily newspaper. For many months already, advocates for women have questioned whether death sentences in the December case would distract people from the more difficult question of why Indian girls and women are so vulnerable to sexual violence. ''A base but very human part of me would like them to suffer as much as they made that woman suffer,'' wrote Nilanjana S. Roy in The Hindu, noting that most rapists are not strangers. She went on to envision the result if convicted rapists were hanged consistently for a year: 10,000 neighbors, shopkeepers, tutors, grandfathers, fathers and brothers. ''I wish I could believe that this sort of mass public execution -- if we agreed that this was the way forward -- would do more than slake our collective need for vengeance,'' Ms. Roy wrote. ''But I don't believe in fairy tales.'' Ms. Nundy, the Supreme Court litigator, said the real challenge lies in shaking up the criminal justice system, which is desperately short of judges and mired in outdated thinking about violence against women. Upon receiving a report of rape, she said, police investigators still routinely use a ''two-finger test'' to determine whether the victim has a prior sexual history; if the answer is yes, she said, the likelihood of a conviction plummets. ''Rape is not just something that is localized -- you find these people, you wipe them out, you're done,'' she said. Still, there were some people whose satisfaction on Friday could not be punctured. Among them was Gaurav Singh, 20, a brother of the victim in the December gang rape. She was the firstborn and the star of the family, which had left a village of thatched-roof huts for the dizzying sprawl of Delhi, 600 miles away. To pay for her tuition, her father had sold most of his land in the village, borrowed money from family members and worked 16-hour shifts handling luggage at the airport. She had promised to return the favor by paying for her younger brothers' schooling once she became a physiotherapist. Mr. Singh, who plans to become a pilot, pondered the question of mercy on Friday night. ''They never gave my sister a chance,'' he said in a telephone interview. He noted that she had managed to make her own wishes known, telling a court official, who visited her in a hospital before she died, that her assailants should be ''burned alive.'' He said the family would wait for the day they are hanged, and, in the meantime, ''keep the fight going that my sister has ignited.'' ''We know she can't come back,'' he said. ''But there is a satisfaction that these men will be eliminated. We get some peace from that.''",2013,"India"
"235","Violence Against Women in India","Asia","The conviction on Tuesday of four men for the brutal rape and murder of a 23-year-old student late last year in Delhi shows that there is no reason justice cannot be delivered swiftly in India, a country where most legal cases drag on for years. Unfortunately, the case also demonstrates that it takes thousands of people protesting in the streets to put enough pressure on Indian lawmakers to get the wheels of justice moving. As the world's largest democracy, India is filled with potential but it also suffers many political and economic handicaps, as we wrote in an editorial on Monday. One of the more important challenges facing the country is ensuring the safety of its citizens, particularly its women. India's police are notoriously corrupt, underpaid and poorly trained. There are far too few courts, judges and lawyers to serve the needs of the country's 1.2 billion people. In a speech earlier this year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the country has a backlog of 30 million legal cases and 26 percent of them had been pending for more than 5 years. Those numbers, of course, do not account for crimes that never get to court because the police are reluctant to file new cases or investigate those that are registered. Some activists and family members of the 23-year-old physiotherapy student killed in the Delhi rape have been arguing that nothing less a death sentence for the four convicted men will satisfy them. (A fifth defendant was found dead in his jail cell in March and a sixth was sentenced to three years in juvenile court last month.) The death penalty may seem an appealing end to this case on an emotional level but it will serve no purpose other than to perpetuate violence. It would be a far greater tribute to the memory of the student, who cannot be named because Indian law forbids the identification of rape victims, if Indian society finally got on with the difficult work of making the country safe for its women, and its police and judicial system function for all of its people. Sadly, there has been no shortage of examples of heinous crimes against women since the Delhi rape. Last month, a photojournalist was assaulted and raped by a gang of men in Mumbai, the country's financial capital that many Indians consider to be a much safer city for women than Delhi. ""It is a crime to be born as a woman in India. You always live in fear as anything can happen to you at any time,"" a 27-year-old female police officer who was raped three weeks ago in eastern India as she took the body of her sister to be cremated, told Bloomberg News recently.",2013,"India"
"236","India's Politicians Ignore Women Voters in Election Campaigns","Asia","On the eve of Diwali, I was walking around the inner circle of Connaught Place, a well-known shopping center in Delhi, with a journalist friend. The business arcade teemed with people. Suddenly loud, belligerent voices tore through the festive air. We stopped. Two angry middle-aged women were seeking the help of a policeman and accusing two men hovering around them of making lewd remarks. ""He called me a whore,"" said one of them, pointing her fingers at one of the men. The accused man raised his hand to hit her. A curious crowd gathered. The police officers, all men, did nothing to help the women. And then I saw one police officer pull at the clothes of one of those women and yell at her: ""I will slap you!."" We walked through the crowd to the police officer and identified ourselves as journalists. He seemed taken aback by our sudden arrival. It didn't bother the two men who had been accused of sexual harassment. As we argued with the police officer about his failure to act, the crowd gradually dispersed and the women walked away. Two men who had happily joined the original harassers muttered about ""women's power"" crossing all limits these days. The incident evokes the everyday violence that defines the lives of women in Indian cities. According to data compiled by the Delhi Police, over 1,000 rape cases have been reported in the capital this year through mid-August, more than double than what was reported in the same period last year, while molestation has gone up by nearly four times during the same period. But despite the routine gender violence, India's political leaders are conspicuously silent on the subject of violence against women as they gear up for the national elections in 2014. Last December, the gang rape and subsequent death of a 23-year-old student in Delhi had spontaneously drawn thousands out on the streets of the Indian capital - women and men, young and old. The visibility of last year's protests against sexual violence were expected to affect political attitudes in India, but as Indian politicians campaign feverishly, they have once again successfully tuned out the question of women's rights. The political class has always studiously ignored women's concerns, even when it has to do with an important subject like safety in public spaces. Yet one would expect a different electoral imagination for the 2014 elections because of their extraordinary backdrop. A combination of street protests and detailed coverage by the Indian media have pushed two topics to the top of the public discourse: corruption and gender violence. The governing Congress Party finds its credibility in tatters because of a succession of scandals, which began with the revelations of corruption in the organization of the Commonwealth Games in 2010, followed by allegations of graft in the allocation of wireless spectrum to telephone companies and accusations that the government underpriced coal blocks awarded to private companies. The scams generated reams of news and scalded the Congress Party and the United Progressive Alliance, the governing coalition it leads. As the news reports of corruption within the Congress Party-led government continued, India seethed with anger. The spontaneous anticorruption movement led by the Gandhian activist Anna Hazare in 2011 changed the political conversation in India. The recent formation of the Aam Admi Party, led by Arvind Kejriwal, a former civil servant who was the most influential aide of Mr. Hazare's before they parted ways, has introduced the possibilities of an alternative politics in India as the new party is making its electoral debut in Delhi's local government elections later in the month. The anticorruption upsurge has been a success in that the politicians and governments facing charges of corruption are now finding it increasingly difficult to evade the law. Recently, Lalu Prasad, the former chief minister of Bihar, was convicted of siphoning funds and was sentenced to five years in prison. But despite the mass protests last December, gender and women's issues remain absent from the daily discussions of politics. The rhetoric of machismo underpinning the ongoing election campaigns might offer an explanation for this silence. The protagonists of India's two national parties - Rahul Gandhi of the Congress Party, the heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, and Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the chief minister of Gujarat - are squaring up against each other. The theatrical speeches delivered by Mr. Modi and Mr. Gandhi are laced with an overdose of machismo. Their failure to mention, let alone dwell on women's security, throws into sharp relief the masculinity on which Indian mainstream politics rests. This manifests itself in both speakers' body language, their gesticulating hands, wild swaggers and frequent rolling up of sleeves. Customarily, Mr. Modi is associated with macho theatrics and political chutzpah. He is known to articulate a rugged political power that has aided him in steamrolling dissent within his own party and critics outside it. Mr. Modi likes to stare his opponents down and fling cutting remarks at them. His relentless advocacy of putting Pakistan in its place at every provocation that comes India's way further enhances this masculine image. Mr. Gandhi was seen as the reluctant torchbearer of the battered Congress Party and no match for Mr. Modi's display of masculine valor. Mr. Gandhi came across as diffident and low-key, and was written off by Indian political pundits for his lack of oratorical skillls and aggression. The constant lament about Mr. Gandhi's subdued campaign has of late nudged him into embracing the aggressive finger-wagging, rostrum thumping of his male competitors and colleagues. The reluctance or indifference of Indian politicians to speak about the violence against women illustrates the misogyny that binds India' political class. India's politicians irrespective of political and ideological affiliations casually pepper their speech with sexist remarks. Not so long ago, Mr. Modi, had ""joked"" that the Congress Party president, Sonia Gandhi, who is also Mr. Gandhi's mother, does not know ""how to run a kitchen."" He also threw barbs at Shashi Tharoor, a federal minister, for having a ""50 crore [500 million] rupee girlfriend,"" referring to Mr. Tharoor's wife, Sunanda Pushkar, who was once accused of gaining a lucrative stake in a cricket team while she was dating Mr. Tharoor.  Mr. Modi had claimed that Ms. Pushkar had 50 crore rupees [500 million] deposited in her bank account a month before she married Mr. Tharoor and seemed to signal that Mr. Tharoor used his official position to get her the lucrative cricket deal. In support of Mr. Modi, the B.J.P.'s spokesman, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, said, ""For an international love guru like Tharoor, a ministry of love affairs should be created."" On the other side of the divide, Sriprakash Jaiswal of the Congress Party, the coal minister, commented that ""wives lose charm over time"" as they become old. His colleague in government, Sushilkumar Shinde, the home affairs minister, casually dismissed Jaya Bachchan, an actor who is a member of the upper house of the Indian Parliament, when she intervened in a parliamentary discussion on sectarian violence in the northeastern state of Assam in 2012. ""It is a serious matter and not the subject of a film,"" Mr. Shinde told Ms. Bachchan. It is precisely this attitude that has prevented the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill, which gives women a 33 percent quota in the Indian Parliament and state assemblies - for over a decade. Indian politicians fundamentally believe in the mythical idea of ""vote banks"" - specific sections of the population that will garner electoral votes - and pander to what they perceive to be their interests. Unfortunately, women are not considered a ""vote bank"" and are therefore free to be abused both physically and through words.

"237","Newsmagazine's Handling of Sex Harassment Complaint Draws Criticism","Asia","NEW DELHI - The newsmagazine Tehelka has made a name for itself through its aggressive investigative journalism, going after corrupt politicians and other lawbreakers. On Thursday, however, the publication was the one on the defensive after the editor in chief stepped down temporarily over a sexual harassment complaint by a staffer. According to a report by DNA, a female reporter sent an email to the managing editor, Shoma Chaudhury, accusing the editor in chief, Tarun Tejpal, of sexually assaulting her during an event in Goa organized by Tehelka earlier this month. The reporter was not immediately available for comment. According to a leaked copy of an email that Mr. Tejpal sent to Ms. Chaudhury on Wednesday night, Mr. Tejpal informed her that he would leave the newsweekly for six months because of his ""misconduct."" ""A bad lapse of judgment, an awful misreading of the situation, have led to an unfortunate incident that rails against all we believe in and fight for,"" he wrote. Ms. Chaudhury circulated his email to Tehelka staff and deemed the situation an ""untoward incident,"" imploring them to ""stand by the institution."" Her email was also leaked to the public. Women's rights activists and other journalists in Delhi, however, expressed outrage that a major media organization was treating the complaint as merely an internal matter. Speaking to NDTV, Ms. Chaudhury said Thursday that she would address the issues that have been raised in time. ""I am from the fraternity, I understand the need for transparency, but I do need the time to act correctly on it,"" she said.  ""I will falter, the institution will falter if you put this amount of pressure to get an immediate reaction on it."" Ms. Chaudhury did not respond to an email from India Ink requesting comment. The prosecution of sexual harassment at the workplace remains something of a gray area in India -difficult to combat legally, with cultural impediments in place against women complaining. The question remains whether it should be up to an institution to prosecute it internally, leading to the possibility of bias and protectionism, or whether it should be prosecuted independently, under the penal code. For years, the Vishaka Guidelines, laid down in 1997 by the Supreme Court pending legislation, were specifically set up to deal with sexual harassment at work. They were drafted to tackle sexual harassment in the workplace before it began, and stipulated that complaints committees with at least one member independent of the institution were set up to investigate harassment cases. Many companies, including Tehelka, have yet to set up these committees, a fact that one author of the guidelines blames on lackluster enforcement. ""The government really dropped the ball - they didn't seek compliance,"" said Naina Kapur, a lawyer and women's rights activist who helped to draft the guidelines. ""The government has a larger power base.  Had they done the prevention, we would have had a different world."" This year, sexual harassment was included in the Indian penal code under section 354(A). In April, the Sexual Harassment of Women in the Workplace Act was passed to deal with complaints in civil court, both compelled into action partially because of the changed environment after the Delhi gang rape case in December 2012. These two changes made it much easier for sexual harassment complaints to be tackled outside of the institution, but legal experts say that evidence makes it difficult to criminally prosecute sexual harassment in the workplace, even if the complainant cooperates. ""They can be parallel processes,"" said Vrinda Grover, a human rights lawyer and advocate for women's issues. ""They can be internal and external. ""In the Tehelka matter it appears to be a serious incident of sexual assault. I would leave that decision provided the institution gives absolute and unconditional support to the woman concerned. If she wished to go to police, we should support her. If she doesn't, let that be her decision."" Others contend that media companies in particular are at fault, covering gender progressively on one hand and ignoring cases of sexual harassment inside their own houses on the other. A member of the Network of Women in Media in India, Neha Dixit, who is a freelance journalist and a contributor to India Ink, signed an open letter demanding that media houses including Tehelka set up complaints committees. She said that her own complaint of sexual harassment at Tehelka when she was a staffer in 2008 went largely ignored as well. ""With all the feminist writing that we do, I think what is becoming a problem is that it's becoming a reverse trajectory - some girl raising a complaint of sexual harassment is tapped as uncool, regressive and not being able to deal with flirtatious behavior,"" she said. She said she did not pursue a criminal complaint because she felt she lacked the resources or the family support to do so. Some say that the nature of the criminal justice system in India and the attitudes of some police act as a deterrent to filing a complaint, which is why it is important for a company to have internal mechanism to deal with sexual harassment. ""The whole idea of Vishaka was that women don't want to go to police station; they want to go to their workplace and complain there,"" said Ms. Kapur.  ""I'm not a fan of criminal law.  I don't think it changes systems.  I think it punishes people, but it doesn't change systems.  And that should be the goal of law.""

"238","China to End Loophole in Child Rape Law, Experts Say","Asia","For 16 years, children's rights advocates have called on the Chinese government to do away with a law that allows men who have sex with girls under 14 years of age, the legal age of consent, to receive a more lenient punishment than those convicted of raping older girls or women if they can ""prove"" that the child was paid or otherwise compensated for sex. The crime of ""spending the night in a brothel with a young girl"" provides an incentive for sexual predators to choose younger girls in order to evade the heaviest sentences, critics say. Men accused of raping a child could bribe or force the girl or her family to testify that she had been paid. The law also stigmatizes the girls by labeling them as prostitutes, activists say. The Chinese Supreme Court has indicated to a leading proponent of changing the law, National People's Congress deputy Sun Xiaomei, that it accepts the argument that the law, which has been on the books since 1997, is unfair and wrong. While no date has been set for the legal change, child rights activists and feminists are jubilant. ""It's a really, really positive change,"" said Zhang Rongli, a law professor at the China Women's University. ""And it's an example of the government listening to public opinion. This law was very unpopular throughout society. Surveys showed that 98 or 99 percent of people opposed it. The government listened."" ""While we have to wait for the change to become law, and the Supreme Court can't legislate, only the National People's Congress can, we've been told that it is already effectively over,"" Ms. Zhang said. Word of the decision spread last Saturday at a conference on child rights attended by activists, academics and reporters, she said. For years, Ms. Sun, a university colleague of Ms. Zhang, had pushed in the National People's Congress for the law to be changed, as had many others. Last July Ms. Sun received the first indication from officials that they would do so, said Ms. Zhang. On Monday, Beijing Youth Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, cited unnamed officials in the Supreme Court as saying it ""completely agreed"" that the law should be expunged. The main reason they gave was that ""while the crime of 'spending the night with a young girl in a brothel' did punish the man, it also gave the girl a shameful label,"" the newspaper said. The discrepancy in penalties depending on payment was also a problem, said Ms. Zhang. As was the fact that the law set no ""lower limit"" for age, applying to children from birth to 14. ""It was awful,"" she said. The penalty for rape in China can include life in jail and execution, whereas the penalty for ""spending a night with a young girl in a brothel is capped at 15 years. ""Of course, it's not at all the same thing if you can't get life or execution,"" said Ms. Zhang.",2013,"China"
"239","Are Women Any Safer in India?","Asia","NEW DELHI - Though nationwide protests following the gang rape of a woman in Delhi and stronger laws enacted this year have raised the public's awareness of sexual assaults on women, Sonia, 26, said nothing has changed in the way the men have treated her as she uses public transport for her work in medical equipment sales. Since she came to Delhi in 2008, men have constantly ogled her, made lewd remarks and groped her while she travels on the city's packed buses. ""One man presses from the back and the other from the front,"" said Sonia, who asked that her full name not be used so that her family doesn't worry about her safety. Protesting is pointless because the men claim that there is no space, she said. ""But you can tell by how they lean or brush against you that they are just sick,"" she said. ""Even their staring is sick, and they especially look at girls wearing even a bit of tight clothes."" One year later after the gang rape in Delhi, the question being raised is whether women are any safer in the nation's capital. India Ink posed it to human rights lawyers, activists and residents of Delhi, who all say it's an impossible question or too early to say. But they agree that key milestones were reached this year, which include expanding the definitions of sexual crimes, increasing jail time for offenders, punishing police officials who fail to register complainants. The most important development, they said, was the unprecedented wave of concern and public conversations over how to combat sexual violence. ""We are in a moment of a huge change and deep shift in conciseness in our thinking of violence against women,"" said Farah Naqvi, a prominent women's rights activist. ""There has never been public discourse before, and more women are being empowered to come and register complaints."" The sexual harassment previously borne silently by millions of women, and hidden or ignored by their families, is now dinnertime conversations in households across the country. Since the gang rape last year, women in Delhi who feel threatened are calling a new hotline to seek help, while many have signed up for self-defense training. Instead of fizzling out, women's safety became an election issue for the first time this year in the Delhi assembly elections. There is also a move to change the tenor of these public conversations, which are well intentioned but still imply shame or guilt on the part of the victim. This perception is on display in the photos and drawings of women hiding their faces in their hands, or behind a mop of hair that accompany news stories about sexual assault. Delinking rape with dishonor is leading more women to speak out against their perpetrators, even if they are powerful men, said Ms. Naqvi. ""The taint of shame is slowly shifting from women to the state that fails to protect and the society that tolerates violence against women,"" she said. In a few high-profile examples, like the one involving Tarun Tejpal, the influential editor of the magazine Tehelka who is accused of assaulting a staffer, and the gang rape of a journalist in Mumbai, the police have moved quickly to arrest and charge suspects, a marked change in how such cases were handled before the Dec. 16, 2012, gang rape. Many have been astounded to find affluent and well-connected men ending up in jail cells within days of the accusations being made, like the self-styled godman Asaram Bapu, which was unlikely to happen before Dec. 16, 2012. But for now the police and courts remain under intense media and public pressure to act. In some cases, however, human rights activists criticize efforts to prosecute sexual crimes as inadequate. For example, they are irate that a former Supreme Court judge, A.K. Ganguly, 72, has not been prosecuted for sexual harassment even though a three-member judicial panel said in its preliminary findings that he had shown ""unwelcome behavior"" toward a female law intern at a hotel last year. The Supreme Court's chief justice ruled out any further action by the court since Mr. Ganguly had already retired by the time the law intern encountered Mr. Ganguly. Mr. Ganguly, who denies the accusation, is also resisting calls for his resignation as head of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission. ""There is no greater affront to women's dignity that a man indicted of sexual harassment continues to hold public place,"" said Vrinda Grover, a prominent human rights lawyer in Delhi. In addition, those who are charged with rape often have a good chance of staying out of prison. In 2012, the conviction rate for rape in India was less than 25 percent. In Delhi, out of the 754 men arrested on rape charges last year, only one was convicted while the rest were facing pending investigations or trials. But the biggest challenge, Indira Jaising, additional solicitor general, told India Ink, was changing the patriarchal and chauvinistic mindset of judges, legislators and police officials who see verbal harassment as just a bit of fun and dismiss stalking as ""boys will be boys."" Although the penalties for sexual assault have been strengthened as a deterrent, the women who live in the capital don't feel any safer, as horrifying accounts of rapes continue to pour in from the capital and outside. Last week, a teenage girl reported she was raped by four men and dumped in a parking lot of Connaught Place market in upscale central Delhi. Last month, a 2-year-old Afghan girl was reported to have been raped inside her home in south Delhi. Government data shows that 1,493 cases of rape were recorded in the capital this year until November, as compared to 706 cases for all of 2012. The number of molestation cases jumped from 625 last year to 3,237 until November this year. The Delhi police have said the growing number of registered complaints isn't necessarily proof of an actual rise in crime, but instead points to an increased willingness on the part of women to report these crimes. Though the data doesn't demonstrate an increase in sexual assaults, women perceive the capital as being more dangerous, based on their personal experiences. Sonia, for instance, said, ""For the past six years, I feel the behavior of men has gone from bad to worse. One used to hear one cheap comment a day, but now it's four a day."" At the heart of sexual violence is sexism and gender inequality, say human rights activists. Rooting out such entrenched patriarchal norms in Indian society will take generations, they say, but it's a task that must start now. However, they worry that the central government has no fresh ideas after enacting the law earlier this year and lacks of any kind of roadmap to plan and implement such an ambitious overhaul of society. ""We are not having this conversation at all, but this thinking has to be scientific and not eyewash for public consumption,"" said Ms. Grover. Ms. Naqvi, for instance, suggested weeding out sexist references from all school textbooks. Ms. Grover favors a 33 percent quota for female politicians in the national Parliament, as well as efforts to train all judges to sensitively handle sexual assault cases. Complicating matters is a backlash by men who resent the emphasis on women's safety. Farooq Abdullah, the minister of renewable energy, said earlier this month that he was scared to talk to a woman because he worried about ending up in jail. After widespread condemnation for his remarks, he apologized. Jayshree Satpute, a human rights lawyer in Delhi, warns that this paranoia is already playing out in offices after the law on sexual harassment in the workplace came into force last week. ""Women are being victimized. They are left out of projects, just because their male colleagues don't want the bother or risk of any trouble,"" said Ms. Satpute. ""Men are exercising caution not out of respect but from fear. That's not good."" Betwa Sharma is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi.",2013,"India"
"240","A Small Step for Women in China","Asia","BEIJING -- It was, arguably, the trial of the year in China. No, not the showpiece event that last month sent Bo Xilai, the political princeling and challenger to the throne of Xi Jinping, China's president, to jail for life. It was another trial in September, at which a court jailed another member of China's elite, Li Tianyi, the 17-year-old son of prominent entertainers in the military, to 10 years in prison for gang rape, with four others. An important detail in the court's ruling may improve the lives of millions of Chinese, feminist legal scholars say. Essentially, the Haidian District Court in Beijing ruled that even if a woman is a sex worker, as Mr. Li alleged, that doesn't mean it's O.K. to rape her. ''The court didn't go along with a quite widespread attitude, and an argument of the defense, that women in this line of business, women who are not virgins, deserve what they get,'' said Zhang Rongli, a professor of law at the China Women's University. ''I feel the court's decision is a very good answer to that argument and to that prejudice that you can divide women into good and bad women,'' Ms. Zhang said. ''That was really well done of the court.'' Of course, this isn't to say the trial of Mr. Bo, a former Communist Party secretary of Chongqing and son of one of the most famous revolutionaries, Bo Yibo, was not very important. It was. But ask any well-informed Chinese and they will tell you it was also politics as usual, the outcome of a bitter ''palace struggle'' for power by members of the ruling circle. The accusations of corruption and abuse of power, upheld by the court, are numbingly familiar to ordinary people as they go about the daily business of raising their families and getting by. The case against Mr. Li and his friends, on the other hand, has set an important and highly visible legal precedent and highlighted the welfare of the women who work in China's illegal but widespread sex industry as well as the arrogance of China's well-connected, gilded youth, scholars said. Here are the facts, according to a document on the court's Web site. (Ms. Zhang said the verdict has not yet been released in its entirety. The case was heard in a closed court since four of the five defendants are juveniles.) In the early hours of Feb. 17, Mr. Li and his friends were drinking, singing and playing games with the victim, identified as Ms. Yang, and another person surnamed Xu, in a bar in the basement of the Dongyuan Building in Haidian district, the capital's university area, in a party arranged by a Ms. Zhang, who worked at the bar. According to local news reports, Ms. Yang worked at a company and was a part-time university student and a bar hostess. Later, they left in a car with an intoxicated-appearing Ms. Yang who, realizing that she was alone with the men, asked to leave. They refused and, using violence, brought her to a hotel room in the Hubei Building, where they raped and assaulted her between 5:50 and 7:30 a.m., the court said. Mr. Li was the main perpetrator and showed no remorse, it said. To provide some context: In a report released last month by four U.N. agencies, titled ''Why do some men use violence against women and how can we prevent it?'' 22.2 percent of 998 Chinese men reported that they had raped a woman, including a partner; 2.2 percent said they had taken part in a gang rape. The survey, of more than 10,000 men in six Asian countries, put China's gang rape figure behind those of Papua New Guinea (14 percent) and Cambodia (5.2 percent), but ahead of Sri Lanka (1.6 percent) and Bangladesh (average 1.65 percent, urban and rural.) Zhang Rongli, the law professor, said that about 30,000 rape cases are reported annually to the police in China but that the figure is presumed to be a small percentage of the actual crimes. Across Asia, the U.N. report said, most men who commit rape go unpunished: ''The study found that the vast majority of men who had perpetrated rape (72--97 percent in most sites) did not experience any legal consequences.'' That makes the Beijing trial important by any measure, especially when seen together with the court's rejection of the argument by Mr. Li's lawyers and his mother, the glamorous singer Meng Ge, that the victim was to blame, for the ''mistake'' of being a bar hostess and a non-virgin. Here's what the court said: ''As for the assertion about whether the victim was or was not a 'bar hostess' or a virgin,'' that was a question of ''individual privacy,'' which ''has no influence on the determination of the facts of the case.'' The ruling will carry weight, Ms. Zhang said. ''If the Haidian Court made this judgment, can you reach a different judgment in your province or district? Not really. The law must be applied across the nation uniformly,'' she said. Also, she said, ''It was decided in Beijing, and that has a disproportionate national influence.'' While no exact figures are available for how many women work in the sex industry in China, many believe it is many millions -- and perhaps some tens of millions, when the entire range of services is taken into account including massage, hairdressing, bar hostessing and other often-ambiguous occupations, as well as outright prostitution. China stands ''at the beginning'' of any awareness of gender and the law, said Ms. Zhang, making the ruling an especially important one. Ms. Zhang, who is a co-editor of a recently published university textbook titled ''Gender and Law'' (she believes it's the first of its kind in China), says so far only three universities are using it in their law departments. Those are her own China Women's University, Wuhan University and China University of Political Science and Law. ''Gender is not part of the law school curriculum. It's only just started,'' she said. ''People think we already have equality, so it's not necessary,'' she said. ''In fact inequality is a very politically sensitive issue here. But there are a few sprouts.''",2013,"China"
"241","Calls Grow Louder for Human Rights Chairman to Resign After Harassment Complaint","Asia","NEW DELHI - Lawmakers in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, joined women's rights groups on Tuesday in calling for the resignation of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission chairman, who is accused of sexually harassing a law intern last year. The law intern, Stella James, wrote a post for the Journal of Indian Law and Society blog last month in which she said she had been sexually assaulted in December 2012 by an unnamed retired Supreme Court judge in Delhi, just as the streets of the capital were crammed with people angry about the gang rape of a 23-year-old student. A three-member Supreme Court inquiry panel looked into the allegations last month and found that Asok Kumar Ganguly, a retired Supreme Court judge who heads the West Bengal Human Rights Commission, had exhibited ""unwelcome behavior"" toward the intern in his hotel room on Dec. 24, 2012. However, women's rights activists have been outraged that the Supreme Court declined to pursue the matter further because Mr. Ganguly had been retired at the time of the encounter and the intern was not working for the court. On Monday, The Indian Express published on its front page excerpts from Ms. James's testimony to the judicial panel, during which she said Mr. Ganguly told her that he loved her and invited her to stay the night in his room. On Tuesday in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O'Brien, a Trinamool Congress lawmaker from West Bengal, held up a copy of that edition of the newspaper and declared, ""The gentleman has to go."" Another member shouted in response, ""He is not a gentleman!"" Shivanand Tiwari, a Janata Dal (United) member of Parliament from Bihar, said Mr. Ganguly should immediately be fired by the Indian president, Pranab Mukherjee, who has the authority to do so under the law. Mr. Ganguly, who has denied the accusations, has refused to step down from the human rights commission. Reached on his mobile phone in Kolkata on Tuesday, he said, ""I do not comment on parliamentary proceedings.""",2013,"India"
"242","The Beast in India's Midst","Asia","NEW DELHI -- About a month ago Shoma Chaudhury, a feminist journalist of considerable renown, moderated a panel entitled ''The Beast in Our Midst: Rape Survivors Speak Their Stories'' at the annual ideas festival of her magazine, Tehelka. The symposium in Goa was attended by Robert De Niro, among other luminaries. Today, Chaudhury, who was the managing editor of a publication revered in Indian liberal circles for its exposés of political corruption, has quit her job, had her Delhi home defaced by an angry mob, been pilloried for supposedly acting as an accomplice to rape, and, in her own words in an email to the editor in chief of The Hindustan Times, ''been lynched by the media for things I did not do, vilified on the basis of half-truths and fictions.'' Chaudhury's story is a troubling one of an India that has awoken with fierce indignation to the issue of predatory sexual violence over the past year, ever since a 23-year-old student in Delhi died after being gang-raped on a bus. A further gang-rape case in Mumbai involving slum-dwelling young men on a casual ''hunt'' for a victim has fueled a debate in which India's fast-changing sexual mores, Bollywood's portrayal of women as sex objects, encrusted male attitudes of entitlement and old habits of concealment have all figured. Tehelka, under Chaudhury's editorship, has been a prominent voice for women's rights. A colossal political and media outcry has now engulfed her life. This much is clear in the storm. Ten days after the Goa festival, a young Tehelka journalist (who had been detailed to chaperone De Niro) sent Chaudhury a complaint accusing the magazine's founder and editor in chief, Tarun Tejpal, of sexually assaulting her twice in an elevator on Nov. 7 and 8. Tejpal is a charismatic figure whose investigative journalism has earned him many political enemies and near legendary status among India's intellectual elite. The young woman's Nov. 18 email to Chaudhury alleged that he had finger-penetrated her and left her ''in a completely distraught condition.'' It demanded ''at the very least'' that she receive ''a written apology from Mr. Tejpal,'' according to a copy provided to me. Chaudhury, having spoken to Tejpal, promptly responded, saying she felt ''my breath has been knocked out of me'' and assuring the journalist that the editor in chief was ''absolutely willing'' to provide the requested apology. The reply from the journalist, entitled ''Request for Closure,'' said: ''I need closure on this -- I need a written apology to me for his physical misconduct on two separate occasions. I need an acknowledgment of the same sent to the staff and bureau. I also need Tehelka to set up an anti-sexual harassment cell.'' In a further email the next day she stipulated that the apology from Tejpal must include admission of ''sexual molestation on two separate occasions despite repeatedly and clearly being asked to stop.'' It seems clear that, at a small magazine that was family to its staff, faced by a traumatic incident involving two people she was close to, Chaudhury was scrambling, as requested, to deal with the matter internally. Within hours, on Nov. 19, Tejpal apologized ''unconditionally'' to the journalist in an email that referred to ''a moment of insanity'' but left her deeply dissatisfied. The next day he announced he would step down for six months. Chaudhury forwarded his announcement to the magazine staff. She included a brief cover note alluding to Tejpal's abject apology for ''an untoward incident,'' a phrase she acknowledges may have looked too mild. Minutes later all hell broke loose -- and has scarcely abated since. The Goa police and government led by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party -- frequently the target of the magazine's exposés -- responded with rare zeal smacking of political vendetta for a Tehelka investigation that led to the resignation in 2001 of the then-defense minister from a coalition headed by the party. A criminal investigation was ordered. Chaudhury has been attacked for failing to report the incident to the police immediately, attempting a cover-up, trying to smear the journalist (a grotesque allegation) and betraying her feminist principles. She quit. The young woman, distraught and traumatized, also quit. The magazine is adrift. Tejpal has been arrested on charges of rape (India's new anti-rape law passed this year expanded the definition of rape to include insertion of any body part into a woman's vagina) and faces possible imprisonment of 10 years or more. He has denied any wrongdoing. But of course his letter of apology now represents a potential self-incriminating confession. Something has gone very wrong here. An unconscionable and criminal act may well have occurred on that elevator. That will be for a court to settle. But already, in an overheated media witch hunt, Tejpal has become ''the rapist''; truth looks like a hostage to a new Indian political correctness and to old political scores; and an honorable, talented, crusading journalist, Shoma Chaudhury, has been misrepresented, hounded and ruined.",2013,"India"
"243","Modi Is No Champion of India's Women","Asia","Vadodara, INDIA -- The mother, an animal herder in the western Indian state of Gujarat, watched in horror as her 3-year-old daughter was snatched from her. The kidnapper, an upper-caste woman from a nearby village who was unable to conceive, had been encouraged by her in-laws to help herself to a low-caste child. The mother pleaded with the village council and police for her daughter's return. But both were dismissive. So she approached the unofficial Nari Adalat, or Women's Court. Five members of the court walked to the village where the girl was being held, and confronted her abductors. They refused to budge until the family let them search their house, where they found the girl hidden beneath a pile of mattresses in a musty storage room. They brought her home. In Gujarat, a state of 60 million, a rural, grassroots network of courts has emerged to assist women shut out of more formal systems of justice. These courts originated with a few women in a Gujarat village in 1995 to combat domestic violence; today, there are at least 35 across the state, and similar tribunals in over half a dozen others. They have heard thousands of cases on everything from assault, child marriage and dowry disputes to accusations of witchcraft. After a complaint is brought to a Nari Adalat, its members -- about 15 women, ranging in age from their 20s to their 80s -- walk from house to house to conduct interviews. Everyone is invited to testify. Often the courts can't afford an office, and the meetings are held under a tree. Women habituated to a crouching silence can stand and speak freely. In a country where police are notoriously corrupt and cases can drag on for years, these amateur jurists, who are often illiterate, are seen as impartial and speedy. They typically render a verdict in only four months. And their services are often free. Nari Adalats can't issue legally binding judgments. They depend on strong local relationships and the trust of poor women and village leaders, which takes time and effort to establish. Men have been known to threaten staff and to humiliate women for daring to stand up for themselves. But once a court -- whose members frequently include people from oppressed castes and religious minorities-- is perceived to be fair, its decisions tend to be respected. But with national elections scheduled to be held by May, this remarkable women's movement is under threat. In 2010, Narendra Modi -- Gujarat's chief minister since 2001, a leader of the conservative Bharatiya Janata Party, and a leading candidate to become India's next prime minister -- called for the establishment of a Nari Adalat in each of the more than 200 administrative units in Gujarat. But his record on women's issues has been otherwise dismal. A 2011 census noted only 918 women per 1,000 men in Gujarat -- a ratio, below the already scandalous national average of 940, that hints at the magnitude of female infanticide. In Gujarat's tribal areas, upper-caste men seeking an heir will buy low-caste teenage brides. According to Oxfam India, more than one in three married women in Gujarat is a victim of domestic violence. Despite this, Ahmedabad, Gujarat's largest city, was found this year to have just one officer to register complaints of spousal abuse, provide legal aid, monitor cases and take victims to shelters, as required under a 2005 national law. At one point, this officer was handling some 800 cases. In February, the Gujarat High Court rebuked the state government for making a ''mockery'' of the act. Neeta Hardikar, director of Anandi, a group that advocates for rural women, says that while violence against women is a ''normalized phenomenon all over India,'' Gujarat's government is notably inactive. In 2007, Mr. Modi named Maya Kodnani to the state's ministry for women and child development; two years later, she was arrested in connection with an attack during Gujarat's 2002 anti-Muslim riots that led to the deaths of at least 94 people. Ms. Kodnani left the ministry and, in 2012, was sentenced to 28 years in prison. As if this history wasn't bad enough, Mr. Modi's government is now attempting to capitalize on the achievements of the Nari Adalats. Members of the new Modi-backed courts report that trust-building steps, so vital to the grassroots courts, have eroded. Anxiety and insecurity seem pervasive; the original founders feel sidelined. The features that made the program a success -- in-person surveys, nuanced assessments of caste tensions, meetings with local leaders, and home visits to women who often can't leave without permission from their husbands or in-laws -- are mostly gone. ' ''This government is more interested in making grand announcements and claiming credit than implementing real change,'' says Zakia Soman, co-founder of Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, an advocacy group. If any of Modi's courts are functioning, says one insider, it is despite ''political pressure from some ministers who want to control the Nari Adalat and be the voice of the women.'' This pressure is likely to intensify ahead of the election. Winning Gujarat is a steppingstone to national victory, and the Nari Adalats could be a conduit to hundreds of thousands of rural women's votes. Some local activists fear that Mr. Modi will attempt to install his cronies in the courts. If he becomes prime minister and nationalizes the system, one could envision this vehicle for justice becoming a political tool that conditions judicial relief on political support. Government backing isn't necessarily bad. Nari Adalats have long received assistance from a national program called Mahila Samakhya, or Education for Women's Equality, that dates to the 1980s. But while the program offers guidance and basic legal training, it respects the independence of the Nari Adalats. What is happening in Gujarat, on the other hand, sets a distressing precedent for the political manipulation of local movements in India, and signals that any successful grassroots effort is vulnerable to a political takeover. Nari Adalats offer a blueprint for the effective dispensation of justice in other parts of the developing world. Mr. Modi is right that they should be expanded in India; without them, many poor rural women would have no recourse to legal aid. But if his administration truly wants to help its female constituents, it must not use the Nari Adalats as political pawns. Instead, it should improve the formal justice system while funding private initiatives, like the women's courts, that support the public good.

"244","Muzaffarnagar Gang Rape Cases Languish in Police Files","Asia","NEW DELHI- About a month after the first report of a gang rape was registered in the Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh, the police acknowledged they have yet to question anyone named in the six gang rape complaints filed in the aftermath of last month's sectarian riots. According to Muzaffarnagar police records, six women have said they were gang raped and four others have said they were molested during the violence between Hindus and Muslims that broke out on Sept. 7 here in the sugarcane belt of northern India, located 75 miles north of New Delhi, where the men who gang raped a young woman in December last year were sentenced to death last month. The police said the women named their alleged assailants in their gang rape complaints, but Mala Yadav, the officer investigating these cases, said Wednesday that the police have not made any contact with the men. Ms. Yadav, who took charge of the investigations on Oct. 16, said she was waiting to talk to the women who filed the complaints, all of whom are from the village of Fugana in Muzaffarnagar district, but are now scattered throughout the refugee camps set up to house the Muslims who fled the area. She began looking for them on Oct. 19. ""I went looking for the victims at the refugee camp in Jaula village, where I was told five of them would be,"" said Ms. Yadav. ""But I could not find them there."" A sixth victim of gang rape is believed to have sought refuge in a camp in the nearby Loi village, she said. Ms. Yadav said she was going back to the camps later on Wednesday. But until she speaks to the women and gathers enough evidence, visits the site of the crimes and finds eyewitnesses, ""how could anyone be arrested?"" she said. The violence between the Jats, a Hindu land-owning dominant caste, and the Muslims, a minority in the Muzaffarnagar area, lasted for a few days before the police and the Indian Army could quell the riots. A total of 42,000 people were displaced and 49 were killed, most of them Muslims. The killings of two Jat men and one Muslim man on Aug. 27 inflamed tensions to the point of violence, but the cause of the killings is being investigated. Muslim villagers, fearing for their lives after loot and arson began in the area, sought refuge in makeshift camps in Muzaffarnagar and neighboring Shamli district. Since then, some have moved out of the camps. According to the police, a total of 500 initial complaints, known as first information reports, have been lodged so far and more than 1,000 people have been arrested on charges of rioting, committing arson and looting in Muzaffarnagar. Kalpana Saxena, a superintendent of police in Muzaffarnagar district, said the police were delayed in investigating the riot-related sexual assault cases because the initial team of officers that was formed in September did not include any female officers. Female officers like Ms. Yadav were brought in to deal with female victims after consideration by senior officials in the special investigation team, headed by Hari Narayan Singh, the senior superintendent of police in Muzaffarnagar. In the six gang rape cases, the police said the women, all of whom were married and more than 30 years old, had alleged that they were raped on Sept. 8, the second day of the riots. Five of the six reports were filed between Sept. 22 and 29 and a sixth was filed on Oct. 10. The filing of such complaints is rare in rural Uttar Pradesh, which is largely controlled by unelected, all-male village councils known as khap panchayats and where a woman who is raped is considered to have brought shame upon her family. The women's medical examinations were conducted at a government hospital in Muzaffarnagar when the women filed a police complaint. But the police said the exams found no physical evidence of rape because of the lapse in the time between the alleged sexual assault and the filing of the complaints. As for the molestation cases, Ms. Saxena, confirmed in a phone interview that four complaints had been filed, but when asked about the status of the cases, she said the investigating officer would have details. However, Ms. Yadav, said she knew nothing about the reports of molestation. ""The special investigation team is doing its job,"" said Mr. Singh, the senior superintendent of police. ""If they find the culprits, we will arrest them.""",2013,"India"
"245","Dispute Erupts in India Over Surveillance by Candidate","Asia","NEW DELHI -- In a set of telephone transcripts and recordings that were published by an Indian website this month, high-ranking intelligence and security officers from the western state of Gujarat can be heard reporting back on an unusual assignment: covertly tracing every movement of a young woman, meticulously documenting her contacts with men. Their findings were passed to another high-ranking official they referred to as ''Saheb.'' Though no one mentions his name in the transcripts, the context leaves little doubt that Saheb is Narendra Modi, Gujarat's chief minister, who hopes to be India's next prime minister. The ''snooping controversy,'' as it has been called by Indian newspapers, comes six months before national elections, as Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party rides a wave of anti-incumbency sentiment. After a flurry of reports in the Indian news media, Mr. Modi's government on Monday appointed a two-member commission to investigate charges that surveillance of the young woman had been carried out illegally. After the transcripts were published, a spokeswoman for Mr. Modi's party acknowledged that Mr. Modi had used government resources to monitor ''the girl,'' but did so because her father had requested security for her, so it was not a violation of her rights. Another version has come from a suspended civil servant from Gujarat, who says he fell out with Mr. Modi because he had information about a secret relationship between the leader and the young woman, an architect. The woman, who has since married, has made no public statements. The matter is unlikely to drive away Mr. Modi's supporters, who are braced for a season of partisan exposés. But it has set off a discussion of the use of state surveillance in Gujarat, which Mr. Modi has run with a firm grip since 2001. ''The fact is that for a lot of people, this is part of his appeal, that he is a tough leader, he does what he thinks needs to be done,'' said Shekhar Gupta, editor in chief of The Indian Express, a daily newspaper. ''I think people are overcorrecting for a very weak government, and there is a hankering for a strong government, whatever a strong government means.'' He added, though, that undecided voters might be concerned that Mr. Modi had used the police to follow the woman, who was not suspected of any crime. ''People who are in the middle may worry that if this guy comes to power, he'll have many more agencies under him,'' Mr. Gupta said. The website that published the transcripts, Cobrapost, said they were provided to India's Central Bureau of Investigation this year by a Gujarat police officer, G. L. Singhal, who is accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings and had decided to cooperate with the authorities. The level of scrutiny was extraordinary, according to the transcripts. The man supervising the operation was Amit Shah, one of Mr. Modi's top aides, who now occupies a crucial post in the B.J.P. campaign. Mr. Shah instructed officers to collect footage from surveillance cameras, supply records from the woman's phone carrier, follow her to gyms and shopping malls and tail her from an airport arrival lounge. ''In case she escapes, we can keep a vigil at the hotel,'' Mr. Shah says, according to the transcript. Mr. Singhal recounts the woman's telephone conversations, remarking, ''Sir, she talks very rudely with her mother.'' Mr. Shah nervously urges his subordinate not to allow the woman to slip away unnoticed, saying repeatedly, ''Saheb comes to know of everything.'' Neither Mr. Modi nor the government of Gujarat has commented on the transcripts, which were heavily covered on Indian news broadcasts. Civil and security officials in Gujarat did not respond to requests for comment. The day after the recordings were published, Meenakshi Lekhi, a spokeswoman for the B.J.P., questioned why ''CDs that were part of official state property were made available to members of the opposition,'' and dismissed them as a smear by the Congress Party, which leads the national government. Another B.J.P. spokeswoman, Nirmala Sitharaman, said in a later interview that the transcripts might not be authentic. ''We question the veracity of these transcripts,'' she said. ''Talking about it in great detail is tantamount to speculation.'' The National Commission for Women, a government body overseeing women's rights, last week requested an investigation into a possible violation of the Indian Telegraph Act, which limits the state's ability to tap phone lines. In an effort to forestall an inquiry, the woman's father, Pranlal Soni, a jewelry merchant in Gujarat, appealed to the commission with a letter, saying he had asked Mr. Modi, an old friend, to provide state protection for his daughter. ''My daughter is fully aware of all types of help that was rendered by the state machinery,'' the letter said. ''She is fully conscious that the said help was absolutely necessary.'' The commission has forwarded the letter to security agencies to verify its authenticity and contents. Another perspective has come from Pradeep Sharma, a former civil servant who now faces corruption charges in Gujarat. Mr. Sharma has petitioned for a change of venue, saying his prosecution is politically motivated. In an application submitted to the Supreme Court on Saturday, he said that he had introduced Mr. Modi to the ''young lady architect'' to whom the transcripts refer, and that Mr. Modi had feared that he would disclose politically damaging information about their relationship. ''It is for this reason that a number of false and frivolous cases against the applicant were registered with a view to implicate him and 'punish him,' '' the application reads. A B.J.P. leader, Arun Jaitley, portrayed Mr. Sharma's testimony as a Congress Party smear campaign. ''They are back to their old game of detecting a disgruntled police officer or a civil servant and getting him to make absurd charges,'' Mr. Jaitley said in a note posted on Facebook. Bharat Desai, the editor of the Gujarat edition of The Times of India, said the ''snooping scandal'' would have little impact in the chief minister's home state because ''it's a known fact that a lot of telephones are illegally tapped here.'' R. B. Sreekumar, a former director of police intelligence in the state, said he clashed with Mr. Modi in 2002 after refusing to wiretap the phones of a Congress politician, and was removed from his post. At the time, he said in an interview, about 150 phones were tapped through legal procedures, but ''a large number'' of wiretaps had been carried out without authorization. ''Tapping of phones depends on the government and the political leadership,'' Mr. Sreekumar said. ''Most officers are more than willing to follow the political dictate to advance their own interests and careers.''",2013,"India"
"246","Charges Carrying Death Penalty Filed in Mumbai Gang Rapes","Asia","MUMBAI - A court on Monday allowed a prosecutor to file additional charges that could carry the death penalty for three men convicted of gang-raping a call-center worker and a photojournalist on separate occasions in an abandoned mill. It was the first time that a prosecutor in India had invoked Section 376(E) of the Indian penal code since it was strengthened last year as part of an overhaul of the nation's sexual assault laws after a physiotherapy student was gang-raped in Delhi. The section allows the death penalty to be imposed on repeat rapists. Mohammed Kasim Sheikh, Vijay Jadhav and Salim Ansari were sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday, along with another man, for gang-raping a call-center worker. Mr. Sheikh, Mr. Jadhav and Mr. Ansari, along with a fourth man, were also convicted of gang-raping a photojournalist in the same mill. ""It is clear that habitual offenders pose a potential danger to society,"" Ujjwal Nikam, a special public prosecutor, told the court on Monday. ""The intention of the legislature is to see to it that the same offender as well as the like-minded prospective offender is deterred."" Mr. Nikam told the court that he was not pressing for ""a particular punishment"" when invoking Section 376(E). The court ordered a hearing Tuesday for the prosecutor to present his case that the three men who were convicted in both cases were repeat offenders and deserved harsher punishment than life in prison. ""The court must admit these charges as a principle of natural justice,"" the principal judge, Shalini Phansalkar Joshi, said as she read out the order. As the judge kept reading, the mother of one of the convicted men, Mr. Sheikh, 20, elbowed her way through a crowd and pleaded for mercy. ""Madam, please,"" said Chandbibi Sheikh, as two police officers dragged her to the back of the courtroom. Her son, who huddled with the two other convicted men near a witness box, was being briefed on what the new charges meant. In September, a court in Delhi sentenced four men to death for gang-raping the physiotherapy student in 2012. It ruled that the attack, in which the men had inflicted grave internal injuries that eventually led to her death, fell into the ""rarest of rare"" cases, the standard the Supreme Court requires for capital punishment. Even as women's rights activists doubted that hangings in the Delhi case would do much to stem violence against women, the death penalty has become central to the conversation about combating sexual violence since the photojournalist reported the crime in August. Himanshu Roy, Mumbai's police chief, said in an interview in September that the police were keen to register previous cases against the suspects who were involved in both gang rapes and impose Section 376(E). ""In Mumbai, we pride ourselves in the safety and security the city provides to its women. This kind of thing was unprecedented, unthinkable,"" he said. ""They confessed to five rapes, we are making appeals for the other victims to come forward so that we can register cases and give them the maximum punishment."" Umeshchandra Yadav-Patil, a former judicial magistrate, said that Section 376(E) gave the prosecution the legal grounds to try to prove that the Mumbai gang rapes qualify as one of the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. ""In this matter, the intention of the new legislation, which is to deter potential criminals, has to be taken into account,"" he said. ""The court has to also see that public conscience is not defeated."" Mansi Choksi is a freelance journalist based in Mumbai. Follow her on Twitter @mansi_choksi.",2014,"India"
"247","Human Rights Chairman Said to Resign Over Harassment Accusation","Asia","NEW DELHI - A former Supreme Court justice resigned as chairman of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission on Monday over accusations that he sexually harassed a law intern, according to local news reports. A.K. Ganguly, a retired Supreme Court judge, had been under pressure to step down from his post on the commission since a law intern, Stella James, wrote a post for the Journal of Indian Law and Society blog in November in which she said an unnamed judge sexually assaulted her in his Delhi hotel room in December 2012. At the time, mass protests over the gang rape of a 23-year-old student were rocking the capital. The Supreme Court took note of that blog post and appointed a committee of three judges to look into the allegations. The committee quickly submitted its report and found that Mr. Ganguly had exhibited ""unwelcome behavior"" toward the intern in his hotel room on Dec. 24, 2012. However, it declined to recommend further action because Mr. Ganguly had been retired from the court when he invited Ms. James to his hotel room. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Ganguly drove from his office in Kolkata to the home of M.K. Narayanan, the West Bengal governor, to hand in his resignation from the human rights commission, news reports said. Mr. Ganguly drove back to his house without saying anything to waiting reporters. Dhurba Basu, the governor's spokesman, declined to confirm or deny the reports of Mr. Ganguly's resignation, saying only that Mr. Ganguly and Mr. Narayanan met alone and that the governor had yet to issue a statement. As a Supreme Court judge, Mr. Ganguly was known for his tough judgments against corrupt politicians, but women's rights activists called for his resignation from the West Bengal Human Rights Commission after the sexual harassment accusations first came to light. Those calls grew louder after The Indian Express published the testimony of Ms. James, who described what had happened on that evening in Mr. Ganguly's room. India's additional solicitor general, Indira Jaising, released the testimony to the newspaper with Ms. James's consent. The issue was also raised in the Parliament, where lawmakers openly demanded action against Mr. Ganguly. After the news of Mr. Ganguly's resignation, Ms. Jaising told NDTV, an independent news channel, ""I am happy about it. I wish the resignation should have come much earlier.""",2014,"India"
"248","Aam Aadmi Protest Shuts Down Central Delhi","Asia","NEW DELHI - The heart of India's capital came to a standstill on Monday after Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, and members of his Aam Aadmi Party squared off with the central government in a public demonstration to demand that the Delhi police should be under state, not federal, control. As Delhi police officers barricaded the roads in central Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal also called on all residents to join him in a 10-day protest against the Delhi Police Department for failing to protect women. In a speech, he contended that the state government would be better at running the city's police force, which he criticized as corrupt and inefficient under the central government's administration. The standoff began early on Monday when seven lawmakers from the Aam Aadmi, or Common Man, Party, led by Mr. Kejriwal, headed out to the Home Ministry, which oversees the Delhi police, to demand the resignations of three station house officers whom they said had failed to protect women in three reported cases: a gang rape of a Danish tourist, the burning of a woman over a lack of dowry and an alleged prostitution racket. However, they were prevented by the Delhi police from staging a protest in front of the ministry. The ministry, headed by Sushil Kumar Shinde, had issued a prohibitory order against the demonstration, citing a law that forbids the gathering of more than five people. The Delhi police shut down four subway stops in central Delhi and set up barricades to seal off the North Block, which houses the Home Ministry and other government offices nearby. Chaotic scenes played out as a heavy contingent of police officials surrounded Mr. Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi ministers and kept them at the railway building, known as Rail Bhavan. When the Aam Aadmi leaders realized they would not be allowed to reach the Home Ministry, Mr. Kejriwal decided to urge the public to join him at Rail Bhavan to demand that the central government hand over control of the Delhi police to the state government. In a speech, he accused Mr. Shinde of being corrupt and called on the ""honest"" police officials to take off their uniforms and join the side of the common man. The Aam Aadmi Party has accused the Delhi police of allowing a drug and prostitution ring allegedly run by four Ugandan woman to fester. Last week, the state's law minister, Somnath Bharti of Aam Aadmi, demanded that the police arrest the four women during a midnight raid on their house, but the officers refused, citing the lack of a warrant and a lack of evidence. ""No sex or drug racket can take place without complicity of police,"" Mr. Kejriwal said. While women's rights activists and political opponents have accused Mr. Bharti of racism, his party has backed his actions. On Monday, Mr. Kejriwal held up a letter he said was from the Uganda High Commission, stating that several girls from Uganda being brought into India on the promise of work and education were being trafficked. But Syed Akbaruddin, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman, said the Uganda High Commission denied sending any such letter. So far, the central government has refused to meet any of Mr. Kejriwal's demands. Mr. Shinde said Monday that action would only be taken after a judicial inquiry against the three police officers was completed. He also said that security of the capital was too vital to be delegated to the Delhi government. Maxwell Pereira, former joint police commissioner in Delhi, said the chaos and sheer numbers of the Aam Aadmi demonstration were a security threat to the capital, especially in the run-up to Republic Day on Jan. 26. He also said that the chief minister was himself breaking the law by staging the protest, which has been prohibited. Mr. Kejriwal's criticism of Mr. Shinde has put the Aam Aadmi's coalition partner in the state government, the Congress Party, in an awkward position because the home minister is a Congress member. But though it opposed the Aam Aadmi rally, the Congress Party said Monday that it would not withdraw its support to the party. Mr. Kejriwal's political rivals immediately criticized the Aam Aadmi Party for the disruption to the city, saying that Mr. Kejriwal should act like a statesman and stop shouting on the streets as he did when he was an anticorruption activist. ""Did the AAP form a government to wreck the system from within?"" Arun Jaitley, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said on Twitter, referring to Aam Aadmi. Responding to critics who called him an anarchist, Mr. Kejriwal said, ""Yes, I am. Today, I will spread anarchy in the house of Mr. Shinde, the same way he has spread anarchy in our households."" The closure of the subway stations inconvenienced commuters in the morning, and the road closures snarled city traffic at night. Sibi Arasu, 26, who had been unaware of the subway closures, said it was annoying to look for alternative modes of transportation in the morning. Mr. Arasu, a media professional, said he was 20 minutes late after taking an auto-rickshaw for 40 rupees, or 65 U.S. cents,one way - a cost that could get expensive if the protests continued for 10 days, he said. In the afternoon, despite growing concerns of the Delhi police over security near government buildings, Mr. Kejriwal refused to move the protest to another location. By late afternoon, the number of Aam Aadmi members began to swell, and some began scuffling with Delhi police officers, whose numbers were also growing.The party said in a statement said that the state transport minister, Saurabh Bhardwaj, was detained and another lawmaker, Akhilesh Tripathi, was beaten up. By evening, even as it was getting colder and darker, the crowds were growing at Rail Bhavan, many to support Aam Aadmi, but about 20 were there to protest Mr. Bharti's treatment of the Ugandan women. And as people got ready to return home from work, the city was struck by long traffic jams, prompting many taxi and auto-rickshaw passengers to get out and walk to their destinations. By 10 p.m., Mr. Kejriwal was still sitting outside Rail Bhavan, surrounded by his supporters. Betwa Sharma is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi.",2014,"India"
"249","Pushing for a Law Against Domestic Violence in China","Asia","Last Thanksgiving, Kim Lee came down the stairs of her duplex in Beijing to see her former husband, Li Yang, standing in the living room. ""I screamed,"" she said. The couple had divorced nine months earlier in a blaze of publicity, after Mr. Li, the celebrity founder of Crazy English, a language school they ran together, admitted to physically abusing his American wife. Chinese women rarely publicize violence at the hands of their partners, but Ms. Lee posted images of her injuries online. Her forthrightness won her praise from women's advocates as well as many ordinary Chinese, though some reacted with fury at how she lifted the lid on a sensitive topic. Ms. Lee's experiences since then, however, have bolstered activists' arguments that China is in urgent need of a national law on domestic violence. In interviews, Ms. Lee, a teacher, said that after they separated in 2011, Mr. Li more than once threatened her in text messages. ""For our kids, you'd better pay attention to your safety!!!"" read one message, she said. Another: ""You need me to beat you again to make you better, you greedy, American psycho."" Mr. Li was ""very busy"" and would not respond to a detailed question list or otherwise comment, said his assistant, Anson Ke. So on her divorce, Ms. Lee applied for, and was granted, a protection order, the first reported in Beijing. The court order was for only three months and not detailed, simply warning Mr. Li that he would be arrested if he resorted to violence against her again. ""But it did in fact protect me,"" Ms. Lee said in an interview. Once he threatened to beat her to death, she reminded him that he could go to jail and he backed off, she said. ""What it does is take out that painful step of having to get evidence"" of an attack, which includes getting a hospital report and persuading the police to file a report, something difficult to do. ""I just report the violence, and he's dealt with,"" she said. Last May, however, the order expired. And since then, despite multiple applications to the court, she has been unable to secure another. Activists say her situation illustrates why laws are needed that would define domestic violence, nixing the common argument that it is a ""private matter,"" raising the problem in the public eye, giving courts, the police, hospitals and other social organizations a clear legal mandate to assist victims, and standardizing important measures like protection orders. Some, issued elsewhere in the country, have ordered the perpetrator to keep a distance from the victim, but the approach is piecemeal. Currently, the Marriage Law and the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women outlaw domestic violence, but they are vague, say activists. ""There are too many systemic problems, too many loopholes. It's just too easy to do it,"" said Feng Yuan, a leading feminist and a founder of the Anti-Domestic Violence Network, which has campaigned for a comprehensive law for 15 years. Figures of the scale of the problem vary. Last year, Tan Lin, an official at the All-China Women's Federation, said that 25 percent of women experienced violence in their marriage. But a study last year by Partners for Prevention, a United Nations program, found that 52 percent of about 1,000 Chinese men told researchers that they had been violent toward a woman. And protection orders, considered a crucial method of combating domestic violence worldwide, are still experimental in China. Courts try to keep them quiet, concerned that without the authority of a law and an established system of practical enforcement they may fail and the court may lose face, feminists say. Only recently did activists discover that another order was issued in Beijing several months before Ms. Lee's. ""Ms. Lee's problems show that China needs to formalize protection orders,"" said Ms. Feng. Because when it comes to violent partners issuing threats, ""there is no law that says that judges must solve this problem."" ""The courts are afraid of being overrun by applicants and of being unable to enforce the orders and therefore becoming a mockery, with the police not cooperating,"" she said. In 2012, the National People's Congress took proposals for a law defining and outlawing domestic violence into its legislative program. Every year, there have been a few deputies who try to push it forward. But after 15 years of lobbying, activists like Ms. Feng believe it's still very low on the government's agenda. ""A lot of people trivialize the problem, but it's not a trivial thing,"" Ms. Feng said. Many countries, including in Asia, have such a law, making China a laggard. In China, action is ""too slow,"" she said. ""It's just too, too slow!"" This year, feminists are gearing up to lobby again at the congress, which convenes next week. In 2003, the network submitted a draft law. Later, the All-China Women's Federation, a government body, also submitted one. Ms. Feng does not expect a law this year. Maybe next year, if things move fast, she said. And 2015 is the 20th anniversary of the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women, a landmark event held in Beijing that declared: ""Women's rights are human rights."" Despite the sense of urgency she and other women's advocates feel, she says it's important to get a good law, even if it takes time. ""The question now is, how will they draft it? What are their priorities?"" Ms. Feng said. Would, for example, protection orders be part of it? With the legislative process in China largely a black box, feminists can only hope to exert indirect influence. ""We don't have formal lobbyists like in the United States,"" Ms. Feng said. She singled out three groups of people to approach: state leaders, heads of departments involved in drafting laws, and researchers and expert advisers. As a civil society organization, the network cannot access to the first group and only rarely the second, but it can reach the third. The women's federation can access the first two; its leader, Shen Yueyue, is also a state leader. It comes down to a question of political will, said Ms. Feng. ""I'd say there are just a handful of groups willing to pursue this issue."" Meanwhile, absent court protection and a law spelling out the crime, Ms. Lee worries. ""He entered my home in the middle of the night,"" she said. ""I felt this was enough to warrant another application, since he obviously keeps threatening, scaring and trying to pressure me."" Her latest application was turned down on Dec. 23. She says she will keep trying.",2014,"China"
"250","Victory Over Bollywood for Underdog","Asia","NEW DELHI - It sounds like the plot of many a blockbuster movie: A group of underdogs take on a huge corporate machine to right an injustice, and in the end, the underdogs win. On Thursday, the plot came to life, as Sampat Pal, the leader of the Gulabi Gang, a crusading pink-clad women's group in rural Uttar Pradesh State, was able to convince the Delhi High Court to delay the Friday release of the Bollywood movie ""Gulaab Gang,"" which she said took her life story without compensation or credit. In ""Gulaab Gang,"" the Bollywood star Madhuri Dixit plays Rajjo, a woman who sports a pink sari and fights to set up a school in her village. In an interview with India Ink, the director, Soumik Sen, said that his movie had nothing to do with the real Gulabi Gang and that it was actually a tribute to all women, including Ms. Pal. The movie was set to be released on Friday, the day before International Women's Day, but earlier this week, Ms. Pal swore that that ""come hell or high water"" and ""whatever it took,"" she would not let this movie open in theaters this weekend. When asked about Ms. Pal's threats, Mr.Sen was nonchalant, saying that he would not be heartbroken if the movie was not released on the expected date. ""If Sampat Pal does anything to stop the movie, there is always a legal system in this country and we will see what happens,"" he said. Ms. Pal acted on her threats, filing her petition on Wednesday with the Delhi High Court. In it, she contended that the script was based on her life and the activities of the Gulabi Gang and that the Bollywood movie defamed her. She sought a permanent injunction against the release of the film and unspecified compensation for damages. ""They show women with sickles and axes in the movie,"" she told India Ink. ""We do not do any of this. We just wield a stick, which is only symbolic. So what kind of impression are they trying to create in the moviegoer's minds about us?"" On Thursday morning, the High Court judges agreed, with Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva blocking the film's producers, Sahara One Media Entertainment, and their agents, from ""releasing, exhibiting, distributing and promoting"" the film in India, and scheduled another hearing for May 8. Ms. Pal ""has certainly a prima facie case,"" the court ruling said. ""It clearly indicates that the movie is based on her and her organization."" The court said that if the movie were allowed to be released, Ms. Pal ""would suffer irreparable loss to her reputation."" The producer of ""Gulaab Gang,"" Anubhav Sinha, declined to comment after the ruling. Ms. Pal said Thursday that she would withdraw her petition if Mr. Sinha made some changes. 'My primary expectations, if and after producer Anubhav Sinha approaches me for permission, are that they rename the movie 'Gulabi Gang' and the heroine Madhuri should be named after me, Sampat Pal, and not Rajjo,"" she said. ""Bollywood should do justice to a poor woman like me if it is trying to make movies on women's rights.""",2014,"India"
"251","Adding Elders and Children to a Domestic Violence Law","Asia","A long-awaited law against domestic violence in China must address elder abuse, which happens ""quite a lot"" despite China's cultural tradition of respect for the elderly, said Sun Xiaomei, a delegate to the National People's Congress, which is meeting now in Beijing. Ms. Sun, a professor at the School of Gender and Social Development at China Women's University in Beijing, added that significant protections for children must also be written into the law. Child abuse is also a serious problem in a culture where ""da ma"" ([#x6253][#x9a82]), or ""hit and scold,"" is still widely considered an acceptable way to raise children. In fact, a domestic violence law should recognize all potential victims - spouses, including men; the elderly; and children - and empower courts to issue protection orders that would shield them from their abusers, she said. But progress on a law, which was first introduced to the legislative agenda in 2012, has been slow, said Ms. Sun, in an interview on Friday. So on Wednesday, the opening day of the annual meeting, she immediately filed a ""speed-up motion,"" she said. ""It should be able to come into being before this current session of the congress ends in 2018,"" she said. (The National People's Congress meets 10 days a year, over a five-year term.) The prognosis will disappoint activists who had hoped a domestic violence law might be enacted as early as next year, the 20th anniversary of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held in Beijing. The conference was a landmark event for global feminism, declaring in its platform that ""Women's rights are human rights."" As a delegate to the National People's Congress, Ms. Sun has privileged insights into the usually opaque process of law-making in China, and her comments are likely to be closely analyzed by feminists and legal activists seeking clues as to what a domestic violence law may contain. Reflecting concerns among feminists that the law should require effective protection orders to keep assailants away from their victims, most of whom are women, she said she agreed that such court orders were essential and had filed a second motion on Wednesday, calling on the police to be charged with enforcing them. Feminists say that the police must be involved in enforcement of protection orders since they are often the first responders to violent situations. Currently, someone who goes to the police seeking help against a violent family member will generally be advised to return home and ""work it out,"" many victims and activists say. Chinese culture has traditionally regarded family abuse as a private, not a criminal, matter. ""Two hundred protection orders have been issued in China so far,"" said Ms. Sun. ""The orders are working very well."" However, only some of them spell out the physical distance abusers must maintain from their victims or state, for example, that they may not enter their homes, she said. ""We need the police to implement the orders, and they must get training,"" Ms. Sun said. ""I've already spoken to the Ministry of Public Security about this, and they have accepted my suggestion.""",2014,"China"
"252","What They Said: Death Penalty Imposed in Mumbai Gang Rapes","Asia","A Mumbai court on Friday sentenced to death three men convicted of two separate instances of gang rape, invoking for the first time a section of the Indian Penal Code that allows the death penalty for repeat rapists even without the death of a victim. The men, Mohammed Kasim Sheikh, Salim Ansari and Vijay Jadhav, were convicted of raping both a call-center operator and a photojournalist in an abandoned mill building in separate assaults last year. The three men had previously received a sentence of life imprisonment in the former case, but a special prosecutor, Ujjwal Nikam, filed additional charges under Section 376(E) of the Indian Penal Code, which allows the death penalty to be imposed on repeat rapists. Two other men, each involved in one attack but not the other, were given sentences of life in prison, while a sixth suspect, a juvenile, is being tried separately. The section was strengthened when the country's sexual assault laws were overhauled last year after a physiotherapy student was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012. Here are some of the responses to the Mumbai court's sentence: Badri Singh, father of the New Delhi woman who died after being gang-raped in 2012: ""This is great news. This is exactly the treatment that ought to be meted out to such men. There is no other way but to hang them. The judge who pronounced this sentencing, I wish to thank him and welcome his judgment. Nobody can comprehend how we and our daughters would have suffered."" Flavia Agnes, women's rights lawyer in Mumbai: ""I am opposed to death penalty. The court has wrongly interpreted the repeat offenders clause. They just wanted to make a showcase of this case. There is nothing for the victim, they have not provided her with anything as relief. They are giving the death penalty as if it's for their own sake."" Kavita Krishnan, a leader of the All India Progressive Women's Association: ""To say that reform is not possible because these people are intrinsically evil, why did you not catch them on the first instance and then attempt to reform them? When no intent has been to reform, I think this is not a judicial argument and not a moral argument and not a feminist argument."" Vrinda Grover, a women's rights advocate and lawyer: ""The death sentence is not going to diminish violence against women which is deeply rooted in unequal and discriminatory practices. This is a way in which the society and particularly the state abdicates its larger responsibility towards creating a culture and environment that provides dignity and safety to women."" On social media, the reactions were more celebratory: #Justice at last! Strong message to inhuman rapists!! Death to 3 convicts & Life to 1 in #mumbai's Shakti Mills gang rapes. #rape - Tulsidas V.

"253","Chinese Officials Widen Campaign Against Vices","Asia","BEIJING -- The Chinese government has widened a crackdown on prostitution, gambling and drug use to major provinces across the country, according to reports on Monday in state-run news organizations. The crackdown is being overseen by officials in the Ministry of Public Security, which manages most police forces in China. Officials in the ministry had already sent a supervisory group to carry out the first step in the nationwide sweep, which began on Feb. 10 in the southern city of Dongguan, according to a statement on the ministry's website. Dongguan, a manufacturing hub teeming with migrant workers, is sometimes known as China's Sin City, and prostitution there had long been tolerated as a significant part of the local economy. The statement was posted one day after China Central Television broadcast a program on Feb. 9 that purported to expose the prevalence of prostitution in Dongguan. The program prompted criticism online by a range of people, including women's rights advocates, who say the police are unfairly singling out prostitutes. On Monday, a Chinese newspaper, Beijing News, reported that the Ministry of Public Security had ordered provinces across China to follow the example of Guangdong, the southern province next to Hong Kong that includes Dongguan. The report said 16 cities in nine provinces had begun taking part in the ''sweep yellow'' campaign, called that because yellow in Chinese can refer to things of an erotic, lewd or sexually illicit nature. Since the start of the sweep, police units across China had investigated almost 1,500 cases related to prostitution, uncovered 73 criminal gangs, arrested more than 500 people and shut down more than 2,400 sites where sex was for sale, Beijing News reported Tuesday. The new crackdown appears intended to send a message similar to the so-called anticorruption campaign promoted by President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party leader. Mr. Xi has made it a goal to force recalcitrant elements of the party to fall in line with the central leadership. ''I think it is another step by Xi to tighten control on ideology and society,'' said Ai Xiaoming, a literature professor at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, and a gender studies scholar. ''Xi wants a China that is completely under control and has no such thing as a sex industry. There is no such thing as a sex worker in Xi's China dream.'' Li Sipan, a women's rights advocate in Guangzhou, said: ''Xi has his own vision for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, which has a very strong moral aspect. The campaign again shows Xi's conservative and purity-based values. It is another step towards Xi-style China.'' ''As a women's rights advocate, I'm worried that there might be a lot of abuse of power by the police towards sex workers,'' Ms. Li added. News reports in recent days have listed participating provinces, including Gansu, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong and Sichuan. One report, for example, said 6,500 police officers had been involved in a crackdown on prostitution, gambling and drug use in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. The crackdown began on Feb. 10, and 335 people have been arrested on charges related to the three vices, the report said. In Harbin, the frigid capital of Heilongjiang Province in northeast China, more than 4,800 police officers checked more than 2,700 locations and detained at least 27 people, according to one news report. Prostitution is common across China, where many hotels offer sex for pay, and hair salons and massage parlors often serve as fronts for brothels. When police officers do round up prostitutes, they might detain them for long periods in systems of extralegal punishment, including one called ''custody and education,'' in which those held are forced to do labor. People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party, has been publishing editorials and commentaries supporting the crackdown. One published on Thursday ran under the headline ''The boundary of right and wrong should not be blurred.'' The next day, the newspaper ran a similar opinion piece with the headline ''The bottom line of civilization must not be profaned.'' The essay went on to say: ''Any healthy society, while having a diverse range of ideas, should have some basic bottom line, some common sense and value. Liberation of thinking doesn't mean having wild ideas, and it also doesn't mean an indulgence of behavior.'' During the crackdown, some officials have been dismissed or forced to apologize for their lack of vigilance. On Friday, the official news agency Xinhua reported that Yan Xiaokang, the police chief of Dongguan and a deputy mayor, had been dismissed from his job, and that officials were opening an investigation into his actions. Other senior police officers have also been dismissed. Party chiefs in four towns in the Dongguan area have issued public apologies.",2014,"China"
"254","High Court Delays Executions in New Delhi Gang Rape Case","Asia","NEW DELHI -- The Indian Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily stayed the executions of two of the four men sentenced to death in the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi in 2012, an attack that set off a public outcry and mass protests in India over violence against women in the country. The Supreme Court stayed the executions until March 31, when the court will hold a hearing on the case. If the court rejects their appeal and upholds the death sentences, the two men can still apply for a mercy petition directly from the president of India. A lower court convicted and sentenced the four men in September. A juvenile who was also convicted but is exempt from the death penalty was sentenced to a maximum term of three years in prison. On Thursday, the Delhi High Court upheld the death sentences of all four men convicted in the case, citing the brutality of the crime. Though many people, including the victim's parents, called for the perpetrators to be hanged, some human rights advocates object to the death penalty on principle. ''I oppose the death penalty even in this case,'' said Vrinda Grover, a women's rights advocate and lawyer. ''I do not see the death penalty as a solution against routine and systematic violence against women, including sexual violence.''",2014,"India"
"255","3 in India Sentenced to Death for 2 Rapes","Asia","MUMBAI, India -- Three men convicted of participating in the gang rape of a Mumbai photojournalist last year were sentenced to death on Friday under the strict provisions of a new rape law that has begun to cause unease among some women's rights advocates. ''It was rape executed in the most gruesome and diabolical manner without showing any mercy,'' Judge Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi said during the sentencing. ''There should be zero tolerance towards sexual offenses of this kind.'' The death sentences are the first imposed under a law passed last year amid the nationwide protests that followed the gang rape and murder in December 2012 of a student on a New Delhi bus. The three men sentenced to death on Friday, Mohammed Kasim Sheikh, Salim Ansari and Vijay Jadhav, were convicted of two separate rapes, one of the photojournalist, in August, and another of a call-center worker in July. Under the new law, repeat offenders must be sentenced to a minimum of life in prison, and may also be given the death penalty. A fourth man who participated only in the photojournalist's rape was sentenced to life on Friday; a fifth man convicted only in the attack on the call-center operator had previously been sentenced to life, and two other suspects, both juveniles, are being tried separately. The death penalty is rarely imposed and more rarely carried out in India, and even some advocates for women's rights said Friday that they were uneasy that the men had been sentenced to die. ''I think these penalty provisions need to be reconsidered,'' said Renuka Singh, a sociologist at Jawaharlal Nehru University. ''The purpose is to reform these people, not eliminate them.'' Persis Sidhwa, an advocate from the Majlis Foundation, an organization that provides assistance to victims of sexual violence, said the ruling ''only reinforces the stereotype that rape and loss of honor is equivalent to death.'' But Ujjwal Nikam, the special prosecutor in the case, said the death penalty was justified. ''This offense leaves a permanent scar not only on the body of the victim but also on her mind, self-honor and chastity,'' Mr. Nikam said in closing arguments. ''We have to send out the right signal to society. It is necessary that the lives of the accused come to an end. They must die.'' A police investigation found that the assailants had repeatedly attacked women who wandered into an abandoned mill in Mumbai. The defendants, seated in a witness box at the back of the room, appeared impassive and seemed barely able to follow the proceedings, which were largely conducted in English. After the judge's sentence, Mr. Sheikh's mother, Chandbibi, yelled at Mr. Ansari, the oldest of the accused, and said he was responsible for her son's death. ''My son is being hanged because he made the wrong friends,'' she said, as policewomen escorted her from the courtroom. ''It is also the woman's fault. Who asked her to go to an abandoned area? Why don't you hang her, too?'' Judge Phansalkar-Joshi ruled that the assailants' relative poverty and youth could not excuse the gravity of their crimes. ''They have used the most powerful weapon in their possession -- the penis, with which they have caused grievous injuries,'' she said. Mr. Jadhav's mother, Pramila, who works as a maid, told the court that the family had been evicted from their rented apartment in suburban Mumbai because of her son's involvement in the case. As his mother testified, Mr. Jadhav stiffened in his seat. ''We could not afford to send him to school,'' she said. ''My husband is an alcoholic and did not pay attention to our children.'' Mr. Jadhav, 20, was arrested while hiding in a video parlor. The defense lawyers had filed an application to adjourn the case, so that a human rights lawyer could argue on their behalf. After their application was rejected, they boycotted the sentencing hearing and refused to argue for minimum sentences. Mumbai's top officials, who had once expressed confidence that a version of the Delhi gang rape could not happen in their city, initiated a broad, high-level response when news of the rape first broke last year, as if an act of terrorism had taken place. The state assigned the case to Mr. Nikam, a public prosecutor known for bringing cases against terrorists, and who prides himself on having obtained 628 life sentences and 30 death sentences in his career. ''Asking for death penalty is not based upon a sense of revenge,'' Mr. Nikam told the court. ''But I would like to seek justice for the victim, her relatives and society in general.''",2014,"India"
"256","Delhi Chief Minister Calls Off Protest After Deal to Put Two Police Officials on Leave","Asia","NEW DELHI - Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi's chief minister, called off his party's sit-in protest over women's safety on Tuesday night after the central government agreed to place on leave two police officials who the Aam Aadmi Party accused of failing to protect women. On Monday, Mr. Kejriwal, along with his ministers from the Aam Aadmi, or Common Man, Party had demanded that the Home Ministry immediately suspend three station house officers who had handled three recently reported crimes against women. After their demands were rejected, Mr. Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party began a sit-in protest, which drew a few hundred supporters, causing the police to barricade roads and close subway stations in central Delhi. The central government had previously refused to suspend the officials pending a judicial inquiry, but Najeeb Jung, the lieutenant governor of Delhi, said in a statement that Mr. Jung asked Mr. Kejriwal to consider the security threat that the Aam Aadmi demonstration posed to the nearby government buildings, especially as the government was preparing for Republic Day. Mr. Jung promised Mr. Kejriwal that the judicial inquiry would be expedited and that two police officials would be put on leave. Acknowledging the compromise by the central government on Tuesday, Mr. Kejriwal said that the police officials who had failed to act in the reported rape of a Danish woman and in an alleged prostitution racket had been suspended. In the third case, he said, all the guilty parties in the burning of a woman over dowry had been arrested. As his supporters chanted slogans, Mr. Kejriwal claimed a ""people's victory."" ""Our government is sworn to the commitment of women's safety,"" the chief minister said. ""This is big victory for all of us,"" he said, declaring the protest closed. Earlier on Tuesday, after sleeping out on the street in the cold, Mr. Kejriwal had defiantly declared that his demonstration could continue indefinitely. At one point, a group of Aam Aadmi supporters lifted the police barricades that kept them from joining Mr. Kejriwal, thus prompting the Delhi police to beat them back with the long sticks known as lathis. Local reports said 12 people injured. Nripendra Misra, head of the Public Interest Foundation in Delhi, said the Delhi chief minister may have claimed victory, but many of his sympathizers will have been disappointed by his tactics. ""He is not interested in governing,"" said Mr. Misra.""He will create another situation. Calamity waiting to happen. Given another long rope, he will hang himself."" Meanwhile, residents heaved a sigh of relief that they would not face congested roads on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Delhi citizens' patience had been sorely tested. The Delhi police had closed four subway stations in central Delhi for a second day, as well as all the roads leading to central Delhi, causing traffic jams that cost commuters both time and money. Babloo Chauhan, a 24-year-old office attendant, would have normally taken the subway from Race course to the New Delhi railway station, where he was to meet his relatives. But because he had to take a bus to get there and an auto-rickshaw back, he spent a total of 175 rupees, or nearly $3, instead of the 24 rupees he would have spent on a round-trip subway ticket. ""Even the auto charge was higher because he had to take a longer route,"" said Mr. Chauhan. Mr. Chauhan said that as Delhi's chief, Mr. Kejriwal should have pushed for changes in the city's police in a more orderly fashion, like conducting meetings and forming policies, instead of breaking the law himself. An auto-rickshaw driver, Alok Mishra, 35, who voted for the Aam Aadmi Party, said he was still a huge supporter of Mr. Kejriwal and his protest to expose corruption in the police force. ""But actions that deprive poor people of their livelihood are not good,"" said Mr. Mishra, who stayed away from central and north Delhi, fearing traffic jams. Mr. Mishra said the combination of the rain and the closure of roads had hit his daily earnings, which is normally about 700 to 1,000 rupees a day. By Tuesday afternoon, he had earned only about 250 rupees. ""I am still with the Aam Aadmi Party, but if people continue to feel harassed by their actions, then they will turn against them,"" he said.

"257","On Stage, 'Nirbhaya' Gives Delhi Gang Rape Victim a Voice","Asia","NEW DELHI - When a 23-year-old student was gang raped and brutally assaulted on a bus in India's capital in December 2012, it provoked an unprecedented wave of public anger in India. But in one Indian woman, the gang rape also brought on a deep sense of guilt. Married and a mother of one boy, Poorna Jagannathan, an actress in Mumbai, had never spoken about the sexual violence she had faced in her life. While she was watching the continuous television  coverage of the Delhi gang rape, she said, she could not help feeling that somehow her silence had helped bring about such a horrific crime. Silence is what  actually holds the violence in place; silence is what normalizes the violence, she said she thought to herself at the time. Meanwhile, in South Africa, one of Ms. Jagannathan's Facebook friends, the acclaimed playwright Yael Farber, was also following the news about the gang rape and the subsequent protests in India over sexual violence. After seeing Ms. Farber's Facebook posts about the young woman's death, Ms. Jagannathan contacted her with the idea of crafting a theatrical response to the Delhi rape. ""Women are ready to speak here in India in the wake of her death,"" she told Ms. Farber. ""It has broken the banks of what is tolerable. The silence is coming apart, and we yearn to speak. Come and make a new work that enables us to do that."" In February 2013, Ms. Jagannathan invited Ms. Farber to India, where they collaborated on ""Nirbhaya,"" a play whose name borrows the pseudonym (which means ""fearless"") that the media bestowed on the Delhi gang rape victim. The play, which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August, is now showing in India, and started Monday in Mumbai. In ""Nirbhaya,"" five Indian women tell their stories about the sexual violence and intimidation that they have themselves experienced. Later, a cast of seven re-enact the assault on the real Nirbhaya, which was committed by five men and one juvenile. (Four of the men are now on death row, one died while in prison.) ""I believe in what I consider to be theater's true, original intention: to show us to ourselves in our true raw form - in order to be a healthier society,""  Ms. Farber said in an interview. One of the cast members, the astrologer Sneha Jawale, delivers a monologue recounting her marriage to a man who set fire to her in an attempt to secure a higher dowry price from her parents, openly displaying the burns that cover much of her face. ""The objective of the play is to smash the cone of silence that often envelops victims of sexual abuse in India,"" Ms. Jagannathan said. "" 'Nirbhaya' is a call to shift your mind-set, by shifting the shame from victim to perpetrator, by breaking the silence, by understanding that silence, apathy and ignorance all contribute to creating a culture where violence can thrive and go unaccounted for and get normalized,"" she said. At the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August, the play garnered glowing reviews and later received Amnesty International's Freedom of Expression Award. The play's organizers turned to the online fund-raising site Kickstarter to raise 50,000 pounds, or $83,000,  and received funds from institutions like Oxfam and the Ford Foundation to bring ""Nirbhaya"" to India. Ms. Jagannathan said she had spoken to the family of the 23-year-old gang rape victim  about the play, but they declined to get involved, and Badri Singh, the victim's father,  told India Ink that he didn't have any knowledge of any play based on his daughter. ""They gave us their blessing, though, when we spoke to them two weeks back,"" Ms. Jagannathan said. Though India was the inspiration of ""Nirbhaya,"" the play is not aimed at just this one country, Ms. Jagannathan said. ""Sexual violence against women and children is a global crisis. Nirbhaya's death has brought that fact front-center,"" she said. ""Making a play about this now is the one way those of us on this project believe that a brutal death like hers does not have to be in vain, and can in fact be the catalyst for change.""",2014,"India"
"258","Village Council in India Accused of Ordering Rape","Asia","NEW DELHI -- A young woman in West Bengal was gang-raped this week on the order of a village council, to punish her for planning to marry a man from outside the village, according to the Indian police. Thirteen people have been arrested in the case, including the village chief, who both ordered and participated in the rape, said Suraja Pratap Yadav, a police officer in the Birbhum district of West Bengal in eastern India. The episode began on Monday when Khaliq Sheikh, the man from outside the village, asked the young woman to marry him, and she accepted his proposal, the police said. When Balai Mardi, the chief of the village, heard about it, he quickly sought to block the marriage. According to local news media accounts, villagers went to the young woman's house and detained Mr. Sheikh, and the next day, he and the young woman were taken to the village square, tied to separate trees and accused of breaking community rules. Mr. Mardi ordered the couple to pay fines totaling 27,000 rupees, or about $442, Mr. Yadav said in a telephone interview. Mr. Sheikh paid his portion and was allowed to leave, but when the young woman's family refused to pay, Mr. Mardi ordered villagers ''to enjoy her,'' said a police officer who spoke on condition that he not be named. She was then raped repeatedly in Mr. Mardi's mud-and-thatch hut, according to local news reports. Mr. Mardi told the young woman and her family that if they reported the rape to the police, the village elders would burn their house down, Mr. Yadav said. They went to the police anyway on Wednesday, and within hours Mr. Mardi and 12 other suspects were arrested, he said. The chief of police in the area, Sidh Nath Gupta, said that the 13 suspects were charged with rape, wrongful confinement, verbal threats and assault. The victim has been admitted to a local hospital, where she is in stable condition, Mr. Gupta said. Sunil Soren, a leader from a nearby village, insisted in a telephone interview that people in the area ''respect our women a lot.'' But he said that Mr. Sheikh and the young woman were ''in an objectionable situation,'' and that such incidents ''pollute the minds of youngsters.'' ''In the excitement, some wrong things happened,'' Mr. Soren said. Village councils are common in rural India. They often enforce strict codes of conduct, and in some cases are deeply involved in deciding who will marry whom. Councils are often worried that marriages to outsiders will dilute communal land claims, among other concerns. Couples who defy the marital codes are sometimes murdered. Genetic researchers have found that India's population has hundreds of distinct subgroups, in part because village councils have been enforcing marital codes and limiting intermarriage for centuries. Several widely publicized rape cases over the past year have provoked outrage over sexual violence and violence against women in India, and prompted changes in laws and greater awareness of the problem, although there is little evidence that rape or gang rape occurs more frequently in India than in other countries. With just 7.5 percent of India's population, West Bengal in 2012 accounted for nearly 13 percent of reported crimes against women. Whether that demonstrates a higher incidence of such crimes or a greater willingness by the local police to take such reports seriously is unknown. Local politicians sometimes react angrily to the publicity given to rape cases, which they believe reflect badly on their administration. The chief minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, lashed out at rape victims last year, saying in one case that a victim was lying, even though the police found evidence supporting the victim's account. The gang rape of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus in December 2012 prompted protests across the country. In response, the government doubled the maximum prison term for rape to 20 years, created special courts to prosecute cases more quickly, and made voyeurism and acid attacks specific crimes under the law. Whether those changes have improved women's safety in the country is unclear.",2014,"India"
"259","A Ghastly Injustice in India","Asia","Yet another horrific gang rape has grabbed headlines in India. This time, a village council in the Indian state of West Bengal ordered the rapes as punishment. The crime: falling in love and planning to marry. The couple was nabbed after the young man went to the young woman's home with a proposal of marriage. In the all-male council's eyes, such a union between a Muslim man and an Adivasi woman -- perfectly legal under Indian law -- was unacceptable. Hauled to the village square, the man and woman were ordered to pay a fine of 27,000 Indian rupees each. When the 20-year-old woman's family protested it was too poor to pay, the council ordered the woman raped as punishment. Thirteen men, including the village chief, are alleged to have raped the woman. In rural India, village councils, known as khap panchayats, routinely mete out such horrific punishments. Couples discovered in relationships of which councils do not approve even risk being murdered in so-called honor killings. India's rapid modernization has given young women enhanced opportunities and freedoms, which these self-appointed guardians of patriarchal tradition view as a grave threat. In response, they have cracked down, banning women's use of cellphones, dictating conservative dress codes and even condemning women's education. Fortunately, reaction to this latest example of village justice has been swift. The alleged perpetrators have been arrested. India's Supreme Court has ordered an investigation into the incident and scheduled a hearing. The full weight of India's law must be brought down on the perpetrators. Authorities must also provide protection for the victim and her family. On Dec. 23, 2013, a gang-rape victim near Kolkata died after being set on fire by two of her accused rapists after she reported the crime to police. The gang rape of a college student in New Delhi in December 2012 has sensitized an outraged Indian public to violence against women. The Justice Verma Committee, set up in the wake of that assault, defined the orders of khap panchayats as illegal, and urged the government to crack down. Even so, ending kangaroo justice by village councils will not be easy. In the district of Muzaffarnagar, the village khap panchayat has vowed it will stop police from arresting individuals accused of committing gang rape during sectarian violence that broke out there last September. Indian authorities must not back down. These brazen affronts to the rule of law not only destroy lives but do grievous harm to India's democracy.",2014,"India"
"260","Indian Journalist Charged With Rape of a Reporter","Asia","NEW DELHI -- The police in the coastal state of Goa charged Tarun J. Tejpal, an investigative journalist and magazine editor, with raping and sexually assaulting a staff reporter during a November encounter in a hotel elevator. The case sent tremors through journalistic circles in India, where Mr. Tejpal, who has edited the magazine Tehelka, is known as a crusader for liberal causes and enjoys celebrity status. It also came after a year of intense scrutiny on the problem of sexual violence, and it will be among one of the first prosecutions under a set of tough, newly amended laws passed during a season of public outrage. Investigators in the case filed a 12-volume, 2,846-page charge sheet, which included testimony from 152 witnesses. Mr. Tejpal was charged with ''outraging the modesty of a woman,'' sexual harassment, wrongful restraint, wrongful confinement, rape, rape by a person in a position of trust or authority, and rape by a person in a position of control or dominance. If convicted, he could face a prison sentence of more than seven years. O. P. Mishra, the deputy inspector general of police, said prosecutors would move for the trial to be completed within 60 days, an unusually speedy process by Indian standards, and another provision added when the criminal code was amended last year. Mr. Tejpal has been in custody since Nov. 30. Raian Karanjawala, a lawyer representing Mr. Tejpal, said he had not yet reviewed the charge sheet and could not comment. The young woman, whose identity has not been revealed, in accordance with Indian law, said Mr. Tejpal had assaulted her twice in the elevator on the sidelines of ThinkFest, an annual event sponsored by the magazine. Mr. Tejpal initially wrote her an apologetic letter describing ''a bad lapse of judgment, an awful misreading of the situation,'' which was leaked to the news media. He later said that he had apologized at a colleague's insistence, ''as desired by the journalist,'' but that the encounter had been consensual and he had done nothing wrong. Evidence in the case includes the apology, as well as lengthy written exchanges and text messages between Mr. Tejpal and the woman and conversations the woman had with colleagues shortly after one encounter. The charge sheet details footage from security cameras outside the hotel elevator, and states that there is sufficient evidence to show that Mr. Tejpal ''has been evading police after commission of crime.'' ''It can be concluded that the victim of sexual assault in the present case is a young woman journalist who was raped, sexually harassed and her modesty outraged by Tarun Tejpal,'' the document continues. ''This incident has caused serious psychological injury to the dignity, self-esteem and overall personality of victim young woman journalist who has made a mark for herself in the field of journalism.'' Investigators have also sought information from the actor Robert DeNiro, who attended the event and socialized with both Mr. Tejpal and the journalist throughout the weekend, but have not yet succeeded in questioning him. Sunita Sawant, an investigating officer, said she had been told that he was traveling. ''We are in touch with him over email,'' she said. ''He is somewhere in California.''",2014,"India"
"261","2 Prominent Women Under Detention Are Hospitalized","Asia","Two prominent women - Liu Xia and Cao Shunli - were hospitalized in poor health this week, after months or years of detention, according to their lawyers and friends. Ms. Liu, 52, the wife of the jailed Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo, has been under effective house arrest for three years as her husband serves an 11-year jail term for ""inciting subversion of state power."" She was hospitalized on Tuesday, or Sunday - accounts vary - with severe depression and a heart ailment. Her emotional and mental state has long been regarded as fragile by supporters. Ms. Cao, 52, a former cadre at the now-disbanded Ministry of Labor and Manpower, was detained after she took part in sit-down protests last year outside the Foreign Ministry, where she and others called for ordinary Chinese to be allowed to contribute to an assessment of human rights in China, part of the United Nations' Universal Periodical Review. The protests had failed - Chinese officials did not allow them to contribute to the country's human rights report, and late last year China was elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council despite what critics called a record of rights abuses. On Thursday morning, Ms. Cao was sent to an emergency hospital in Beijing where she was put on a ventilator, said her lawyer, Wang Yu, and a friend, Liu Xiaofang. Ms. Wang and Ms. Liu said she had tuberculosis, a liver complaint and uterine fibroids. Ms. Cao, who was barred by security officials from traveling to Geneva late last year to take part in a training course run by a civil society group on United Nations rights mechanisms, was rushed to Beijing's Qinghe 999 Hospital from the Chaoyang Detention Center, where she was being held pending trial for ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble,"" Ms. Wang said. The lawyer said Ms. Cao had contracted the tuberculosis and liver ailment while in detention and that her previous medical examinations had been clear. Her friend, Ms. Liu, said, ""When I saw her in the hospital, she was on a ventilator and couldn't talk. Her lungs were full of sputum."" Ms. Liu said Ms. Cao's health had suffered in detention. ""She said she was not guilty so they were treating her badly,"" she said. ""A person like that needs good nourishment and medical care, and she was not getting it."" Late Thursday, Ms. Cao was transferred to Hospital No. 309 in Beijing's Haidian district where her condition ""improved slightly,"" Ms. Wang said. Meanwhile, Liu Xia's lawyer, Mo Shaoping, said he had very little information about Ms. Liu's condition or even her precise whereabouts. ""The police forbid her from communicating with the outside world, not even to say what hospital she is in, or about her condition,"" Mr. Mo said. ""Not just her - her relatives were also told to be silent."" He said it was the second time she had been hospitalized in recent years. ""Her health has been very poor for a long time, not just her heart,"" he said. ""Three years of house arrest have aggravated her health. She tried to apply for medical treatment overseas, but the authorities refused."" ""She is not allowed to say anything,"" Mr. Mo added. ""Indeed, I'm very concerned about her. What the police are doing - restricting her personal freedom, denying her medical exams and treatment, barring visitors from the hospital, and forbidding any information on her condition - is itself illegal.""",2014,"China"
"262","High Court Upholds Death Penalty in Delhi Gang Rape Case","Asia","NEW DELHI - The Delhi High Court on Thursday upheld the death sentences of four men who were convicted of gang-raping and murdering a 23-year-old student in the capital in December 2012. In September, a lower court sentenced the men to death by hanging after determining that the case fell into the ""rarest of the rare"" category, which the Supreme Court has said is the only one that can merit capital punishment. The men were charged with murder after the woman died from severe injuries sustained when she was repeatedly assaulted with an iron rod. In their order upholding the men's convictions and death sentences, the two judges from the Delhi High Court called attention to the ""gruesome manner of the execution of the crime"" and said that such a case was ""unparalleled in the history of criminal jurisprudence."" For months after the gang rape and the woman's subsequent death, protests were held across India to demand justice for the victim and greater safety for women. The public anger helped push the trial into a special fast-track court and pressured Parliament to strengthen sexual assault laws in March 2013. ""A strong message needs to be sent to the perpetrators of grotesque and ghastly crimes against women,"" the Delhi High Court said. The father of the rape victim said in a televised interview outside the courthouse that he was very happy with the court's decision on Thursday. He also expressed hope that it would serve as a deterrent. ""Not just them, but other people who commit such crimes should be given a death sentence,"" he said. ""If that happens, such cases will surely decline."" A. P. Singh, a lawyer for two of the convicted men, said in a telephone interview that the decision to uphold the death penalty was politically motivated. ""When the lower court passed the judgment, the Delhi Assembly elections had just been declared,"" he said. ""And now, they have passed this judgment as the national elections are around the corner."" A fifth defendant, Ram Singh, was found dead in a Delhi prison in March last year. A sixth defendant was a juvenile at the time of the gang rape and was sentenced by a Juvenile Justice Board to the maximum sentence of three years. The family of the victim is also demanding the death penalty for that sixth person, who is now an adult. The defense lawyer did not contest the court's upholding of the guilty verdict but contended that because the men were not habitual offenders, the courts should show compassion and try to rehabilitate them. ""We will definitely challenge the verdict in the Supreme Court,"" A. P. Singh said.",2014,"India"
"263","Rights Group Details Abuse in 'Black Jails'","Asia","One night in June last year, Ding Hongfen and about 20 others stormed part of the Dongjiao Guesthouse in the city of Wuxi in eastern China, breaking down an iron door with crowbars. They freed five people held inside in a ""black jail,"" an extralegal detention facility operated by the local authorities who regarded the detainees as troublemakers. One of those freed was over age 80, according to the human rights organization that documented the incident. On Saturday, Ms. Ding and four others, who have been in and out of detention and house arrest ever since, are to be tried in Wuxi on the charge of ""destroying property,"" according to the organization, Chinese Human Rights Defenders. The ""black jail"" (in Chinese, hei jianyu or [#x9ed1][#x76d1][#x72f1]) was one of many such facilities across China where thousands of people are held outside the scrutiny of the law by the local authorities or privately contracted security companies - and where physical abuse is common. With an important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership under way in Beijing this week - the 18th Central Committee's Fourth Plenum - vowing to advance the rule of law in China, a report by the rights organization suggests there may be far to go. About one in seven detentions in the country involves these facilities, whose existence is denied by the state, Chinese Human Rights Defenders , which was released Tuesday. They are ""breeding grounds for horrific abuses,"" the group wrote. Five years in the making, ""'We'll Beat You to Death With Impunity': Secret Detention & Abuse of Women in China's 'Black Jails'"" documents the experiences of 1,000 people who were held in the detention centers inside hotels, guesthouses, residential buildings, psychiatric hospitals, armories, storage facilities, farms and factories. About 80 percent of detainees are women, leading to the focus on that gender. Sexual abuse is widespread, the report says. The report's publication also coincides with the 59th session of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women at the United Nations in Geneva, which on Thursday is to hear China's national report on women's rights. The Chinese government is ""very nervous"" about the information about the extralegal jails getting out, said Renee Xia of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. ""It was very difficult to do this report,"" she said by email. ""The government is very nervous about letting the information about these 'black' jails be exposed, for reasons we provided in the report."" These include their violations of national and international law, and their widespread unpopularity among Chinese citizens. Nevertheless, their use is growing, as the local authorities try to absorb people previously detained in re-education-through-labor facilities, which were closed last year, the report said. The report was compiled with the help of human rights groups in China whose names were withheld for their protection, Ms. Xia said. Ms. Xia said that after one meeting with former inmates of black jails and re-education-through-labor camps  in Beijing, conducted by the rights group, ""police summoned a few of the helpers who gathered the victims and who themselves were victims. Eventually, several of them were detained for months during the crackdown on the New Citizens Movement,"" she said, referring to a movement to pressure China's officials to disclose their assets. Many of the movement's members have been arrested and sentenced since the beginning of last year. Many of the inmates of black jails are people who have traveled to larger cities in search of redress for injustices they feel they have suffered in their hometowns. Typically, these petitioners are abducted by ""enforcers"" hired by their hometown officials who fear the petitioners may embarrass them by revealing local abuses to their superiors. The petitioners are often incarcerated twice, once at the place where they are first seized and then back in their hometowns. The scale of the system is suggested by the fact that Chinese lawyers and activists compiled a list of 89 facilities in Wuxi alone that they said were being used as black jails, the report said. It found that while both men and women were beaten and abused in a multitude of ways, women especially were the target of sexual abuse; rape was common, as were being stripped naked and other forms of mistreatment: Typically guarded by males, women are more likely than men to encounter physical, sexual and verbal abuses and threats. Women are also more likely to be detained and abused for the purposes of intimidating or punishing members of their family. The women involved are often the poorest and most socially disadvantaged, the report says: Black jail detainees, such as many whose cases are examined in this report, include some of the most vulnerable women in Chinese society: elderly women, women in fragile health, impoverished rural migrant women, women who lost land or were victimized by forced eviction, women with disabilities, and mothers with their infant or other young children. Chinese officials deny the existence of black jails. From the report: ""There is no such thing as the so-called 'black jails.'"" Chinese official, at the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child review of China, September 2013 The report recommends, among other things, that China release all black jail detainees and adopt ""a comprehensive law on violence against women, including a provision about state-sponsored violence."" And the United Nations needs to demand an end to the practice, the report said: The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, during its review of China in October 2014, and the Committee against Torture, during its expected review of China in 2015, should call on the Chinese government to fully comply with the relevant international Conventions, to end all extralegal detentions of women and set free all detainees in black jails, hold the perpetrators legally accountable, and provide reparations to victims. With ""rule of law"" now on everyone's lips in China, the rights group recommended: All U.S., E.U., or World Bank-funded programs intended to push for ""rule of law"" reform, including trainings of legislators, judges, and police, should emphasize the illegality of black jails, bring up concerns directly with government officials, demanding the dismantling of all extrajudicial detention facilities.",2014,"China"
"264","Ye Haiyan, Rights Campaigner, Is Detained Over Photo Posted Online","Asia","Ye Haiyan, a prominent campaigner for the rights of women and sex workers, has been detained in the central city of Wuhan after posting a nude photo of herself on the microblogging service Weibo, her friends said. According to a police notice sent to Ms. Ye's family, the police charged her on Saturday with ""intentionally displaying nudity in a public place"" and planned to keep her in custody for 10 days. Twelve police officers arrived at Ms. Ye's home around noon on Friday and detained her, Ling Haobo, Ms. Ye's boyfriend, said by telephone on Tuesday. They also searched her home and took away three cellphones, four computers and two external hard drives, Mr. Ling said, adding that some of the devices belonged to him and to Ms. Ye's daughter. The photograph that drew the attention of the authorities showed Ms. Ye lying naked in bed, with a sign propped against her leg that read: ""Elimination of Discrimination Convention. Don't you know?"" Two fully dressed men appear next to her in the photo, also holding signs. One of the signs refers to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, a sort of bill of rights for women. The photo has since been deleted from the Weibo site. The Global Times newspaper quoted a friend of Ms. Ye's as saying that the campaigner had uploaded the photo to highlight China's record on human rights, which was under review last month at a hearing of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in Geneva. According to Mr. Ling, the police initially accused Ms. Ye of two other crimes, based on documents found on the  electronic devices in her home. In one, Ms. Ye is said to advocate shaving one's head to express support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. The two additional charges were eventually dropped, Mr. Ling said. This is the second time in two years that Ms. Ye has been detained by the authorities. In May 2013, she was apprehended after she campaigned against a school principal who had been accused of raping six female students in a hotel. She and several other demonstrators held placards outside the school that read: ""Principal: Find me if you want to get a room - spare the school children."" Photos of the episode were posted online and drew a public outcry. In 2005, Ms. Ye started a website to support sex workers. The following year she founded the China Grassroots Women's Rights Center in Wuhan. It is not the first time the authorities have confronted Ms. Ye, her friends said. In July 2013, she and her daughter were evicted from the home they rented in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, after security agents said she was not welcome in the city. In July this year, she was not granted permission to travel to Melbourne, Australia, to attend an international conference on AIDS. Mr. Ling said that he, Ms. Ye's father and a friend of Ms. Ye's had spoken with her Monday evening at the Wuhan No. 1 Detention Center, via an Internet connection. Ms. Ye told them that she expected to be released on Nov. 11. Shortly after the call, the three went to the home of Ms. Ye's parents. Later that night, Mr. Ling said, the police knocked on the door, interrogated Ms. Ye's parents and forced Mr. Ling and the friend to leave. Mr. Ling said Tuesday night that his own father was being questioned by the police at a station in Wuhan, and that he had been told to come get his father or risk having him be formally detained. Mr. Ling said he was going to bring his father home. He added that he feared that he might be detained for assisting Ms. Ye in her online activism and that he wanted to pass along personal documents to friends for safekeeping. ""There's no justice,"" said a friend of Ms. Ye's, who requested that she be identified only by her surname, Li, because of the sensitivity of the situation. ""They simply did not detain her in accordance with the law.""",2014,"China"
"265","China Drafts Its First Domestic Violence Law, but Rights Advocates Say It Falls Short","Asia","For nearly two decades, Chinese feminists, lawyers and rights advocates have called for laws to tackle violence in the family. This week the government published a draft of what would be China's first national law addressing the issue, and while activists welcome it as a step forward, they also say it falls short of what is needed. The draft of the proposed Anti-Domestic Violence Law was published on Tuesday by the State Council's Legislative Affairs Office. Citizens have a month to tell the government what they think of the draft, after which it will enter the legislative calendar. Although the country's Family Law was amended in 2001 to ban domestic violence for the first time, the term was not legally defined. The new draft legislation, by contrast, cites violence between married couples, which the government says occurs in one-quarter of families (others have offered higher estimates). The draft also details other forms of abuse within families, such as parents beating children and attacks on the elderly. According to figures released in 2010 by the All-China Women's Federation, 53 percent of boys and 33 percent of girls were physically punished at home. This still defines the problem too narrowly, rights groups say, for example by not mentioning sexual or economic abuse. Nor does it consider unmarried partners or the divorced. Article 2 of the draft legislation says: ""Domestic violence refers to physical, psychological or other infractions committed between family members."" ""It's good that it's out, and there will be many comments and proposals for improvement made by groups during this month,"" said Zhang Rongli, a lawyer at China Women's University in Beijing. But, Ms. Zhang added, ""Women's rights groups feel that the definition of domestic violence is too narrow. It focuses on physical and emotional harm. Sexual and economic violence are not included."" In addition, she said, many people want a broader definition of what constitutes a ""family."" ""For example,"" she said, ""the status of unmarried couples that live together, that's not clear."" Nevertheless, in a society molded by Confucian principles that President Xi Jinping of China is trying to revive, the intrusion of the law into the heart of the family is expected to jolt many. By tradition, a father rules absolutely, giving rise to the phrase ""What father says, goes"" ([#x7236][#x4eb2][#x8bf4][#x7b97]). That point has come up frequently on radio talk shows this week as hosts reminded listeners: ""When this law takes effect, hitting your wife will be exactly the same as hitting anyone else."" ""This law is definitely a positive step in the right direction,"" said Maya Wang, a China researcher with Human Rights Watch. ""The law outlines the responsibilities of the various government departments in cases of domestic violence, making it easier for victims to access protection. But there are some major loopholes in the law that threaten to undermine the gains."" ""First of all, the definition of domestic violence is highly problematic,"" Ms. Wang said. ""It doesn't include some intimate relationships including those who aren't married, same-sex couples and those who are divorced."" The All-China Women's Federationsaid this week that 40 percent of women in relationships, in and outside marriage, have experienced abuse. ""It also doesn't address economic violence that often accompanies physical and psychological violence - like when an alcoholic husband takes all his wife's earnings and beats her."" Those issues were highlighted during the recent retrial in Sichuan Province of Li Yan, a 43-year-old woman who had been sentenced to death for killing her husband during an argument. In addition to his physical violence, Ms. Li and her lawyers cited regular sexual and economic abuse. The husband, Tan Yong, limited Ms. Li to 100 renminbi, or $16, per month for household expenses and beat her if she overspent, they said. He gave her only 20 renminbi a month for her mobile telephone. After she killed him, beating him with the barrel of his gun, she did not call the police because her phone had no credit, instead asking a neighbor to do so. Mr. Tan also raped Ms. Li after beating her, said one of her lawyers, Wan Miaoyan. In court, in accounts that quieted Mr. Tan's relatives shouting for revenge, Ms. Li's lawyers spoke of his ""tastes,"" without giving details. In a later interview, they said Ms. Li was anally and orally raped by Mr. Tan. ""Sexual violence is really, really hard for Chinese people to talk about,"" said Li Xinmo, an artist who has examined the topic in her installations. ""Many people actually think it's pretty normal. And the victims are so ashamed they can't talk about it."" The draft law's preamble says its aim is ""to preserve equal, harmonious and civilized family relationships and to promote social stability."" In a move welcomed by activists, it would establish a legal obligation for schools, hospitals and other social organizations to report such violence where they suspect it and for the police to respond to such reports. Most victims of family violence have difficulty getting the attention of the police or the other authorities, victims and advocates say. Ms. Wang said the draft legislation would not do enough to solve that. Although the proposal would require police officers to look into reports of violence, it also says the police may merely issue a ""written warning"" if they do not consider the situation serious enough for criminal or administrative penalties. ""This provision can provide opportunities for officers to shirk responsibilities from taking further actions,"" Ms. Wang said. ""Written warnings are not enough. The law should require the police to advise the women on their rights and options, and refer them to services and support organizations.""",2014,"China"
"266","Japan, Seeking Revision of Report on Wartime Brothels, Is Rebuffed","Asia","TOKYO -- The Japanese government has asked for the partial retraction of a nearly two-decade-old United Nations report on Korean and other women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War II, but the report's author has refused the request, a Japanese government spokesman said on Thursday. The decision to challenge parts of the report appears to be part of a campaign set in motion by influential conservatives to try to call into question the internationally accepted view that the women, known euphemistically in Japan as ''comfort women,'' were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers. While the government's announcement might play well with the conservatives who form the political base for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, an outspoken nationalist, South Korea denounced Japan's move. ''However hard the Japanese government tries to distort the true nature of the comfort women issue and play down or hide the past wrongdoings, it will never be able to whitewash history,'' Noh Kwang-il, spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said Thursday. The Japanese spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, said his government had sent a top diplomat to make the request personally to Radhika Coomaraswamy, a former United Nations special rapporteur on violence against women. Ms. Coomaraswamy, a Sri Lankan lawyer, wrote the 1996 report that called on Japan to apologize and pay compensation to the women. Mr. Suga did not specify exactly which part of the report his government had asked to be retracted. Calls by right-wing politicians and activists to challenge the women's stories have increased sharply since August, when a major liberal newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, printed a front-page retraction of several articles it published on the issue in the 1980s and 1990s. Those were based on the testimony of a former Japanese soldier, Seiji Yoshida, who said he had helped kidnap Korean women to work in the brothels. Mr. Yoshida's specific claims were later discredited by scholars, but conservatives have since seized on the newspaper's retraction to assert that the sex slaves issue itself is a fabrication, and that the women were common prostitutes who worked in the brothels of their own accord. Many mainstream Japanese scholars and most non-Japanese researchers reject those claims, saying Mr. Yoshida's testimony was never a major piece of historical evidence that women were coerced. They cite other evidence, mainly the testimonies of many of the women, who in the 1990s broke decades of silence. Based largely on those testimonies, scholars have concluded that tens of thousands of mostly Asian but also Dutch women worked in Japanese wartime brothels, many against their will. Japanese conservatives dispute that, calling the women's testimony biased and unreliable, and pointing to a lack of documentary evidence to corroborate their accounts. (Advocates of the women point out that the Japanese military burned most of its records in the weeks after defeat for fear of prosecution for war crimes by the victorious Allies.) In an interview published this month with a top Japanese conservative newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, Ms. Coomaraswamy said that the Asahi's retraction did not convince her of a need to amend the United Nations report. She was quoted as saying that the report was based mostly on the testimonies of ''a large number of 'comfort women.' '' She was also quoted as saying that the testimony of Mr. Yoshida, which was cited in her United Nations report, did not play a big role in its conclusions. She declined to comment further on Thursday. Mr. Suga did not say if the Japanese government would take additional steps following her rejection of its request. Japan's Kyodo News agency said the Japanese diplomat, Kuni Sato, Japan's ambassador in charge of human rights issues, met with Ms. Coomaraswamy on Tuesday in New York to make the request. Mr. Abe has argued in the past that Japan's wartime history has been depicted too negatively, and his government in February ordered an investigation into how Japan's landmark 1993 apology to the women was drawn up. The government later said it would uphold the document.",2014,"Japan"
"267","Harassed on a Bus in India, Sisters Lash Out and Video Goes Viral","Asia","Two sisters, riding on a crowded bus in northern India on Friday, lashed their harassers with a belt. They kicked, pushed and punched one of the three men so aggressively that another man on the bus had to come to his aid -- though the sisters said later none of their fellow passengers came to their defense. A video of the incident that went viral over the weekend shows the two young women, identified by Indian media as Aarti, 22, and Pooja, 19, on a bus from Rohtak to Sonipat, in the state of Haryana, defending themselves after the men made lewd comments and obscene gestures. Pooja told the BBC that ''the men started to abuse me and touch me.'' ''If only the other passengers had helped us,'' she said, ''we would not have needed to retaliate in this way.'' The incident was recorded on the mobile phone of another passenger. [Video: Two sisters fought back against men who they said tried to molest them aboard a bus in Rohtak, in northern India. Watch on YouTube.] Three men have since been arrested in the case, and the state government announced it was honoring the sisters with a cash award, the Times of India reported. It's been almost two years since the brutal gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi aboard a private bus. That case, and the continued threat of harassment that women endure in public in India, led to tougher laws punishing rape and more vigilant policing. Reports of rape in India have increased since then, and some observers say it's because more women are now emboldened to report such crimes. Though women's rights advocates say many incidents still go unreported. The Indian Express reported that the two young women aboard the bus in Rohtak tried calling a women's help line after the men began making lewd comments, but there was no response. ''A complaint was received Friday evening and a case was registered against the three men,'' The Express quoted Gajender Singh, a police inspector in Rohtak Sadar. In India and other parts of south Asia, sexual harassment in public spaces is commonly known as ''Eve-teasing,'' a term that many rights activists say trivializes sexual violence against women. Last year, The New York Times followed five women traveling by bus, subway and car in New Delhi to show the sense of insecurity that they experience on their daily commute.",2014,"India"
"268","Rape Ruled Out in Case of 2 Indian Girls","Asia","NEW DELHI -- When the bodies of two teenage cousins were found hanging from a mango tree in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh in May, the police initially said the girls had been abducted and raped, in what seemed like yet another grisly crime against women in India. But the country's top investigative agency announced this week that the girls, whose bodies were surrounded by a crush of TV reporters while they were still hanging from the tree, had killed themselves and that no rape or abduction was suspected. ''Our probe found that the two girls had committed suicide and weren't murdered,'' Ranjit Sinha, director of the Central Bureau of Investigation of India, told The Hindustan Times, referring to them as siblings. ''The local police had erroneously conducted their probe along the lines that the sisters were killed.'' The findings put a strange coda on a case that became a symbol of what many claimed was the precarious safety of women in India. Along with the case of a medical student who was gang-raped and tortured on a New Delhi bus in December 2012, the grisly deaths of the Budaun girls, so called after the district where they lived, is seen as representing all that was wrong with India's patriarchal culture. As recently as Tuesday, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, cited the Budaun case at an event celebrating an international day to end violence against women. As awareness of the case grew, the news media in this nation of 1.2 billion began reporting rapes almost daily, giving India an image of a place deeply antagonistic to women. Tourism suffered. Parliament passed a tough law to crack down on sexual violence. But many sociologists here have questioned whether India was experiencing a true epidemic of rapes or if it was simply going through a media-created frenzy. Surveys around the world have shown that Indian women actually experience comparatively low levels of sexual violence. The reasons are complex. For one, Indian women, particularly in the more conservative north of the country, are often severely restricted in their movements. In a survey, most married women reported being unable to visit a nearby village or neighborhood unaccompanied. The relatively low levels of sexual violence do not mean that India is an entirely safe place for women. Using techniques pioneered by Amartya Sen, a Nobel-winning economist, an American and Canadian research team estimated that there are tens of millions of ''missing women,'' as Mr. Sen called them, in developing countries. These are women who would be alive if they died at the same rates relative to men as women do in more developed countries. In a separate paper, the researchers concluded that in any given year, the number of missing women in India is more than two million. Much of the reason is that families invest far more in caring for boys than they do for girls. Approximately two-thirds of infants in neonatal intensive care units, for instance, are boys. Tens of thousands of women are killed annually in disputes related to marriages and dowries, researchers estimate. But overall, India has fairly low levels of violence, and that is true for women as well. Indian husbands beat their wives far less than men in many other developing countries, according to comparable surveys done in multiple countries. Domestic violence levels are far higher in Colombia, Egypt, Peru and Zambia than in India, the surveys found. In the Budaun case, forensic reports confirmed that the girls had not been raped. And the police said that a key early witness in the case, Nazru, a man with one name who was distantly related to the girls, lied when he told the police that he had seen a suspect drag the two girls away. That suspect, along with four others arrested in the case, has since been released. Still, the news media's attention to the issue of rape has had salutary effects, Ravinder Kaur, a professor of sociology at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, said on Thursday. The number of rapes reported to the police in recent years has surged, suggesting that increased attention to the crime may be encouraging more women to seek charges against their abusers rather than suffer in silence, she said. ''Whether there's a real increase in rapes recently is impossible to tell at the moment,'' Dr. Kaur said. ''And the Budaun case should give us all pause. People made a lot of assumptions about those girls, and now we know almost every one of those assumptions were not true.''",2014,"India"
"269","Young, Idealistic and Caught Up in a Wave of Detentions","Asia","Well educated and deeply committed to helping their fellow Chinese, Liu Jianshu and Zhao Sile are the kind of idealistic young people who pepper the story of China's transformation over the past century as it searches for a modern identity. But on Nov. 26, calamity struck the couple, married for barely a year. The police took away Mr. Liu, 28, who holds a law degree from Oxford and was setting up a legal aid organization in Beijing, on suspicion of ""illegal business operations,"" his wife said. According to friends and colleagues of the couple, however, the root of the problem lay elsewhere. They said the police suspected Mr. Liu of being part of a group of about 10 people who were spreading word in China about theOccupy Centraldemocracy movement in Hong Kong and the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan. Both are highly critical of the Communist Party and have called for greater citizen participation in politics. That one is in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city, and the other in Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China claims as its territory, exacerbates party authorities' fear of the spread of a ""color revolution"" on the Chinese mainland. Infusing the affair with a Kafkaesque absurdity, the couple's agony may have begun inadvertently, with a slip-up in late September by a young woman who was previously linked to them through the Liren Rural Libraries, a grassroots project, and the Transition Institute, an independent think tank in Beijing, according to two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution for speaking about a politically sensitive topic. ""It's like the 'butterfly effect,' "" said one, alluding to chaos theory, whereby a butterfly flapping its wings sets off a chain of events that results in a hurricane elsewhere. In an attempt to ride out the hurricane, Ms. Zhao, 24, has taken unpaid leave from her job as a journalist at the Media Monitor for Women Network. She has helped her husband find a lawyer, has deposited money into an account at the Beijing No. 1 Detention Center, where he is being held, so he can survive better in detention, and done other things that an incarcerated person cannot do himself, she said, including alerting friends and relatives. She's on edge, reflecting the heavy emotional toll of her husband's plight. As Mr. Liu's wife, she felt emboldened to speak to a reporter about his situation. But she declined to comment on broader political issues, or a wave of recent detentions connected to the movements in Hong Kong and Taiwan. ""I had talked to Xiaoshu"" - a nickname that means ""little tree"" - ""at 10:30 that morning,"" said Ms. Zhao, a slender woman with a master's degree in financial engineering from Nanjing University and a passion for gender equality. A few hours later he was gone. ""Now if I don't hear from a friend for three hours I get nervous,"" she said in a Beijing restaurant, fiddling with her smartphone. ""We are all in touch every day to see who's missing,"" she said, referring to the couple's circle of friends, many involved in gender issues or the law. ""I'm worried that I'll disappear one of these days, too."" Others detained in the sweep include a magazine editor, Xu Xiao; a think tank founder, Huang Kaiping; and Chen Kun, who administered Liren College, an educational institution affiliated with the Liren Rural Libraries. All had ties to either the Transition Institute, co-founded by Guo Yushan, an economist who has also been detained, or the Liren Rural Libraries, founded by Li Yingqiang to advance rural education. There was crossover between the two nongovernmental organizations. Mr. Guo's colleague, Huang Kaiping, is also in detention. Contacted by telephone at his home in the southwestern province of Sichuan, Mr. Li declined to speak on the record, citing the risk of detention. The Liren Rural Libraries, begun in 2007, were shut by the authorities in September. Liren College, set up some years later, was also forced to close, Mr. Li said in an interview last month. ""Liren"" means ""upright person,"" or ""to be raised up,"" reflecting its founder's belief that China needs more people capable of advanced and independent thought. Similar to the California-based Minerva Schools at KGI, Mr. Li said, the college was loosely organized and hired outstanding teachers. Students - at its peak it had about 500 - studied online. But that was all before late September, when a young woman, whom the two sources separately identified as Ling Lisha, made copies in a commercial photocopy shop of materials that touched on the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong. Her purpose was to inform and educate others, the sources said. In line with common practice, she requested an official receipt for the photocopying and put down as the purchaser the Transition Institute, where she had previously worked. ""Everyone does this. We collect official receipts related to work, because it proves what we spend our money on,"" said one of the sources, a member of a Chinese nongovernmental group. Such groups are obliged by the government to register as businesses and the receipts, known as fapiao, can be used to document expenses and defray taxes. But what Ms. Ling apparently did not know - or remember - was that many commercial photocopy shops in Beijing are linked by computer to the police, who can scan their business for just such activities, especially in times of political tension, said the two sources. Spotting the Occupy Central content, they said, the police pounced. Ms. Ling was detained on Oct. 3. Next to be taken into custody was Mr. Chen, the Liren College administrator and her boyfriend, on Oct. 5. He had just returned from Taiwan, the sources said. From there the detentions cascaded to take in more people connected to Liren or the Transition Institute. In addition to Mr. Liu and Ms. Xu, this included Mr. Guo, the Transition Institute's co-founder; He Zhengjun, a colleague at the institute; and the social activists Huang Kaiping, Xue Ye, Kou Yanding, Liu Bin and Zhang Qibin. In all, about 10 people. When Ms. Zhao met Mr. Liu, in 2012, he was back from Oxford and had helped set up Liren College. It was a stressful job, as the government was shutting down its classes. Virtually all education in China is controlled by the party, which imposes strict ideological parameters. Before going to Britain, Mr. Liu, who is from Qinhuangdao, a coastal city in Hebei Province, had also been involved in running the Liren Rural Libraries. In the seven years until they were shut down this year, nearly two dozen had been set up across China, aiming to help poor rural families gain access to education. The couple met when she interviewed Mr. Li, the founder, about the project, she said. ""In the beginning Xiaoshu was someone helping to set up libraries in the countryside,"" she said, speaking rapidly but quietly as she tapped on her phone with long, thin fingers, her hair falling over her face. ""And I was a journalist."" ""We wanted to do something for our society. But we didn't anticipate this danger and fear. And we still don't choose it. I feel like I've been 'oppositioned,' "" she said, meaning cast as an opposition force she is not. ""Xiaoshu was a victim,"" she said. ""And I'm the comrade-in-arms of a victim. We're young, and there has been a lot of heaviness in these few years that I never expected."" On Tuesday, after 13 days of waiting with no news other than the mailed notice of his criminal detention that she received on Dec. 1, she was told by the lawyer she had chosen, Liu Wei, that the police had granted a meeting with Mr. Liu at which Ms. Liu will be able to formally request his permission to represent him. ""I feel very happy knowing that,"" Ms. Zhao said. The meeting is set for Thursday, more than two weeks after he was taken away. Even as his wife, Ms. Zhao may not meet Mr. Liu while he is in custody ""unless he is sentenced,"" she said. ""And I don't want that."" In China, a criminal detention is often a first step, followed by a period of investigation to determine if charges will be filed. One source said that Mr. Liu is the only one of the 10 who has so far been granted permission to meet a lawyer. The families of several in the group have not yet been notified of their detentions, the source said, and some, such as Ms. Ling, have now spent longer than the 37 days in jail without the formal arrest - or release - that should take place at that point. Contacted by telephone, a person at the Beijing No. 1 Detention Center declined to confirm which, if any, of the 10 were there. Temperatures in Beijing have recently dropped below freezing, and Ms. Zhao worries that her husband does not have enough warm clothes. According to regulations, clothes brought in for inmates may not have zippers, strings or certain types of buttons, so she patches together acceptable clothes for him from other items in his wardrobe. Acquaintances of the couple said it was possible the affair would drag on into next spring, with Mr. Guo, the Transition Institute co-founder named on the receipt, expected to be held for prolonged questioning and the police reluctant to release anyone else until his case is resolved.",2014,"China"

Friends said Miss Unksova chose to stay and went to prison, taking refuge in the countryside after her release to avoid further prosecution. She was offered an exit visa in August 1982 and recently was told she could leave with her husband and children, aged 8 and 17, by July 19.",1983,"Russia"
"272","'Citizen Ch.': Russia Opens Files on Serial Killings","EECA","Two weeks from now, a 56-year-old man goes on trial here for a series of murders that may qualify him as one of the worst serial killers of modern times. ""Citizen Ch.,"" as he is known in the Russian press in keeping with a ban on publishing names of suspects, is accused of killing at least 53 children and young women over a period of 12 years, each involving a ghoulish orgy of mutilation and cannibalism. In the past the Government has been reluctant to discuss such cases with foreign journalists, but in the new climate the chief detective in this case freely opened his files to a Western reporter. Portrait of a Killer The case has attracted attention not only because of the quantity and horror of the crimes, which spread terror among the city's parents, but also because the stymied Rostov police turned to psychiatrists to help divine the killer's signature, which varied little from victim to victim. He found his victims usually at bus stops and talked them into following him to wooded areas, in broad daylight. His weapons were a knife, his hands and his teeth, and after 30 minutes of pathological frenzy a blinded, torn and sexually mutilated corpse would be added to a growing list. One psychiatrist, Aleksandr Bukhanovsky, studied the pattern to create a detailed psychological portrait of a humiliated, scarred, self-pitying, middle-aged and impotent man, a portrait that proved remarkably accurate when Citizen Ch. was finally arrested on Nov. 20, 1990. More Than 53 Victims It was only then that the full scope became known. Most of the vicious killings were was in Rostov, but the attacker had also killed in Leningrad, Moscow and five other cities from Ukraine to Uzbekistan. Rostov is one of the most important cities in the southern part of Russia, near the Sea of Azov, and has been a major center of military production for years. It is also the home of the Don Cossacks, a kind of professional military class. The police are certain there are more victims, but 53 is all they can prove with certainty. In the United States, the serial killer with the highest number of confirmed victims is generally believed to be Donald Harvey, a former nurse's aide serving a life sentence after pleading guilty to 37 murders in Ohio and Kentucky. Most of the killings occurred in hospitals where he worked in 1986 and 1987. Preying on Drifters Here, the known victims were 11 boys and 42 girls and young women, most of them drifters whose absence was never reported. How he managed to persuade them to follow him still bedevils detectives and intrigues psychiatrists. Gangly, rumpled, bespectacled, carrying a tattered briefcase or shoulder bag, he attracted no attention among passers-by. As he later told the police, he would walk up to a youth and mutter something about how crowded the bus stop was, that he would walk either to his car or to his summer cabin across the river, neither of which existed. He would off-handedly suggest that the victim come along. Fifty-three young people trudged after him, sometimes for more than a mile, until abruptly he would pounce. ""He said he never intended to kill, that he never thought of what he was doing,"" said Viktor V. Burakov, chief of the section for serious sexual crimes in the Rostov criminal investigation bureau, who led the detective work from the first crime. ""He said he didn't know why they followed him. He said maybe it was because he was a social outcast, just as they were. To some extent it was true. Seventy percent of the victims were drifters."" Mistakes and Close Calls A nurse said: ""We were all aware of it. Many parents would walk their children from school, and we'd always be edgy if the kids were late coming back."" There was another victim. In 1978, after a girl was slain, the police picked up a convicted murderer-rapist who had been released from prison on probation and was near the site of the crime without an alibi. He was convicted and executed. Citizen Ch. later claimed that crime as his first. The killings resumed in 1982 and in 1984 they reached epidemic proportions. Eight bodies were found in August 1984 alone. It was also in 1984 that the police made their second grievous mistake -- they picked up Citizen Ch. near the site of a killing and held him for three months. But he was released when his blood type failed to match that found on victims. The police still cannot explain the discrepancy. The police operation grew into one of the biggest in the Soviet Union. Fifty-five officers and experts worked full-time on the case and as many as 400 policemen were used in many stakeouts. Mr. Burakov showed a file cabinet with more than 25,000 names of potential suspects. The huge dragnet helped solve 95 unrelated murders and more than 300 criminals were caught in a variety of other crimes. But the serial killings continued. ""I felt he was mocking us, killing children under our very noses,"" Mr. Burakov said. Those were still days when the press was fully controlled, and the true scope of the killings was never reported. But word of a monster-killer was all over the city of one million -- the police held special briefings at schools and workplaces and occasionally appealed for information through the press, and the rumor mills worked overtime. The pressure became ""hellish,"" Mr. Burakov said, sitting in a small corner office still piled high with files and photos of the case. The case came to dominate his life and his health deteriorated. He worked almost without vacations or days off, often sleeping two, three hours a night. Gay Men Identified In 1986 he was hospitalized with insomnia and chest pains. Mr. Burakov's initial appeal to psychiatrists drew many hypotheses, often conflicting. They said the killer was young and strong, or homosexual, or a member of a Satanic cult, or a doctor, or more than one person. One result was that thousands of gay men were painstakingly identified in a state where homosexuality is still illegal. Twenty-five were imprisoned, most for soliciting minors. It was Mr. Bukhanovsky, a specialist in sexual pathology who was among the first Soviet psychiatrists to work with transsexuals, who eventually came closest to describing the person who was arrested in the killings. Pursuer Meets His Quarry He postulated a middle-aged man with an especially cruel childhood, a terrible inferiority complex and serious sexual problems, heterosexual, possibly married, who had probably been a teacher. He proved very close, though Citizen Ch. was finally captured less through the portrait than through painstaking detective work. Following the pattern of killings, the police staked out many potential murder sites and tried to steer the killer to more remote regions where he might stand out more clearly. It worked: after one killing, witnesses recalled seeing a boy following a lanky, middle-aged man with glasses. The break came on Nov. 6, 1990, when Citizen Ch. was identified at a spot where a victim was found soon after. A videotape of the arrest four days later shows him quietly submitting as detectives handcuff him. With his huge glasses, his sparse and tousled hair and his crooked posture, he appears meek and passive as the police book him and a doctor examines him. Mr. Burakov, who had so often lain awake imagining what the monster would look like, said he felt nothing when he finally saw him. ""I looked at him and I said, my God, is this what I lost eight years for?"" he said. Teacher and Active Communist For nine days after his arrest, Citizen Ch. would admit to nothing. Mr. Burakov called in Mr. Bukhanovsky to help, and when the psychiatrist read his portrait to the suspect, Citizen Ch. began to confess. He was 42 when he committed the first killing, he had learned as a child that an older brother was kidnapped and cannibalized during the great famine in Ukraine in the early 1930's, his father was a German prisoner-of-war who was treated as a traitor when he returned. He was often mocked and humiliated, and his early encounters with women were disastrous. But with time he married and had two children. He had worked as a teacher and later as a supply clerk in a factory, and he had been an active Communist Party member. ""I gave myself to my work, my studies, my family, my children, my grandchildren, and there was nothing else in my life,"" he wrote in a biographic essay written for Mr. Bukhanovsky in a scrawled hand. ""But when I found myself in a different setting, I became a different person, uncontrollable, as if some evil force controlled me against my will and I could not resist."" Mr. Bukhanovsky said, ""He feels no remorse for his victims, only pity for himself."" Citizen Ch. is currently in a K.G.B. isolation cell awaiting the start of the trial. A psychiatric board found him capable of standing trial and it is likely he will be sentenced to death. His wife and children, who insist he has been framed, have changed their names and residence.

"273","The Balkans Rapes: a Legal Test for the Outraged","EECA","Horrified by accounts of mass rapes in the ethnic fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina, women's advocacy groups and human rights groups are seeking legal avenues to stop the assaults and to prosecute those responsible as war criminals. The groups have formed the Ad Hoc Women's Coalition Against War Crimes in the former Yugoslavia, a group that now meets regularly to discuss how to put pressure on the international law system to bring people responsible for rape to justice. At the same time, the coalition is discussing how the violation of Balkan women is an exaggerated reflection of sexual violence against women worldwide, and how that pattern of behavior and attitudes about it can be changed. While rape by soldiers is as old as war itself, lawyers say, it has rarely been treated as a war crime or a human rights offense. But they say this conflict, in which Bosnian Serb soldiers are reportedly being ordered to rape Muslim women as part of a pattern of abuse aimed at driving them from their homes, may signal a change in attitudes toward wartime rape. ""In the past, rape as a tactical form of warfare has really been overlooked,"" said Dorothy Thomas, director of the Women's Rights Project of Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group that works with the coalition. ""We know it's happened almost everywhere, but only now is the message getting out that it is not acceptable -- that it's not booty. It's abuse."" Estimate of 20,000 Rapes Last week a fact-finding team of the European Community estimated that 20,000 Muslim women had been raped since the fighting began last April. The team, which visited Muslim refugees in Croatia, concluded that mass rapes there were a strategy of war and not just crimes of opportunity by individual soldiers. But even considering the enormity of the wrongdoing, as a legal matter, prosecution for war crimes is a difficult task. There is no international criminal court, and setting up a tribunal for war crimes, as the Allies did at Nuremberg after World War II, depends as much on favorable political winds as on legal precepts. So in addition to pressing the United Nations to create a tribunal to try such crimes in the former Yugoslavia and other Balkan nations, lawyers working with the women's coalition are exploring the idea of helping individual women file complaints under the Convention Against Torture, a treaty signed by Yugoslavia before its breakup in 1991. They said they were also considering the possibility of filing civil or criminal charges against wrongdoers when they come to the United States, using the concept of universal jurisdiction, which holds that certain crimes against humanity may be tried anywhere. Many women researching the law are frustrated by the knowledge that most traditional routes of international law lead at best to a formal declaration, long after the fact, that a wrong has occurred. It is usually impossible to intervene to stop the rapes or to win restitution for women who have been forced into prostitution or imprisoned until they bore children for the men who raped them. Women are said to be enduring both kinds of ordeals in the Balkans. ""We need this stopped while the war is going on, and that's what international law is worst at,"" said Catharine MacKinnon, a University of Michigan law professor working with Kareta, a Croatian women's group. Sending a Message Still, many human-rights advocates involved in the effort assert that it is important to seek international justice, even years after the fact, as a means of changing attitudes toward wartime rapes. ""It may seem frustratingly abstract in terms of what's happening to women, but it's crucial,"" said Rhonda Copelon, a law professor at the City University of New York who is working with the coalition. ""It sends a message that this can no longer be done with impunity, and it's important for the women in coming to terms with their experience."" The Geneva conventions, which provide for the humane treatment of civilians and the military in wartime, prohibits rape and enforced prostitution. And the conventions' list of ""grave breaches,"" that is, infractions serious enough to be tried as war crimes, includes torture or inhuman treatment and the willful ""causing of great suffering or serious injury to body or health."" Legal experts involved in the coalition's work said they believed that the language gives them the necessary tools to argue for a war crimes tribunal on rape. In the last international tribunal on war crimes, at Nuremberg, rape was not charged, according to Telford Taylor, the chief American counsel. Some legal experts suggest that this was not because of an absence of such atrocities but because of official inattention to them. A Violation of Rights Ms. MacKinnon and others contend that rape in the international context of war has been ignored in the same way that rape in the United States used to be all but ignored by prosecutors. Before the 1960's rape charges were seldom brought, mainly because prosecutors were disinclined to bring charges for a crime in which, in most cases, the offender is an acquaintance of the victim, and because strict legal requirements were in place concerning corroboration by a third party and the degree of resistance by the victim. ""The Geneva Convention covers rape, but it's one thing for there to be a statement that rape is a crime, and another for that to have any impact on the reality of women's lives when it's winked at, defined away and ignored,"" Ms. MacKinnon said. She contends that just as rape in the context of war is a violation of human rights, rape in a peacetime context should be seen as a civil rights violation. And she and others say they believe that rethinking wartime rape, so that it relates to peacetime rape, can benefit women long after the fighting in the Balkans ends. Indeed, the organizers of the women's coalition say the mass rapes in the Balkans have galvanized a wide assortment of groups who are concerned with women's rights and convinced that the violence against Bosnian women is not so far removed from rape in the United States. ""We're getting a lot of calls from women who work with rape crisis centers,"" said Marie Wilson of the Ms. Foundation for Women. ""They're horrified by the stories of mass rape, and they also see it as an opening to focus attention on how rape and violence work against women systematically, in this country, too, where the median age at which girls are sexually assaulted is 11 1/2, when they are just beginning to find their own voice."" Among the many other groups in the coalition are Equality Now, Amnesty International, the Fund for a Feminist Majority, Women's Action Coalition, the Center for Women's Global Leadership and the Center for Reproductive Policy and Law. On a separate track, at the United Nations, the accounts of atrocities in the Balkans have been so troubling that last October the Security Council created a five-member Commission of Experts to investigate reports of war crimes in the Balkans. Depending on its report, the Secretary General could ask the Security Council to establish a special tribunal on war crimes. Alternatively, the General Assembly could take action on longstanding proposals to create a permanent criminal international court to consider charges against Serbian soldiers. ""I think the momentum is there now for an ad hoc war crimes tribunal for Yugoslavia,"" said Cherif Bassiouni, a law professor at De Paul University who is the investigator for the Commission of Experts. Ms. Copelon and others say that even if the United Nations does not create a war crimes tribunal, charges can probably be brought against those responsible for the rapes through other routes. The most promising is probably the Convention against Torture, which provides for complaints by individuals. In theory, the Convention on Genocide can also be used if the rapes and forced pregnancies are shown to be a part of a plan to eliminate a group of people and if any nation brings such a complaint to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. But while the women's coalition can try to push international bodies to take action, the only legal weapon in their own hands is the filing of civil suits in this country. In those suits, the injured women can seek monetary damages from those who have wronged them and the sanctions can be taken whenever the wrongdoer sets foot in the United States. ""There is a notion of universal jurisdiction over those who violate the norms of international law, and we have used it successfully in the past,"" Ms. Copelon said. ""It's what we have used against some torturers, when they came to this country. It's what was used against Marcos.""",1993,"Serbia"
"274","Serbs Raped 20,000, EC Team Says; Assaults in Bosnia Part of 'Cleansing'","EECA","A European Community team of investigators has concluded that Serb forces have raped up to 20,000 Slavic Muslim women and girls in Bosnia as part of a systematic policy of terror designed to intimidate, demoralize and drive them from their homes. The Community's inquiry, the first official effort to collect evidence for a Nuremberg-like war crimes tribunal, was led by former British diplomat Anne Warburton and a former French health minister, Simone Veil, who is now a leading member of the European Parliament. They were accompanied by lawyers, forensic psychiatrists and experts in rape counseling. The group was assigned its task by the EC's 12 government leaders, who issued a harsh condemnation of these ""acts of unspeakable brutality"" at their summit meeting in Edinburgh, Scotland, last month. The EC investigators spent five days in Croatia in late December interviewing Muslim refugees. They also collated other eyewitness accounts, first gathered by the Red Cross and other humanitarian aid groups on the scene, that will serve as a body of evidence to bring the perpetrators of war crimes to justice. In their report, the investigators said they found that rape was occurring in Bosnia on a mass scale, not as random attacks but as part of a deliberate policy to build a Greater Serbia through ""ethnic cleansing"" -- the driving out of non-Serbs. ""A repeated feature of Serbian attacks on Muslim towns and villages was the use of rape, or the threat of rape, as a weapon of war to force the population to leave their homes,"" the delegation said in a five-page report. The investigators said ""rape is part of a pattern of abuse, usually perpetrated with the conscious intention of demoralizing and terrorizing communities, driving them from their homes and demonstrating the power of the invading forces."" ""Viewed in this way, rape cannot be seen as incidental to the main purpose of the aggression but as serving a strategic purpose in itself,"" the report said. While acknowledging that they had heard allegations of assaults against Croat and Serb women, as well as accounts of sexual abuse on men held in detention camps, the EC investigators said ""Muslim women undoubtedly form the vast majority of rape victims."" Although an exact number was difficult to quantify, they said, the most reasonable estimate was 20,000. They said Serb forces carried out the rapes of Muslim women ""in particularly sadistic ways to inflict maximum humiliation on the victims. Many women, and more particularly children, may have died during or after rape."" The delegation warned that many of the victims who did survive face the prospect of long-term psychological troubles that could lead to suicide unless they are given sensitive and sophisticated counseling. In addition, the investigators said governments should accelerate visa procedures to accommodate the victims as quickly as possible and to consider the best ways to prepare adoption channels since ""many of the women are not likely to wish to keep children conceived in such circumstances.""",1993,"Serbia"
"275","Rape and War Crimes","EECA","Three Croatian women's organizations have retained University of Michigan law professor Catharine A. MacKinnon to represent the Muslim and Croatian women who have been victims of sexual atrocities by Serbian nationalist forces before an international war crimes tribunal. The hiring of MacKinnon, widely regarded as the foremost American legal theorist in developing laws against pornography and rape, virtually guarantees that the victims of mass rapes and forced pregnancies will not have the crimes committed against them written off as yet another instance of ""war is hell."" Rapes and enforced prostitution are listed as war crimes under two of the protocols of the Geneva Convention, says MacKinnon. ""The only doubt is about implementation,"" she says. ""Will anyone do anything about it, and what will they do? In this instance, issuing reports is not satisfactory, and issuing reports is the primary means by which international law is enforced. ""One of the goals of my clients is to establish that rape is a violation of women's human rights, for peacetime as well,"" says MacKinnon, who is serving pro bono. ""The women in Croatia and Bosnia are very clear that this situation is both extreme and extraordinary, and at the same time everyday. ""What is clear here is that rape is a matter of policy. It is an expressed, ordered, integral aspect of the genocidal plan. What recognizing it as a human rights violation does is expand the notion of what human rights are to everyday atrocities that women experience, which are not usually as clear. Rape happens worldwide but it is overwhelmingly ignored. There is a policy of inaction toward it, a policy of tolerating it and a policy of having laws about it that are not enforced."" Bringing action on these rapes before an international tribunal would be an attempt to create a foundation for a broader legal treatment of rape as a human rights violation in peacetime as well as war. In an interview from Zagreb, Asija Armanda, an anthropologist who is a leader of Kareta, one of the Croatian women's groups that has retained MacKinnon, said no one knows how many women are still being held in what she called ""death rape camps"" and how many are still being subjected to ""masculine gender atrocities."" Some of the rape victims who have had babies ""are just giving the babies away,"" she said. She told of women in the camps who were beaten and left without food and water when their periods came, demonstrating that they had not become pregnant. . She said she and members of her organization did not believe the reports of mass rapes and forced pregnancies when they first surfaced in mid-1991. The rumors were confirmed in January and February of 1992, she says, when women in advanced stages of pregnancy began arriving in Croatian refugee camps. In the forthcoming issue of Ms. magazine, three teenage victims tell their stories: They are stories of being detained in humiliating circumstances, of being repeatedly raped and beaten and of seeing other young girls raped to death, ""slaughtered"" like cattle, as Mirsada, 17, puts it. ""There has not been a war where women have not been used as the envelope to carry the message from the conquering group of men to the conquered that 'you are so totally defeated this is what we are doing with your women,' "" says Robin Morgan, Ms. editor in chief. ""It isn't even anything aimed directly at the women. They are not considered that important. That's the horror of it."" Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, says one of its social workers was approached by a young man in a refugee camp who said he had escaped from a prison camp, then returned, only to discover his sister being raped and abused by Serbs. ""He said finally he just shot his sister to put her out of her misery.  He was extremely shaken by it."" Redmond stresses that officials have only just begun to document the extent of the atrocities. A European Community team of investigators reported last week that Serbs had raped more than 20,000 women and girls in Bosnia alone, not counting the Croatian women and Serbian women who have been raped. MacKinnon puts the total at more than 50,000 women and girls raped, and another 100,000 killed. ""We have reports of older Serbian women who took in Muslim children and said, 'These are my children,' "" she says. ""When they were exposed, their own children were killed."" These are stories that are one with the worst atrocities that came out of the Nazi concentration camps. ""Absolutely,"" says MacKinnon. ""Absolutely yes.""",1993,"Croatia"
"276","Bosnian Rapes Go Untried by the U.N.","EECA","In a well-guarded modern building here, stacks of folders stand as silent testimony to a rampage against women, telling of the large-scale and organized rape that soldiers inflicted during the Serbian ""ethnic cleansing"" of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Evidence of the magnitude of the abuse was so shocking that it persuaded the United Nations to identify systematic rape as a weapon of war and to include it among the crimes to be tried by the international community. Yet 18 months after the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal was established, it is proving difficult to turn the horror stories recounted by mainly Muslim girls and women into prosecution cases. Indeed, so far the tribunal has indicted just one man and his case does not include sexual abuse. Last year, a team of European Community investigators calculated that in 1992, some 20,000 Muslim women and girls, some as young as 10 years old, were raped by Bosnian Serb soldiers as part of a deliberate strategy to terrorize people, drive them from their homes and shatter communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other estimates are much higher. Many women told investigators they were raped in front of their husbands, parents or children, while many others said they were held in women's camps where they were abused night after night. The European investigators and Amnesty International reported that all three parties to the conflict, including Muslims and Croats, had sexually assaulted women, but Bosnian Serbs had been the main abusers. They said that men in detention camps had also been abused. At the tribunal's headquarters on the outskirts of The Hague, officials say a shortage of money and staff has slowed the pace of their work, leaving them waiting for new funds from the United Nations. Piles of evidence already gathered from refugees lie unsifted and untranslated. Richard Goldstone, the chief prosecutor, said his staff of 80 people required at least twice as many interpreters, secretaries, lawyers and investigators. The shortages affect all of the tribunal's activities, which include reviewing a long list of atrocities. But women's rights' groups, which have played a key role in bringing reports of systematic rape into the limelight, worry that foot-dragging may once again marginalize sexual crimes against women. These groups complain that so far the tribunal has not adequately prepared to deal with abuses against thousands of girls and women. And they note that the court is pitifully short of female experts, who are considered indispensable to the sensitive task of questioning victims and witnesses. ""For the victims it's important that prosecution happens as soon as possible and besides, rape is still going on,"" said Jacqui Hunt, a lawyer with the women's rights group Equality Now, based in New York. Justice Goldstone, a member of South Africa's Supreme Court who took up his post as chief prosecutor in August, agreed that the two women among the tribunal's eleven judges were not enough. ""Obviously I'd prefer there to be more women judges,"" he said. But he expects no changes on the panel named by the United Nations General Assembly. At present, of the tribunal's 22 lawyers, 8 are women; there are also only 3 women among the 18 investigators. ""We have insufficient women all around,"" Justice Goldstone added. ""We hope to correct that with the new hiring next year."" The war tribunal in The Hague will not be the first to hear charges of mass rape, but it is expected to deal with the issue more prominently than any before. ""Rape has never been the concern of the international community,"" said Justice Goldstone, who gained a reputation for independence while heading inquiries into political violence in South Africa. ""It's important that this be dealt with. My attitude is: The world does not learn from hiding unpleasant facts. If we are going to learn, we have to deal openly with these abuses.""",1994,"Bosnia"
"277","A Strange Bond: Officer's Widow And Air Hijacker","EECA","They are in their mid-40's, two American women whose destinies were fused in an instant 18 years ago by a terrorist's bomb. One, Kathleen Murray, is the widow of a New York City police officer who was killed while trying to deactivate the bomb. The other, Julienne Busic, is the convicted airline hijacker whose husband built the fatal device. The widow mourns Brian J. Murray, the father of their sons who were 2 and 4 years old when her husband was killed in September 1976. The hijacker longs for her husband, Zvonko Busic, a Croat who organized the hijacking to promote Croatian nationalism and is serving a life sentence at the Federal prison in Lewisburg, Pa. For three years before and three years after she was paroled from prison in 1989, Julienne Busic and Kathleen Murray corresponded, addressing each other as Kathie and Julie in a score of letters. They exchanged family photos and even met once. Zvonko Busic wrote, too. ""It was cathartic,"" said Mrs. Murray. ""I could say things to her that were pent up. I could tell her what I felt toward her."" According to a portion of the correspondence made available by Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Busic wrote about her husband's extremist activities on behalf of independence for Croatia, then one of six republics of Yugoslavia. She wrote about her family in Oregon; her father, a professor of classical Greek, and her mother, a librarian. ""We have a strange bond between us because of our husbands,"" she wrote in one letter. But the relationship cooled when Mrs. Busic appealed for help in getting her husband paroled from prison. And it ended when Mrs. Murray learned that Mrs. Busic had been hired in Washington by the embassy of the newly independent Croatia to handle cultural and press affairs. The widow said in a statement that she was ""outraged"" that a terrorist would be rewarded by such an appointment. The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association of New York has supported Mrs. Murray's position. The events dominating the women's lives were the commandeering of TWA Flight 355 shortly after it left La Guardia Airport on Sept. 10, 1976, and the placement of a bomb in Grand Central Terminal. The hijackers -- 5 of the 86 passengers aboard the flight to Chicago -- displayed what they said were bombs, which they threatened to detonate. They were made of Silly Putty. While the hijackers made their way to Europe, the New York City Police Department found a real bomb in a luggage locker in Grand Central. The hijackers had disclosed its location to strengthen the impression that they had ""five gelignite bombs"" on board the Boeing 727.  During an attempt to deactivate the bomb after it was removed from the terminal, it exploded, killing Officer Murray instantly and wounding three others. Upon learning this, the five hijackers surrendered at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris. In May 1977, they were convicted in Federal court in Brooklyn on charges of air piracy. Mr. and Mrs. Busic were also convicted of homicide. The Busics were sentenced to mandatory life terms. He was sent to Lewisburg; she was sent to a Federal prison in California. Ten years passed before Mrs. Busic struck the first note in the correspondence, writing on Oct. 20, 1987: ""It seems strange calling you by your first name, but Mrs. Murray seems strained as well, so, as we are about the same age, I hope you don't mind."" She said she wanted ""to try to explain how everything happened"" and added, ""How can saying how sorry I am ever be enough?"" She wrote again in November 1987, telling Mrs. Murray more about Zvonko Busic, saying she had decided she had ""a duty to stand by him"" in his extremist activities against Yugoslav diplomats in Europe and North America. ""I was in the position of not knowing what else he could possibly do, other than such a desperate act"" as the hijacking of TWA 355, Mrs. Busic wrote, adding, ""He is not a criminal in any sense of the word."" She then asked Mrs. Murray ""how you would feel about writing a letter on Zvonko's behalf"" to parole authorities. In March 1988, Mrs. Busic wrote more about Zvonko, saying she was overwhelmed from the start of their relationship by his supreme self-confidence: ""He was in control, nothing could go wrong if I trusted in him."" She described how she had surrendered her interests ""to his goals, which I felt were more noble and worthier than mine."" Once more she raised the idea of Mrs. Murray's writing to the parole authorities on behalf of Zvonko. The following December, Zvonko Busic wrote a rambling four-page letter to Mrs. Murray beginning with his philosophy that ""suffering is the best teacher."" ""Forgive me, but I must tell you I never felt guilty for your husband's death,"" but ""regretted it very much,"" he said. The correspondence discloses Julie's 1982 divorce from Zvonko and remarriage six years later, as well as Mrs. Murray's second marriage. It also reveals that at times their lives seemed to run on parallel courses: Each met her future spouse in 1969 -- Julie in Vienna, Kathleen in Brooklyn. Each wrote a manuscript on the hijacking case. Each obtained a master's degree, Julie in German, Kathleen in English. After her release on lifetime parole in 1989, Mrs. Busic journeyed to New York to meet Mrs. Murray. She brought gifts, which the widow rejected. The correspondence subsided after that. But in June 1993, Mrs. Busic wrote again seeking sympathy for her husband. In the interim, Croatia had declared itself independent from Yugoslavia in June 1991. Writing of Zvonko's reaction, Mrs. Busic said, ""He was first elated that his lifelong dream of an independent Croatia had come to pass and that he hadn't suffered all these years and sacrificed his freedom in vain."" On the other hand, she said, the home of his parents in the village of Gorica had been damaged by Serb attackers, as had the house of his sister. ""He sits and sits with no end in sight, and even worse, in the most dehumanizing of prisons, surrounded by every possible perversion and psychopathic behavior."" Again she asked Mrs. Murray to intercede on her husband's behalf, saying that under current conditions, he would only be paroled in the year 2006, at age 58. ""You would do the same for me in my place, I know in my heart,"" she wrote. Mrs. Murray replied coolly, recalling their previous correspondence: ""I rather enjoyed the opportunity to free myself of the hate that was eating at me for so long. It was not so easy, however, reconciling those feelings after we met in person. I felt used and manipulated."" She said she found it ironic that Zvonko's family has been affected by the very weapon he so callously devised and that ultimately brought an end to my husband's life. ""I certainly do not condone the violence in Croatia,"" she said, ""nor would I wish anyone harm, but I cannot absolve Zvonko. In the year 2006, I will still miss Brian and the life we were cheated out of. I've lived these years in my own prison, one from which I will never be released."" By this time, the new Croatian Government of President Franjo Tudjman had seen to it that the actions on behalf of Croats by Zvonko Busic and his relatives were acknowledged. His sister, Zdravka Busic, was appointed personal secretary of President Tudjman. Julienne Busic was given the title adviser by the Croatian Ambassador to the United States, Petar Sarcevic, and entrusted with handling much of the embassy's cultural and press affairs. She participated in meetings last month of Croatia's Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, with American reporters about the war in Bosnia. She remains on Federal probation under parole from a life sentence and is obliged to report monthly to a probation officer. ""She's clean from a legal point of view,"" said Mario Nobilo, the Croatian representative to the United Nations. ""She's paid her debt to society."" Asked about her work, Mrs. Busic said, ""I am not interested in talking about that,"" and declined comment. When Mrs. Murray learned of Mrs. Busic's embassy position, she issued a statement that said in part: ""Julienne Busic, an American who grew up in Portland, Ore., willingly took part in hijacking a TWA airliner and planting a bomb that blew up and killed my husband. I do not think she should be rewarded for her act of terrorism. The Croatian Embassy has embraced Mrs. Busic and compensated her for her loyalty."" Phil Caruso, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said: ""For the Croatian Government to literally condone murder and terrorism is appalling.  Our Government should sever diplomatic relations."" State Department officials concerned with Balkan affairs said they were unaware of Mrs. Busic's post at the Croatian Embassy. A senior official in the Chief of Protocol's office said that under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, every employee of a foreign embassy ""is supposed to be registered with the office of protocol, but it is hard for us to police it."" Mrs. Busic is not registered at the protocol office.",1994,"Croatia"
"278","...Around the World","EECA","In Geneva on March 4, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights broke precedent by appointing a ""special rapporteur"" -- an official monitor -- to gather documentation on violence against women. Last month a similar breakthrough occurred when, for the first time, the State Department in its annual report on human rights practices detailed international violence and discrimination against women. Last June in Vienna, representatives of 180 governments at the World Conference on Human Rights voted their approval of this pact: ""Gender-based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and exploitation ... must be eliminated. This can be achieved by legal measures and through national action and international cooperation in such fields as economic and social development, education, safe maternity and health care and social support."" Before heaping that onto the dull language pile, it's worth recalling that at least the talking stage has been reached. As recently as five years ago, none of the militant human rights groups -- Helsinki Watch, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch -- considered that women's human rights violations were sufficiently severe or numerous to be decried separately. In 1990 a shifting occurred when Human Rights Watch, Aryeh Neier's New York group, created an international women's rights project. In much of the world, abusing women is justified because the culture sanctions it: the male-dominated culture, to get it right. In Brazil, judicial leniency prevails in courts when men are prosecuted for killing their wives. Murders are often excused as ""privileged homicides,"" not intentional ones, because the husband caught his wife having an affair and had to kill her as a matter of honor. In the former Yugoslavia, Serbian soldiers rape as a routine policy of war and ethnic cleansing. Rape camps were established. A Croatian woman told human rights investigators of being impregnated in one camp by a reserve captain in the Serb militia and being lectured ""that I needed to give birth to a Serb -- that I would then be different."" In Thailand an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Burmese women and girls are believed to be held as prostitutes in ""debt bondage"" in brothels. The State Department reported in 1992 that Thai police can earn as much as $ 200 a month in protection fees -- protecting Thai brothel owners, not Burmese women. More than 2,000 Asian maids fled their violent Kuwait employers following the gulf war. Forced sterilizations or abortions in China, mandated virginity tests in Turkey, statutory sex discrimination in Poland, rape as a tactic of war in Peru and Pakistan, genital mutilation in more than 20 African countries, state-sanctioned discrimination in Saudi Arabia: These are a few of the abuses documented in the past four years by investigators of the women's rights project. Its reports rival those of Amnesty International for thoroughness and understated moral alarm. Much of the credit for creating the new visibility of violence to women goes to Dorothy Thomas, who persuaded Human Rights Watch to establish the women's rights project. She became its first director. Thomas, who is in her mid-thirties and did undergraduate and graduate work at Georgetown University, said in her Washington office the other afternoon that she has traveled the world for the past four years helping transform once underground or timid women's groups into political forces. In Pakistan, for one example of a success, she worked with women's groups to document that no police officer was ever criminally punished for sexually or physically abusing women held in custody, even though 70 percent of the detained suffered those assaults. Last month Thomas wrote to Secretary of State Warren Christopher asking what action he plans to take against the Thai government -- a U.S. aid recipient -- for its complicity in the sexual slavery of Burmese women. Christopher has called the promotion of women's human rights ""a moral imperative."" A heartened Thomas is wondering if that morality will find its way into the U.S. government's trade and financial relationship with Thailand and other international abusers of women. She is grateful for Christopher's words, but with no sign yet of follow-through action, her message to the human rights community is: Hold back the cheers for now.",1994,"Serbia"

But Athens newspapers panned the memoir, with the liberal daily Ethnos saying in a banner headline on page 1 that Ms. Liani had reduced a ""great leader to a soap opera star."" Ms. Liani, now 42, was an Olympic Airlines flight attendant when she met the married Mr. Papandreou on a flight. Their affair shocked the nation. He died last year at 77. History Revised Oliver Stone has apologized to the Syracuse Police Department again. The filmmaker, in Syracuse to publicize his novel ""A Child's Night Dream,"" said the police were wrongfully depicted in his 1989 film, ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" as brutalizing Syracuse University students during a 1970 anti-Vietnam War protest. Shortly after its release, Mr. Stone sent a letter to city officials, saying the police ""did not, in fact, hit any students over the head."" Thomas Sardino, then Police Chief, had threatened to take legal action against Universal Studios, which distributed the film. Shock of Recognition A film about a serial killer who preys on young women will not play in some theaters in a part of central Virginia where three girls were abducted and slain. Investigators believe the murders to be the work of a serial killer. RC Theaters, based in Reisterstown, Md., says it will not show ""Kiss the Girls"" in its Fredericksburg-area theaters after complaints from a resident that the movie strikes too close to home. In the film, based on a novel by James Patterson, Morgan Freeman stars as a Washington police detective whose niece has disappeared from college. When he arrives in Durham, N.C., to investigate, he learns that the police already are investigating the deaths of seven other young women and are searching for two more. ""Kiss the Girls"" is scheduled for national release on Friday, although it has had previews for several weeks. Of Man and Myth Hercules may be tough, but in the 20th century, he's only human.

"280","Bosnian Serb Trial Opens; First on Wartime Sex Crimes","EECA","The war crimes tribunal in The Hague took an important step in legal history today as it opened the first United Nations trial focusing exclusively on widespread sexual crimes against women during wartime. The trial is based on accusations that during the war in Bosnia, soldiers committed gang rape and forced women to act as prostitutes and individual domestic and sexual slaves. The women involved lived in Foca, a small town in southeastern Bosnia that was stormed by Bosnian Serb soldiers in the spring of 1992. No one has precise numbers on how many women were abused among Foca's 40,000 or so inhabitants, half of whom were Muslims. But in the coming weeks, 10 Muslim women from Foca are expected to testify on the atrocities they suffered while held captive during the summer and fall of 1992. The witnesses will come face to face with the three Bosnian Serb defendants, who have been charged with for crimes against humanity as well as violating the laws or customs of war. As the trial opened today, the three defendants, Dragoljub Kunarac, Radomir Kovac and Zoran Vukovic, stared blankly ahead or sometimes looked at their video terminals while maps of the area and photographs of places identified as ""rape camps"" and ""quasi-brothels"" were shown. All three defendants have denied the charges. Although none of the victims were present, an unusually large number of women were in court today. The president of the three-judge panel is a woman, Florence Mumba. Both the prosecution and the defense attorney teams include women. And behind the thick glass wall of the public gallery, female lawyers and representatives of women's groups listened attentively. ""What happens here is tremendous progress,"" said Kelly Askin, an American legal scholar and author of the book, ""War Crimes Against Women."" ""Some 200,000 women who were forced into sexual servitude by the Japanese in World War II never had any redress. Now we are seeing tremendous improvement in the jurisprudence for women."" Presenting the case, Dirk Ryneveld, a prosecutor, said, ""This is a case about rape camps in Eastern Bosnia, whose uncovering in 1992 shocked the world. This is a case about the women and girls -- some as young as 12 or 15 years old --who endured unimaginable horrors as their worlds collapsed around them."" The crimes, he said, were an intrinsic part of the Serbian ""ethnic cleansing campaign"" against the Muslims of Bosnia, and he said that some of the soldiers told their victims that they would now bear Serbian babies. In his 38-page statement the prosecutor cited many examples of abuse. The lowest estimates made by research groups hold that during the conflicts that followed the breakup of the Communist-era Yugoslavia, 20,000 women were raped, most of them Muslims. http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Bosnia"
"281","THE WORLD; In Romania, Playboy's 'Joke' Backfires","EECA","WHILE Playboy magazine has never exactly been a feminist publication, it has never been known for advocating wife beating. At least until now. The April issue of the Romanian edition of the magazine, published locally under a licensing arrangement with Playboy Enterprises, outraged women's groups in Eastern Europe by its inclusion of an article, apparently intended as an April Fool's joke, titled ""How to Beat Your Wife . . . Without Leaving Marks on Her Body."" The article describes how to commit spousal battery, accompanied by pictures of a woman being beaten by a man in a police uniform. ""You have decided to beat her up, then do it,"" the article reads, urging husbands to ""hit hard and steady, since you don't know when you will have a second chance."" Afterward, it continued, ""you will notice that the wife sometimes wants to be beaten again."" Women's organizations based in Romania spoke up in protest. ""We think this article is a clear incitement to conjugal violence,"" read a statement that was signed by 14 groups, including the Foundation for an Open Society, the Fulbright Commission, the Civic Education Project-Romania and the Foundation for Equal Opportunities to Women. Christie Hefner, the chairwoman and chief executive of Playboy Enterprises, said that the article was not indicative of Playboy's attitude toward women, and that the editor was reprimanded. ""This article flies in the face of Playboy's 46-year history of strongly opposing any visual or editorial depiction of violence toward women,"" she said in a statement. ""We do not condone it and will not tolerate it.""

"282","3 SERBS CONVICTED IN WARTIME RAPES","EECA","In its first trial dealing exclusively with sexual violence, the United Nations war crimes tribunal today found three former Bosnian Serb soldiers guilty of raping and torturing Muslim women and girls. It also convicted two of the three men of enslaving their captives, the first time that an international tribunal has prosecuted and condemned sexual slavery. The charges stem from events in 1992 and 1993, during the early part of the Bosnian conflict, after Bosnian Serb forces seized the town of Foca, southeast of Sarajevo. The court said that the two convicted of slavery had kept their captives, some as young as 12, for up to eight months, abusing them sexually, forcing them to do domestic work for their captors, and renting and selling them to other soldiers. The verdict, read by Judge Florence Mumba of Zambia, also defined rape for the first time as a crime against humanity, one of the most heinous crimes. The tribunal has previously tried cases involving rape, but defined the rape as torture.  And after World War II, only slave labor was prosecuted as slavery; the Japanese military's use of ""comfort women"" as sex slaves never came before an international tribunal. Prosecutors said they were satisfied with the convictions. ""The judgment makes clear that slavery means not only slave labor but that it can also be sexual slavery,"" said Peggy Kuo, one of the prosecutors and a lawyer from the Justice Department in the United States. ""We are pleased with the court's decision because the sentences showed that the court took the crimes very seriously."" The sentences were handed down in a hushed courtroom by a three-judge panel, before an overflowing public gallery. Many other visitors followed the proceedings by looking at monitors elsewhere in the building on the outskirts of The Hague. Dragoljub Kunarac, 40, a former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment. Radomir Kovac, 39, a former paramilitary commander, was sentenced to 20 years. Both men were accused of multiple rapes, torture and enslavement. Zoran Vukovic, 39, also a former paramilitary commander, was given 12 years for rape and torture. As Judge Mumba's words rang through the court, the three men sat stone-faced in the dock. Representatives of women's groups, which have played an important role in pressing the tribunal to prosecute war crimes, were elated. ""I'm so glad, we've been waiting so long for such clear language and convictions,"" said Gabriela Mischkowski, a founder of Medica Mondiale, a German-based support group for women who have suffered trauma in war. Legal scholars said that the judgment is likely to set new standards for trials at this tribunal and elsewhere. They said it will almost certainly influence rules for the new, permanent international criminal court and possibly national legal systems as well, as did decisions of the Nuremberg trials after World War II. Military officers who deal with codes governing the conduct of war are certain to be informed of this decision, lawyers said. Women's groups have argued that male historians have tended to describe mass rape, along with pillage, as an inevitable aspect of war. It was the pressure of women's groups that drew attention to the abuse of women in wartime Bosnia. Activists from Europe and the United States also lobbied experts preparing the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in Geneva, ensuring that rape would be prosecuted as part of war crimes. In their summary, the judges did not use the terms ""sexual slaves,"" as prosecutors had during the trial, to describe the prolonged abuse of the girls and women of Foca. The crime of enslavement appears in the tribunal's statutes, but the charge of sexual slavery does not formally exist. As she described the enslavement of four young Muslim girls by one of the accused, Mr. Kovac, Judge Mumba said the girls were handed over or sold to other soldiers, beaten, poorly housed and fed, and ""had to obey every order and do whatever they were told to do, including the cooking and household chores."" ""It's clearly a milestone in the recognition of wartime violence against women,"" said Kelly Askin, author of the book ""War Crimes Against Women."" But she said she was troubled that the ruling had not defined sexual enslavement more explicitly. ""The women were enslaved so they could be raped, not vice versa,"" she said. ""The definition of enslavement did not make that clear enough."" The ruling, however, described the individual and mass rapes in Foca in numerous ways. In her summary, Judge Mumba said the Bosnian Serb armed forces used rape ""as an instrument of terror."" Investigators of the European Union and many human rights groups who went to Bosnia in 1992, after the first reports of mass rape became known, said that rape was often used in the Balkan conflict as a tactic of intimidation and weapon of war. They said that all three parties to the conflict -- Muslims and Croats as well as Serbs -- had committed sexual abuses, but that Serbs in Bosnia had been the main perpetrators. The European investigators calculated that in 1992 alone, some 20,000 Muslim women and girls were raped by Serbs. The tribunal has not mentioned any numbers. In Foca in 1992, hundreds of women were believed to have been raped, of whom 16 came to the tribunal to testify. Some had not told their story before, prosecutors said. The victims testified behind blinds, their voices altered, but in the courtroom they faced their tormentors and identified them. Prosecutors said they knew of many more cases of rape in Foca, but some women refused to testify, and others could not be contacted. In her summary, Judge Mumba frequently berated the accused first as a group, then individually. To Mr. Kunarac, who was accused of rape and of providing the men of his unit with women, she said: ""You were a soldier with courage in the field, somebody whom your men undisputedly are said to have held in high esteem. Your active participation in this nightmarish scheme of sexual exploitation is therefore even more repugnant."" At one point, after a young woman was raped by two soldiers and ""you were raping her,"" Judge Mumba said, ""you further mocked the victim, saying that she would carry Serb babies and that she would not know the father."" The three defendants were not among the political or military masterminds behind the conflicts and atrocities, the ruling said, noting however that such leaders are rendered powerless if ordinary people refuse to carry out criminal activities in the course of war. And, Judge Mumba said, even ""lawless opportunists should expect no mercy, no matter how low their position in the chain of command may be."" She added, ""In time of peace as much as in time of war, men of substance do not abuse women.""",2001,"Bosnia"

"284","U.N. Must Fight Slavery, From Bosnia to Sudan","EECA","To the Editor: The conviction by a United Nations war crimes tribunal of former Bosnian Serb soldiers for enslaving and raping Muslim women is a watershed (front page, Feb. 23). While slavery and the slave trade are outlawed in many international treaties, millions live in bondage. The United Nations tribunal must act against slavery and gang rape wherever they occur. One glaring example is southern Sudan, where gang rape of women and girls during slave raids is common. Many teenage girls who have been liberated recount being repeatedly raped by government-backed militiamen. Yet the testimony of these young women is generally met with silence. Just because the victims are not white Europeans does not mean that we can ignore their plight. The landmark ruling at The Hague should be but the start of a persistent campaign against slavery around the world.

"285","Ideas & Trends: Crimes Against Humanity; A New Legal Weapon to Deter Rape","EECA","WHEN Judge Florence Mumba of Zambia confronted three Bosnian Serbs at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague last month and convicted them of rape and sexual enslavement, she dismissed two excuses that soldiers have used through the ages: ""boys will be boys"" and ""I was only following orders."" For the first time, a war crimes tribunal ruled that rape was a crime against humanity, and did not have to be ordered from above to rise to that highest level of atrocity. ""Lawless opportunists,"" Judge Mumba said, ""should expect no mercy, no matter how low their position in the chain of command may be."" In fact, she added, rape did not have to be perpetrated in time of war to be a punishable offense. ""In time of peace as much as in time of war, men of substance do not abuse women,"" she said. Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state, who as the American representative at the United Nations pushed for the creation of war crimes tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda, and also pushed for more attention to crimes against women, called the judgments ""a huge deal."" Rape, she said, ""is a weapon of war, and to have that recognized was a very big step forward."" After the United Nations, in the mid-1990's, set up the first international war crimes courts in half a century, it made the crucial decision to expand the list of crimes to include abuses of women. What Judge Mumba and her panel have now done is to demonstrate that these crimes can be prosecuted successfully. Gauging the eventual practical impact of that precedent is more difficult. According to Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on the United Nations and international law who teaches at the Yale Law School, the Hague decisions can be expected to encourage more prosecutions. Those decisions, she said ""could mean that in the future, women's cases will get more resources, and attention to gender balance on tribunals, a sufficient number of women in prosecutors' offices and dealing sensitively with rape victims."" ""But this is more iconographic, more emblematic, than it is a legal change,"" she continued. In fact, she pointed out, rape has been identified as a war crime since the American Civil War, when Francis Lieber included it in his code of conduct for the Union Army. It was also mentioned in the 1949 Geneva Conventions (but demurely, as an ""outrage upon personal dignity"" in civil wars). But prosecution of this crime, as of all war crimes, has always been the problem. Typically the military officers who commanded the offenders also made decisions about whom to charge, and that has often meant an unenthusiastic prosecution, or none at all. On the other hand, international judgments, like those from Nuremberg and Tokyo in the 1940's, do set standards of international acceptability, to which all nations are then expected to adjust the conduct of their troops. In that context, Ms. Wedgwood was struck by the message sent in convicting men who were not committing the kind of large-scale abuses that until now have defined crimes against humanity. ""They've not been charged with the abuse of 10,000 women,"" she said. ""They were not like the commander of the entire comfort-women enterprise of the Japanese Army."" She said that the ordinariness of the men ""makes the conviction more significant."" Some analysts argue that in the half- century since the war crimes tribunals in Germany, profound changes in the social as well as legal atmosphere helped make this new verdict possible. As women's movements have reduced squeamishness about discussing rape and other sexual abuses, women have slowly become braver in bringing evidence to tribunals, not only in the Balkans but also in Africa. There have also been convictions involving rape at the war crimes tribunal for Rwanda, but only under the umbrella of broader criminal definitions like torture. THE new atmosphere of openness and determination among women to press for attention to crimes against them has had effects in many areas. In East Timor, for example, where evidence is now unfolding of rape and sexual enslavement on a mass scale by pro-Indonesian militias, a special office for women's issues is part of the United Nations administration now governing the territory, and more attention is being paid to women in refugee camps, where they are almost always vulnerable to abuse. Ms. Wedgwood said the United Nations might heed the message of the trial and begin to take more responsibility for abuses committed by peacekeeping troops sent out under its flag. Under present rules, peacekeepers charged with rape or other offenses are still turned over to their national governments and sent home, not always to punishment. Looking back over the last decade, some legal experts are surprised at the speed with which the war crimes tribunals have expanded new fields of law governing military behavior, helping to lay a strong foundation for a permanent international court now being considered by the United Nations. ""The whole war crimes operation has gone a lot farther and a lot faster than anybody ever thought when the United States early in the Clinton administration first came out for setting up the tribunals,"" said Warren Zimmerman, who was the American ambassador to Yugoslavia as it was splintering a decade ago. Since then, he said, not only has it been proved that Balkan war criminals can be caught but also ""the whole definition of what's accountable before this court has been broadened.""",2001,"Bosnia"
"286","Russian Riot Grrrls Jailed for 'Punk Prayer'","EECA","The Russian protest leader Aleksei Navalny ridiculed the authorities on Wednesday for jailing two young mothers suspected of belonging to a feminist punk band inspired by the American riot grrrl movement. The two women, Maria Alyokhin and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, were arrested on the eve of Sunday's presidential election as part of an investigation into Pussy Riot, an all-female band of activists formed late last year. During the election campaign, the group staged a number of provocative performances in public spaces, culminating in a ""punk prayer service"" last month on the altar of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow. As a recording of that performance posted on the group's YouTube channel shows, five members of the band, wearing brightly colored balaclavas, burst into the cathedral to sing an obscene anthem punctuated with three cries of, ""Holy Mother, send Putin packing!"" Readers who want to guard their ears against the song's Russian obscenities, can view a copy of the video with the sound turned down as the expletives fly. The band managed to escape the cathedral on Feb. 21 without being arrested, but the police detained several suspected members over the weekend. All but two of the detainees were released pending trial. As the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported, ""The church demanded the criminalization of blasphemy following the incident. Legislators did not react, but a criminal case was opened on hooliganism charges, punishable with up to seven years in prison."" In a blog post on Wednesday, Mr. Navalny mocked both the band's protest and the idea that the suspects are so dangerous that they must be held in pretrial detention until a hearing scheduled for late April. ""Their action at Christ the Savior Cathedral is idiotic, and there is nothing to argue about. To put it mildly, I would not like it if some cranky chicks broke into a church while I was there and started running around the altar,"" Mr. Navalny wrote, according to the Interfax news agency. ""Is their offense so publicly dangerous to keep them behind bars? Obviously not. Are there circumstances ruling out keeping them in detention? Obviously yes,"" he added. A lawyer for the two detained women told the Russian news site Gazeta.ru that they should be entitled to release on bail, since they pose no flight risk and are the mothers of young children. Photographs of Ms. Tolokonnikova with her 4-year-old daughter and Ms. Alyokhin with her 5-year-old son were posted on the Pussy Riot blog and Twitter feed. Although it is not clear if she is a member of Pussy Riot, since the women have insisted on preserving their anonymity by wearing balaclavas even during interviews, Ms. Tolokonnikova has been associated in the past with a radical art collective, Voina, which tweaked the authorities by claiming responsibility for setting a police van on fire in January. More photographs of the women behind bars were posted on a Twitter feed attributed to Ms. Tolokonnikova and a male artist who was also once part of the activist art group. In an interview with Gazeta.ru's English-language Web site last week, members of the band explained that they got together last year because ""Russia did not have enough explosive punk-feminist groups, pushing people to the development of a culture of protest."" The women, who described themselves as ""activists of the opposition movement, dealing with the problems of feminism, ecology, as well as rights for the L.G.B.T. movement,"" added that the group's name ""was inspired by the famous punk-feminist movement called Riot Grrrl which was active in America in 1990s. Their ideas were close to ours."" The point of staging unauthorized concerts in unusual locations -- before the cathedral, there were performances in the center of Red Square, outside a prison and in a subway station -- the women explained, was to present an image of ""pure protest, saying: super heroes in balaclavas and acid bright tights seize public space in Moscow."" Mr. Navalny, a lawyer known for his anticorruption crusades, reminded his readers that the Russian legal system was far more lenient in a recent case involving an election commissioner's daughter. ""She ran over two people -- one of them died and the other was maimed,"" Mr. Navalny wrote. ""She was not arrested,"" before her trial he added, ""and was sentenced to three years in a settlement colony, with the sentence suspended for 14 years until her young child grows up."" By contrast, Mr. Navalny noted, the accused members of Pussy Riot have been ordered to stay behind bars for 60 days, ""during an investigation into an offense which obviously cannot be punished harsher than five days of arrest. Let them mop the square around Christ the Savior Cathedral and think about their behavior. This is senseless and horrible cruelty, which is much worse than their very stupid but small offense."" The blogger, who describes himself as a Christian, concluded by calling on the Russian Orthodox Church to ""display mercy and forgive the silly girls, ask for their immediate release before trial, and hold an educative conversation with them when they are released and return them to their young children.""",2012,"Russia"

"288","Outraged by Fatal Assault on Young Woman, Ukrainians Force an Investigation","EECA","MOSCOW -- The crime was shocking enough: an 18-year-old woman gang-raped, half strangled, set on fire and left for dead. But what sent hundreds of Ukrainians into the streets and rushing to her hospital to give blood this month was a police decision to free two suspects rumored to be politically connected. The uproar has shaken the upper echelons of Ukraine's government. On Thursday, three weeks after the attack, the young woman died. Viktor F. Yanukovich, the president, and Nikolai Azarov, the prime minister, were among the first to offer condolences -- along with vows that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. ''I will press law enforcement agencies to investigate and obtain a just punishment,'' Mr. Azarov wrote on his blog. ''No compromises. Only with the knowledge that punishment is inevitable will these monsters fear to encroach on people's lives and rights.'' Whether they will succeed in calming the outrage is unclear. Doctors said the young woman, Oksana Makar, suffered serious burns to about 55 percent of her body and had severe internal injuries. One of her arms was amputated. She was able to give at least one videotaped interview, her blond hair matted and blue eyes straining against what she described as excruciating pain. For Ukrainians transfixed by her ordeal, she came to embody long-simmering animosities over government impotence and impunity for the privileged in this former Soviet nation. It was only after the street protests and Mr. Yanukovich's personal intervention that the police in the small southern town of Nikolayev re-arrested the young men. On Thursday, they and a third jailed suspect were officially charged with murder. The men met Ms. Makar at a cafe in Nikolayev on the evening of March 9, according to prosecutors. After a few drinks, she agreed to go with them back to one of their apartments. They continued to drink. At some point, Ms. Makar complained of not feeling well and went to lie down in the bedroom. ''After that they came to their criminal intention: to rape her,'' Yuri V. Boychenko, a spokesman for the prosecutor general's office, said by telephone. ''After they committed this act, they were worried that she would go to the police, and to avoid this -- all were in a state of intoxication -- took further steps.'' The men, he said, tried to strangle Ms. Makar with a cord, leaving her barely conscious. Then they wrapped her in a blanket and dragged her to a nearby construction site, where they set her on fire. She was discovered the next morning, still conscious, by a passing motorist. It is not clear why the police initially freed two of the suspects. Investigators maintain that they lacked enough evidence to hold them. Rumors quickly spread that the parents of the two, both in their 20s, had ties to the local government. Officials confirmed that one, Maksim Prisyazhnyuk, is the adopted son of a former chairwoman in a regional legislature. The perception that the men were released because of political connections touched a nerve. Ukrainian tabloids are filled with the exploits of the so-called mazhory, the children of the wealthy and powerful who can seem impervious to punishment. Hundreds marched to the local prosecutor's office demanding punishment. Some called on the government to reinstate the death penalty as in Soviet times and execute the men, according to local media reports. After the public outcry, Mr. Yanukovich directed Ukraine's prosecutor general, Viktor Pshonka, to open an inquiry. It found that the police had acted carelessly. Several officials in the local prosecutor's office and police departments involved in the case were fired and others were demoted. Asked in a videotaped interview shortly before her death what she wanted to say to her attackers, Ms. Makar, visibly straining against the pain, said she hoped they would be raped in prison.",2012,"Ukraine"
"289","Punk Band Feels Wrath of a Kremlin Running Low on Tolerance","EECA","MOSCOW -- When four young women in balaclavas performed a crude anti-Putin song on the altar of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in February, it seemed like just one more episode in a season of audacious, absurdist and occasionally offensive protest. Instead, the case of the young punk rockers, whose group is called Pussy Riot, is becoming a bellwether event in the Russian capital, signaling an end to the chilly tolerance the Kremlin displayed in response to the winter's large demonstrations. The three women arrested after the performance have been held in custody for more than four months, a term that was extended on Friday by six months, through next January. They could be sent to prison for seven years. Preliminary hearings in the case offered some of the most striking courtroom images since the trial of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, which took place in the same building. While that case tested Russians' feelings toward a billionaire businessman, this one picks as its targets slender young women with hooded sweatshirts and Twitter accounts -- avatars of the protest movement itself. Stanislav O. Samutsevich, 73, whose daughter is one of the defendants, said that he was appalled when he heard of her performance in the church, but that the government's response was so disproportionate that he had changed his mind. ''They led the girls into the courtroom in handcuffs -- these small girls are led in, and they are half the size of the officers,'' Mr. Samutsevich said, his voice tremulous, as he waited outside the courtroom. ''There is something especially disturbing about it for me. It seems absurd.'' The criminal prosecution of the three women -- Maria Alyokhina, 24; Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23; and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29 -- rests on the notion that their performance incited religious hatred. That argument is supported by Orthodox activists who say the women are Satanists. Ten witnesses have said they suffered ''moral damage'' as a result and are considered victims in the court proceeding, as is standard in Russia. One, a cathedral security guard, ''had trouble sleeping after the crime in the cathedral,'' said his lawyer, Mikhail Kuznetsov, in an interview with the newspaper Moskovskiye Novosti. The band, Mr. Kuznetsov said, ''is only a tiny visible tip of the iceberg of extremists who are trying to destroy the thousand-year-old basis of the Russian Orthodox Church, provoking a schism, and using lies to lead the flock not to God but to Satan.'' ''Behind this stand the real enemies of both our state and Orthodoxy,'' the newspaper quoted Mr. Kuznetsov as saying. It said he added that activities like the performance at the cathedral ''could soon grow into events comparable to the explosion of the twin towers in America.'' In court on Friday, lawyers for the victims argued that the Feb. 21 performance had unleashed a wave of extremism that culminated in a terrorist attack on two Muslim leaders in Tatarstan on Thursday, defense lawyers said. The government picked a ripe opportunity to crack down, since many Russians found the cathedral performance offensive. It took months for the case to provoke support for the women, even in the opposition-minded city of Moscow. But the balance seemed to shift last month, when a roster of famous artists and musicians, including some vocal supporters of Mr. Putin, signed a petition contending that the case ''compromises the Russian judicial system and undermines trust in the authorities.'' A poll released on Friday by the independent Levada Center found that a substantial proportion of Muscovites, 37 percent, took a positive view of the prosecution, and 50 percent had a negative view. ''When it began to turn into this fantastic biblical story, social attitudes toward the girls changed radically,'' said Marat Guelman, a former political consultant and gallery owner whose projects have been denounced by religious activists. ''Most of the population now are not so much talking about what Pussy Riot did as much as their fear that these people who want to introduce some kind of Orthodox Taliban to Russia, that they will take power,'' Mr. Guelman said. ''So now I think the authorities are making a big mistake, taking revenge in this way. Society will not support this.'' Whether he is right will become clear only gradually, as state-controlled television reports on the prosecution of the three women, two of them mothers of small children. So far, the case has aroused intense interest only on the extremes of the political spectrum, a fact reflected on Friday outside the courthouse, where protesters wearing white ribbons tried to shout down Orthodox activists carrying Bibles. ''We are seeing an attempt to return the country not to the Soviet period, but to the 17th century,'' said Lev Rubinstein, a poet who spent much of the morning there. Andrei Damer, an Orthodox missionary, said the performance had crossed the line that separated political speech from blasphemy. ''One can criticize the authorities, but one cannot scold the authorities like these girls did,'' Mr. Damer said. ''From God's point of view, where they are now is just.'' Friday's hearing was closed to the public, but defense lawyers said court officials had brought a Rottweiler into the courtroom and scolded them for posting updates on Twitter, a fact that was apparently noted by prosecution lawyers monitoring the social media site. The defense filed a motion requesting that Patriarch Kirill I and President Vladimir V. Putin testify in court. ''As Mr. Putin in a decisive manner influences the decision of this court, it would be proper from the legal standpoint to interrogate him,'' said Mark Feigin, one of the lawyers. Pyotr Verzilov, Ms. Tolokonnikova's husband, said his wife had long understood that public protests carried serious risks in Russia. Both of them were active in Voina, a radical art collective that gained widespread popularity recently with a series of politically tinged actions, like a punk-rock performance in a Moscow courtroom, or a 210-foot penis painted, guerrilla-style, on a St. Petersburg drawbridge, so that it rose up pointing at the offices of the F.S.B., the state security service. But the penalties had turned out to be mild; the penis project actually won a contemporary art prize sponsored by the Ministry of Culture. Neither Mr. Verzilov nor his wife thought the authorities would react so harshly this time, he said. He took the couple's 4-year-old daughter, Gera, to a hearing this month when it was rumored that the three women might be released. On Friday, he went without her. ''She understands what is happening,'' he said. ''She tells everyone that Putin put Mother in a cage and now we have to fight so that they'll let her out.''",2012,"Russia"
"290","Unruly Proceedings in Trial Of Russian Punk Group","EECA","MOSCOW -- A day after President Vladimir V. Putin appeared to urge leniency in the trial of three young women who staged a ''punk prayer'' in Moscow's main church, the prosecution rested its case after showing the judge the dark blue balaclavas that the band members wore during demonstrations. As the trial lurched through a fifth day of unruly proceedings, demonstrators outside the courthouse added to the arguments among increasingly exasperated lawyers. A police dog, a Rottweiler, even spent most of the day barking in the courtroom. On Friday afternoon, three protesters in balaclavas scaled a three-story building adjacent to the court and set off flares as they chanted for the members of the band, called Pussy Riot, to be released. Police officers who climbed up after them seemed at a loss as to what to do. Eventually, they tied the protesters to the roof, and later brought them down with a cherry picker. Meanwhile, several opposition figures, including the anticorruption blogger Aleksei Navalny, were briefly kept out of the court and then prevented from testifying, despite being called by the defense as expert witnesses. Since the trial opened on Monday, the courtroom proceedings have been punctuated by various disturbances. On Thursday, a man phoned the courthouse and said, ''The building is mined,'' sending court officials, lawyers and journalists spilling onto the street. Canine units and firefighters were called in but found nothing. On Wednesday, ambulances were called twice after defense lawyers said their clients, who are being held in a glass enclosure in court -- often referred to here as the ''aquarium'' -- were suffering from ''fatigue'' and ''extremely low blood sugar.'' Paramedics examined the three, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Maria Alyokhina, 24, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29, and pronounced them fit to stand trial. By Friday evening, the defense team had demanded for the sixth time that Judge Marina Syrova recuse herself. Judge Syrova denied the requests and continued to move the trial forward, with no visible sign that Mr. Putin's remarks had influenced the court. At times the trial has deteriorated into personal attacks between Judge Syrova and the defense. Mr. Putin's comments in London that the women should not be judged severely for the February protest did little to convince relatives that they would be released. ''It means they'll get five years instead of seven,'' said Pyotr Verzilov, the husband of Ms. Tolokonnikova. With the court working unusually late on Friday, defense lawyers carried out an impromptu filibuster until the court closed for the weekend, filing 10 successive appeals to hear testimony from experts who had analyzed videos of the performance. The prosecution accused the defense of stalling, as the judge appeared bored. ''Are you drawing circles?'' the defense lawyer Violetta Volkova asked Judge Syrova, who replied, ''Are you forbidding me to do so?''",2012,"Russia"

"292","Anti-Putin Hackers Seize Moscow Court's Web Site, Posting Calls to 'Free Pussy Riot'","EECA","MOSCOW - Hackers briefly seized control Monday of the Web site of the Moscow district court that sentenced three members of the feminist protest band Pussy Riot to two years in a penal colony last week. For three hours on Tuesday morning, Khamovnichesky Court's usually static Web site was enlivened with a recording of the new Pussy Riot song, ""Putin Is Lighting the Fires of Revolution,"" and an embedded copy of a music video for a song called ""Hate,"" by the Bulgarian gay icon Azis. The video was described as ""a rather sleazy and erotic gay clip,"" by the Russian news site Gazeta.ru. A headline across the top of the site read, ""Putin's Thieving Gang Is Robbing Our Country! Wake Up, Comrades!"" The site's navigation tabs were altered, and other text was added to display slogans including, ""Free Pussy Riot,"" and, ""Judges - I'd have executed them all."" A video report on the hacking by the Russian business news channel RBC showed a message from the hackers in which they claimed to be part of ""American Anonymous,"" referring to a loose collective of hackers (not usually identified as American) known for revenge attacks on the Web sites of organizations and states perceived as enemies of free speech. According to a BBC News report, the hackers also wrote: ""We don't forget and we don't forgive,"" and, ""The justice system has to be transparent."" The hackers were apparently encouraged to attack the site early on Tuesday by an anonymous user of the Web forum 2ch.so - the Russian equivalent of the message board 4chan. At 6:17 a.m., a message was posted on the board with the login and password information needed to access the Web site's back end, along with a username and password that granted access to the court's e-mail in-box. Within minutes, gleeful 2ch users began posting screen shots of their progress in defacing the hacked Web site and discussing what video might be the most (in)appropriate to display. Soon, a Twitter account linked to the Russian arm of Anonymous posted a link to archived copies of messages apparently taken from one of the court's e-mail in-boxes. An analysis of the archive by the Moscow bureau of The New York Times shows that the vast majority of the 487 messages were e-mails sent to the court from users of the Web site Change.org. Last week, the site promised to deliver a ""Free Pussy Riot!"" petition signed by more than 136,000 people to the court and to officials including Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. Officials regained control of the site later on Tuesday, and Darya Lyakh, a spokeswoman for the court, told the Russian news agency Interfax that the hacking had been carried out ""by people with bad imaginations."" One of Pussy Riot's lawyers, Mark Feygin, wrote on Twitter, ""Of course I do not approve of hacking attacks, but cannot hide genuine admiration for the daredevils from Anonymous. If they arrest them, I will defend them.""

"293","Trial by Video","EECA","BEREZNIKI, Russia - ""I can barely see you,"" the young woman on the videoscreen said, her high-pitched voice trembling. ""You are just a dark silhouette. And I cannot see or hear the defense or the prosecution at all."" ""You can hear us,"" the judge nodded, writing something in her notepad. The woman on the screen was Maria Alyokhina, one of the two members of the punk rock group Pussy Riot who are serving two-year sentences in Russian penal colonies. Alyokhina has been held in a women's colony here  in Berezniki since early November, and in that time she has clocked a whopping four violations. She appealed the violations: If they are overturned, she will, at least on paper, have a chance at parole in September; otherwise she will stay behind bars until March 2014. Appeals such as Alyokhina's are normally heard inside the penal colony by judges who come out to hear several such cases in a day. Each case is usually heard in less than half an hour and court generally upholds the colony's position. But Alyokhina's support team, a ragtag group of friends, relatives and former strangers who flocked to the group after their performance at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior last February, pressured the court to open the hearing to the public - and succeeded, with one important caveat they had not foreseen: Alyokhina herself was not transported to the hearing, but rather was connected by video. The violations with which Alyokhina is charged are: failing to get up on time on two occasions; attempting to smuggle personal correspondence out through her lawyer (all letters are supposed to pass the colony censor); and refusing to explain her behavior when reprimanded for inappropriate speech. Alyokhina counters that she did not hear the wake-up call (she is in protective solitary, so there are no other inmates around to wake her); she never tried to smuggle any letters; and that she wanted her lawyer present when she testified about her alleged inappropriate speech. Now she was hoping to present her case - her four cases - to an actual judge, with the help of her defense attorney and a human rights activist who had been allowed to join the case as a ""community defender,"" as Russian law allows. The only problem was, Alyokhina's lawyer and the human rights activist were in the courtroom and Alyokhina herself was behind bars - a mere 10 miles or so away, but unable to see or hear her defense team, much less confer with them. The judge's mocking ""you can hear us"" only underscored that point: All Alyokhina was likely to hear under those circumstances was a summary decision on which she will have had no influence. Alyokhina decided to stall. She kept asking for an opportunity to confer with her defense team. The judge would empty the courtroom to allow Alyokhina to talk to her team via the video link, but as soon as the court reconvened Alyokhina would file the same motion again. Alexander Podrabinek, the human rights activist, thought  the tactic witty and infinitely sustainable. A full day passed in fits and starts, with nothing heard on the substance of Alyokhina's case. On Day 2, the judge, apparently frustrated, directed Alyokhina's defense attorney to stay with her and address the court via video conference. Alyokhina had gained access to her attorney, but on the whole the stalling tactic had backfired: She now had access to only one of two members of her team, and rather than find herself in open court, where she wanted to be, she found her own lawyer behind bars. The third day of the trial, which is Monday, finds Alyokhina giving up her efforts to be allowed to appear personally in court. The few journalists who traveled to Berezniki to cover the trial have left town. Alyokhina's alleged violations will probably be upheld in a largely empty courtroom, with Alyokhina herself staring at a screen in a room in the penal colony, unable to see or hear much. Then again, this is pretty much what the Russian justice system has looked like to Alyokhina ever since she was arrested almost a year ago.",2013,"Russia"
"294","Feminist Group Seeks Protection in Ukraine","EECA","MOSCOW -- Leaders of Femen, the Ukrainian women's rights group known for staging bare-breasted political protests, demanded government protection on Sunday after two of them and a male associate were assaulted while on vacation in the Black Sea port city of Odessa. The two leaders, Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko, and Viktor Svatsky, a colleague, were beaten by unknown assailants on Saturday night outside an apartment building in Odessa where they were staying. It was the fifth time in recent weeks that members of Femen were assaulted. The group says the attacks are part of a campaign to drive it out of the country. In a statement, the group called on Ukraine's minister of internal affairs, Vitaly Zakharchenko, to provide round-the-clock security. ''Otherwise Femen activists are in mortal danger,'' the group wrote, ''the responsibility for which will inevitably fall on the security forces of Ukraine.'' There was no immediate response from the government. The group, which got its start in the university town of Khmelnytsky, now has headquarters in Kiev, the capital, and in Paris, along with branches in seven other countries. Members of the group, which says it opposes patriarchy in all forms, have staged topless demonstrations on an array of issues, including protests against prostitution, sex trafficking, organized religion, income inequality, domestic violence, female circumcision and authoritarian governments. Photographs posted on the group's Web site on Sunday showed Ms. Hutsol with a swollen, red nose, a bloody eye and cuts above her lip, and Mr. Svatsky with welts on the side of his head, blackened eyes and a swollen lower lip. Ms. Shevchenko, in a telephone interview from Odessa, said that she and her colleagues had been returning to the apartment building after grocery shopping and had planned to cook shrimp for dinner when three men ambushed them in the darkened courtyard. ''I saw that some guy is starting to run to us,'' she said. ''It was not just a hooligan. It was not a person who was just passing by.'' ''He ran to Viktor and started to beat him,'' she said. ''We started to scream, and Anna started to beat this guy with her backpack. I didn't have anything. I started to run, to escape. This guy started to beat Anna. I started to escape from the yard, and there were two men who started to run after me. They pushed me and I fell down, and they kicked me in the head and ran back and continued to beat Anna and Viktor.'' An Odessa regional police spokesman, Vladimir Shalivenko, told Agence France-Presse that the case was being investigated as an assault involving ''minor bodily harm.'' Ms. Shevchenko said that Mr. Svatsky and Ms. Hutsol had been treated at a hospital and were recovering, but that at the time of the attack on Saturday had not yet healed from previous assaults in Kiev. Last month, Mr. Svatsky was beaten savagely near Femen's office in Kiev and spent two weeks in a hospital. Then, Ms. Hutsol was attacked outside her apartment and her dog was stolen, and, on the same day, Ms. Shevchenko, two other Femen members and a photojournalist were beaten and detained overnight by the Ukrainian authorities. Those attacks coincided with a visit to Kiev by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Patriarch Kirill I, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, for festivities related to the anniversary of the church's founding. Ms. Shevchenko said the group had initially believed that the attacks were instigated by the Russian government to prevent a repeat of a situation early this year in Hanover, Germany, in which Ms. Shevchenko, topless, ran toward Mr. Putin, who was visiting a trade show with Chancellor Angela Merkel. Ms. Shevchenko, who had a profane slogan written on her chest accusing Mr. Putin of being a dictator, came within a few feet of the Russian leader before security officers wrestled her to the ground. Odessa, which is known as a hub for international sex trafficking, would seem to be a logical place for a Femen protest. But it is also one of Ukraine's most popular resort cities, and the group's leaders said the only thing they had planned was time at the beach. Ms. Shevchenko said that in recent days the group had let down its guard. ''We were a little bit relaxed,'' she said. ''We thought that everything was over, and it was just guys from Russia. We went to Odessa just to have a small vacation.'' While the Ukrainian government previously brought legal pressure against the group, including criminal charges related to hooliganism and public indecency, Ms. Shevchenko said the attack in Odessa had convinced leaders of the group that a broader effort is now under way to intimidate them and drive them out of Ukraine. She said they might leave. ''Really, we are thinking about'' leaving the country, Ms. Shevchenko said. ''We can't just stay here and wait for another attack and a moment when they kill somebody. Now, I think, it can really happen.'' She added, ''It's physical pressure, and they are not afraid to do it.'' Ms. Shevchenko said she had a constant sense of being followed, even while on vacation. ''We thought maybe we had paranoia,'' she said. ''Now we can say it's true; they follow us everywhere.''",2013,"Ukraine"
"295","Ukrainian Court Fines Feminist Protesters","EECA","A court in Kiev fined three activists of Femen, the Ukrainian feminist organization known for its bare-breasted protests, and a Russian photojournalist on Sunday and released them following their Saturday arrest. Femen said that the women had been beaten and kidnapped when they were arrested and that they had been targeted by Ukraine's security service, the SBU, to prevent protests during a visit to Kiev by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Patriarch Kirill I of the Russian Orthodox church, who have been accosted by Femen members in the past. Police said that the women, Oksana Shachko, Alexandra Shevchenko, and Yana Zhdanova, were detained by a patrol car after officers spotted them naked and arrested them for ''petty hooliganism'' after they failed to cover up. The photojournalist, Dmitry Kostyukov, was accused of disobeying police orders. Mr. Kostyukov told the Russian television channel Dozhd, on Sunday that all the women had been clothed and that he and they were attacked and beaten by 15 to 20 men in plain clothes as he was photographing the activists outside an apartment building. A police car drove up then to arrest them. ''My head, face and back hurt, and I have some dizziness,'' Mr. Kostyukov told Dozhd. ''Oksana was hit in the kidneys and the chest.'' Sunday's fines were small, the equivalent of about $10.50 for each woman and just over $16.70 for Mr. Kostyukov, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported. Femen's leader, Anna Hutsol, said she was attacked twice on Saturday, in which her dog was kidnapped and she was beaten in the face. ''This is not possible in a normal, democratic country,'' she in a telephone interview. ''More and more we are resembling Russia and Belarus.'' Femen also reported on Thursday that Viktor Svyatsky, a political scientists who is affiliated with the organization, was beaten on Wednesday and warned by his attackers that similar measures would be used against other activists. Graphic photographs of his swollen and cut face were posted on the site.",2013,"Ukraine"

Both activists, Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, immediately dismissed the amnesty, issued just three months before the end of their jail terms, as a ""cosmetic"" publicity stunt tied to the Winter Olympics that Russia is hosting in Sochi in February. Subtitled video of Ms. Tolokonnikova's remarks to the television crews waiting for her outside the Siberian prison hospital where she had been held for the past month was posted online by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the American-financed news network. Asked about her future plans, Ms. Tolokonnikova told Russia's TV Rain that she and Ms. Alyokhina had ""a plan for a human rights organization to help prisoners in Russia."" According to an English translation of her complete remarks prepared by The Interpreter, a website supported by the dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Institute of Modern Russia, she added: I don't consider this time lost for myself. I acquired a unique experience. Therefore, it will be much simpler to be involved in concrete human rights activity than before. I have become more mature and have come to know the state from inside; I saw this little totalitarian machine, what it is like from inside. Russia is really built on the model of the colony. Therefore it is so important to change the colony now, so as to change Russia along with the colony. The colony and the prison are the face of the country. ""We didn't ask for any pardon,"" Ms. Alyokhina told my colleague David Herszenhorn. ""I would have sat here until the end of my sentence because I don't need mercy from Putin."" Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former oil tycoon who was suddenly released on Friday into de facto exile in Germany after a decade in prison, said something similar in a news conference on Sunday in Berlin. Mr. Khodorkovsky, who described the circumstances of his release to the journalist Yevgenia Albats on Saturday, told Russian reporters at the news conference that their attention had been crucial in his case and also ""helps very many people who remain unjustly in our Russian prisons preserve their lives, health and hope for freedom."" He urged the journalists not to see his release ""as a symbol that there are no political prisoners left in Russia."" ""I would like you to take me as a symbol that the efforts of civil society may lead to the release of people whose release was not expected by anyone,"" he said. TV Rain also captured video of Mr. Khodorkovsky's emotional reunion with his parents as they arrived in Berlin from Moscow to be with him.",2013,"Russia"
"297","Pussy Riot Members Take Tour to New York","EECA","Two young women from the Russian punk group Pussy Riot said Wednesday that their 21-month incarceration in Russia's penal system for having staged a political protest in a Moscow cathedral had emboldened them to speak out more forcefully against President Vladimir V. Putin, partly because of the global support they received. In an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, the women said they had no fear of further imprisonment and suggested they may even run for political office in Russia someday. They also advocated a boycott or ''other subversive actions'' aimed at the Winter Olympic Games, which are about to commence in Sochi. And they expressed admiration for the political protest movement underway in Ukraine, saying they hope it creates an infectious spirit in Russia. ''What happened was that the support and care shown internationally around the world made us free even though, physically, we were behind bars,'' one of the members, Maria Alyokhina, 25, said in Russian through a translator in response to the question of whether prison had intimidated them. ''In light of that, it's kind of silly to talk about having to go through that a second time as something that would instill fear in us.'' Her colleague, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 24, said: ''This is certainly not the time for us to be afraid. In these two years since the act for which we were imprisoned, the situation in Russia has gotten so much worse. And if we couldn't keep quiet about it then, then we certainly won't keep quiet about it now.'' Both women were in New York, their first visit to the United States, as part of an international tour that has included stops in Asia and Europe since their release from prison on Dec. 23, near the end of a two-year term, for having conducted an anti-Putin performance in Moscow's main cathedral. They were released under an amnesty law that has been widely viewed as a means for Mr. Putin to reduce or eliminate criticism of Russia during the Olympics. The incarceration of the women on charges of hooliganism and inciting religious hatred elevated their stature into global symbols of human rights and freedom in Russia. Since their release they have vowed to promote feminism, gay rights, improved treatment of prisoners and more transparency in the Russian political system. They arrived in New York on Tuesday and were among the celebrities at an Amnesty International benefit concert on Wednesday evening at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, sharing the stage with Madonna, Lauryn Hill, Imagine Dragons, the Flaming Lips, Peter Gabriel, Bob Geldof, Yoko Ono, Susan Sarandon, Sting and others. The purpose of the concert was to raise awareness of what Amnesty calls prisoners of conscience -- peaceful people incarcerated or persecuted for their political beliefs, race, gender or sexual identity. In an hourlong interview at The Times, the women sharply criticized the entire Russian system under Mr. Putin for what they called its systematic suppression of differing views, independent thought and gay rights. ''We always insisted from the very beginning that Pussy Riot is first and foremost a political group which is using art as a way to express its political opinion because it's impossible to do so through any legal means,'' Ms. Tolokonnikova said. ''No dialogue is possible with the Russian authorities and they have proven that again and again.'' They attributed the lost momentum of political protest in Russia partly to intimidation under Mr. Putin, particularly after his inauguration for a third term as president in 2012, and the absence of any meaningful coverage of dissident views by the Russian news media. ''When the whole country sees completely innocent people being jailed, and authorities make it very clear that this can happen to absolutely anyone, that of course is going to make a lot of people become more silent,'' Ms. Tolokonnikova said. ''But not everybody agrees to be silent, and right now our task is to unite those people once again.'' They expressed particular concern about the global news media's inattention to a Moscow trial of participants in a May 6, 2012, anti-Putin demonstration, the day before his inauguration, that suddenly turned violent. Some of the defendants in what has become known as the May 6 trial, who represent a cross-section of middle-class Muscovites, have been languishing in jail since then, with little or no evidence against them. Verdicts could be announced Feb. 21, a few days before the Olympics conclude. ''This is just Putin's way of getting revenge,'' Ms. Alyokhina said. Asked why they were released, Ms. Tolokonnikova said: ''Because there was a lot of pressure from the West to release us, and the lesson that we learned from this is that Putin is concerned with the opinion of the West and Western press.'' They suggested that an Olympic boycott or other form of protest at the Sochi games, which the Russian authorities have gone to extensive lengths to avoid or suppress, would be an effective way of conveying such a message. ''By going to the Olympics you're essentially stepping back from your beliefs and showing support for Putin's regime of oppression,'' Ms. Alyokhina said. Ms. Tolokonnikova said political protesters could organize a boycott ''or something more active, where they do come and then stage protests or other subversive actions.'' Asked if they would like to run for office in Russia, both women acknowledged they had been asked that question before and had not ruled it out. ''It would be a very interesting opportunity for us and maybe we should try and do that,'' Ms. Tolokonnikova said. Their stay in New York also included a visit on Wednesday with Samantha Power, the American ambassador to the United Nations. Kurtis A. Cooper, the deputy spokesman at the United States Mission, said in an email that ''Ambassador Power thanked them for their advocacy, particularly on behalf of those in prison whose voices cannot be heard, and their extraordinary bravery and pledged the United States's commitment to continue to advocate strongly on behalf of human rights and freedom of assembly and speech.'' Ms. Power's meeting with them also elicited some sarcasm from Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador. ''Oh, she has not joined the band, has she?'' he told reporters during a briefing at the Russian Mission. ''I would expect her to invite them to perform at the National Cathedral in Washington.'' Both women also appeared on Comedy Central's ''The Colbert Report'' on Tuesday evening and incited raucous cheers from the audience with comeback lines at the host, Stephen Colbert. Asked by Mr. Colbert what crime they had committed, Ms. Alyokhina said: ''We sang a fun song in a church.'' When Mr. Colbert defended Mr. Putin's desire to lead Russia into a bright future, Ms. Tolokonnikova responded: ''We have different ideas about a bright future and we don't want a shirtless man on a horse leading us into that bright future.''",2014,"Russia"

"299","PLAYBOY'S FALL IN BRAZIL AIDS FEMINIST AIM","LA","A Brazilian jury last week returned a homicide conviction against a man whose earlier exoneration for having acted in defense of his male dignity had stirred a national women's campaign. Doca Street, a 47-year-old Sao Paulo playboy, was sentenced to 15 years in jail for the 1976 shooting of Angela Diniz, a 32-year-old socialite, in the voguish beach resort of Buzios 120 miles east of here. Two years ago in the same courtroom he was given a two-and-a-halfyear suspended sentence that acknowledged his having killed Miss Diniz with four shots fired at point-blank range but accepted his argument that he did so ''in legitimate defense of honor.'' A lawyer for the Diniz family, Heleno Fragoso, said at the time, ''With this verdict, Latin American machismo was judged and absolved.'' A series of similar ''crimes of passion'' since then had focused national attention on the new trial, ordered by a higher court.  While Brazilian women have yet to organize politically with any effectiveness, the one issue that has served to unite them has been marital violence. Slogans appeared on walls around Rio in recent weeks saying that, ''without punishment, more women will perish'' and ''if Doca is not condemned, others will die of love too.'' Verdict 'a Great Conquest' ''This verdict is a great conquest for us,'' Rose Marie Muraro, one of their leaders, said after the judgment. Several thousand women had gathered outside the courthouse during the trial with banners and placards protesting the lenient treatment handed out by Brazilian courts to men who kill wives or female companions they suspect of infidelity. Cries of ''Assassin!'' and ''Gigolo!'' greeted Mr. Street as he passed through the same courthouse square that was filled with his supporters two years ago. ''At that time, he had public opinion in his favor, but today no one is for him because there have been so many violent acts against women,'' Miss Muraro said. One of the documents introduced into the trial record was a feminist study maintaining that since the verdict favoring Mr. Street there had been 722 cases in Sao Paulo alone in which men had killed female companions and claimed ''legitimate defense of honor'' as a justification. ''If Brazilian women decided to kill all the husbands who were unfaithful,'' said Moema Toscano, a prominent Rio de Janiero sociologist, ''it would probably mean the end of the species.'' She said the trial's outcome revealed what a ''farce'' the first one was but warned that it did not mean the end of the ''mentality.'' Father Defends Killer Mr. Street's father had visited each of the 21 people from whom the six-man, one-woman jury was eventually chosen and had given them a lawyer's report noting that his son had not committed any criminal acts since the murder, that he had a job and was no threat to society if left free. Miss Diniz's 18-year-old son, Milton, had directed an appeal to the same people arguing that Mr. Street was instead ''a cold and calculating man who now slanders my mother to free himself of any guilt.'' Milton occupied a front-row seat in the courthouse and, as he had promised, spent the whole time staring at the defendant. He had complained in interviews that Mr. Street had succeeded in killing his mother twice, first when he shot her and later when he justified it by depicting her as ''the scarlet whore of Babylon'' in the first trial. ''Of one thing I am certain,'' the young man said. ''The Angela who was my mother, full of life, concerned with her children, loving and caring, cannot be the woman who Doca Street put in the newspapers.'' A number of jurists had criticized the first trial as having made Miss Diniz rather than Mr. Street the defendant. She was a wellknown beauty and a millionaire who had figured in incidents in which a servant was shot dead in her bedroom by a lover and marijuana was found in her Copacabana apartment. Defendant Seldom Worked Tall, urbane, wavy-haired and handsome, Mr. Street left his wife and children to live with Miss Diniz.  The prosecution contended that he killed Miss Diniz in the bathroom of the beach house they shared because she had said she wanted to end their romance. Mr. Street told the court it was because she had flirted with a German woman on the beach and later told him she wanted the freedom to have relations with women and other men. Tax records produced by the prosecution showed he had seldom worked and had instead lived off the rich women he accompanied.  ''Only after the first trial did he try to make it look like he did anything for a living,'' said Mr. Fragoso in his court argument.  ''Until then, all he had done was exploit women.''",1981,"Brazil"
"300","Machismo on Trial; The Feminist Backlash to Brazil's 'Crimes of Passion'","LA","She was ""the panther of Buzios,"" a sleek Brazilian beauty who liked to boast. ""I'm rich, beautiful and good in a fight. He was a Rio playboy, without money or a job, who used his languorous good looks to marry -- and later left -- three Brazilian heiresses. Together, Angela Diniz, 32, and Raul ""Doca"" Street, 45, shared her villa in Buzios, one of the most sought-after anchorages of the 500-mile Brazilian Riviera. Their bedroom window overlooked the sparkling white sands and deep azure waters of the Atlantic. But after two months, Angela Diniz grew tired of financing Street's expensive tastes: Italian suits, French cognacs, and American cigarettes.And at the end of one long, hot day of vodka, backgammon and quarrels on the beach, the independent-minded Diniz told him to move out and make room for a replacement. Barefoot and dressed only in a halter top and a flowered bikini bottom, Diniz never got a chance to prove she was good in a fight. The 6-foot-1 Street fired a semi-automatic Beretta 7.65, and within seconds, her blood splashed over an ornamental urn and a whitewashed love seat, slowly collecting in a dark pool on the glazed patio tiles. At the October 1979 trial, Street's counsel was a former supreme court justice who painted Diniz as ""a luxurious Babylonian prostitute,"" ""a lascivious woman"" and ""a scarlet woman of the kind we have been warned about in the apocalypse."" Street, he argued repeatedly, suffered ""a violent moral aggression"" and killed Diniz out of ""legitimate defense of his honor."" During a break in the trial, a cluster of women loudly applauded the tall and tanned defendant. One woman waved a sign reading, ""Doca, we're with you."" Forensic testimony at the trial showed Street shot Angela Diniz once in the face, paused to unjam his pistol, then fired twice into her upraised arm, and three more times into her head. The jury of two women and five men found Street guilty only of involuntary homicide -- a verdict given on the basis of the argument that he acted to defend his ""masculine honor."" The judge let him walk out the door with a two-year suspended sentence. Brazilian media blanketed the trial. Television channels broke into regular programming to bring flashes live from the courtroom. The crime, the verdict, the sentence -- and its message -- were broadcast across Brazil. What ensued was, in the words of one feminist, ""a hunting season on women in Brazil."" One newspaper's crime survey showed that in 1980, in Sa o Paulo alone, 772 women were murdered by their husbands or lovers. Few authors of these ""crimes of passion"" were severely punished. Last month, Brazil's national symbol of machismo returned to court for a retrial. Doca Street could no longer walk leisurely up the courthouse steps, bestowing leering grins on his female cheerleaders. Instead, 20 military police had to force a corridor through a mob of 500 angry feminists who greeted the aristocratic playboy with loud shouts of ""Jail the gigolo,"" and with banners bearing the women's movement slogan: ""Quem Ama, Nao Mata"" -- ""Lovers Don't Kill."" ""D-Day for Doca,"" drum-rolled the local tabloids. This time he got 15 years and was taken away in a paddy wagon, and was put in a cell with six alleged muggers. His lawyer immediately appealed the verdict, and he was released after three hours. It was the same crime, the same courtroom, the same testimony and the same penal code. What had changed was Brazil. The Changing Climate Long pinpricked by a vocal minority of feminists, Brazilian machismo is now being threatened by slow, massive shifts among mainstream Brazilian women. ""We make much more noise than our small numbers would suggest,"" says Rio feminist Rose Marie Murario, still flushed with victory after assembling 19 women's groups from Rio, Sa o Paulo and Belo Horizonte to picket Doca's retrial. Murario, head of the Brazilian Women's Center, estimates that there are 10,000 militant feminists among Brazil's 60 million women. However, she adds, the feminists have a strong impact on Brazilian public opinion through the media.  The most vivid example of the changes taking place is ""TV Woman."" In less than two years, this 3 1/2-hour morning show has won 8 million daily viewers. In addition to fashion tips and recipes for fruit-based hair shampoos, a house lawyer regularly discusses women's legal rights and a sexologist offers a frank daily sex class. Sipping coffee and sitting cross-legged on a big cushion, Marilia Gabriela, 33, the show's hostess, interviews guests on such topics as day-care centers, crimes of passion, postponed marriages, the right to remain single, Brazil's new divorce law and abortion, which is widely practiced but remains illegal. Gabriela receives 500 letters a day from viewers. Surveys show that Brazilian women are increasingly well educated and are steadily moving into the work force. In the last decade, the number of university women quintupled, and the proportion of working women rose from 19 percent to 33 percent. In Congress, Brazil's only female senator, Eunice Michiles from the state of Amazonas, is sponsoring a bill to revoke a law that permits automatic annulment of a marriage if the husband discovers within the first 10 days of marriage a ""basic error"" -- that his wife is not a virgin. Most ""Brasileiras"" remain confined to traditional, low-paying jobs -- housemaids, rural workers, washerwomen, seamstresses, nurses, clerks, primary school teachers. But in the Amazonian frontier states, women are moving into nontraditional trades, such as carpenters' helpers on construction sites. Overall, women earn an average of $40 a week -- half the average earnings for men. ""There are more freedoms,"" acknowledges feminist sociologist Helieth Saffioti. ""But women are still economically dependent on men -- and that way I can't see how they can become liberated."" A study of 1,080 married women in Rio and Sa o Paulo found that 89 percent did not have their own bank accounts, 70 percent were not allowed to go out in the evening without their husbands, and 59 percent had husbands who did not want their wives to wear eye-catching clothes. The Macho Club Hoping to halt any further erosion of these traditional male values, Rio's social columnist Ibrahim Sued announced last year the creation of a ""Macho Club."" As self-appointed president, Sued set the tenets: ""Women like to submit to men""; and ""Women should only go out accompanied by their husband, but he should be able to go out without her, whenever he wants, without explanations."" Setting a role model, Sued is frequently photographed with his sport shirt open to the navel, exposing a mass of silver hair and a heavy gold medallion resting on his paunch. At the recent marriage of his daughter, Sued gave the following marital advice: ""Be submissive."" And, ""When you have a cold or cough, sleep on a cot so as not to disturb your husband."" After a few weeks, the club -- whose motto is ""The Macho Is Always Ready When His Woman Wants Him"" -- withered from the headlines. In September, Nova Magazone, a Brazilian counterpart of Cosmopolitan, published a survey of 3,600 women. In it, 65 percent said they wanted more sex. To fulfil this need, 30 percent of the married respondents said they betray their husbands. It is against this backdrop of conflicts and social change that Brazilian women have become increasingly irate over the upsurge of men killing women to defend the masculine concept of honor. ""Defense of the honor is like a consumer complaint -- if you buy a defective television, you get rid of it. Women aren't bought, they are not the property of anyone,"" says Ana Terezina Manssur Mercadane, 23, a statistician at the Banco do Brasil. ""Angela Diniz was one of the most talked about women in Brazil,"" says Rose Marie Murario, the Rio feminist. ""Through television, her killing and Doca's suspended sentence reached everyone -- I am convinced the murders increased because of the precedent."" After Doca's suspended sentence in October 1979, some of the most publicized killings took place in Minas Gerais, a hilly interior state notorious for its conservatism. In one case, Geraldo Lima de Barros, a 50-year-old truck driver in Juiz de Fora, had already once discovered that his wife, Helena Aparecida, was cheating on him. ""The first time,"" he told a reporter, ""she got down and on her knees and cried so much it wet my shoe."" He forgave her, but out of shame, sold his house and moved his family. The second time, Geraldo returned home unexpectedly to find Helena gone, and cosmetics spread across her dresser. He found her dancing in a local nightclub with an unknown man. This time, he shot her four times with his .32-caliber pistol. At the trial, Helena's three brothers and two brothers-in-law stepped forward to testify to Geraldo's good character. ""I would rather see my sister dead than each day in the hands of a different man,"" said one brother. Geraldo pleaded legitimate defense of his honor, and an all-male jury quickly absolved him of the crime. One week earlier, in the same courtroom, another all-male jury absolved Jose Marco Pinheiro, a construction worker, who knifed his wife to death after he discovered she was betraying him. ""My style is to work with men,"" said the judge, Joao Sidney Afonso, when asked by a reporter for O Globo, one of Rio's largest newspapers, why he didn't allow women on his juries. ""In crimes of passion, where a man kills his wife, women jurors will invariably convict."" The judge argued that his courthouse did not have adequate sanitary facilities for ""the fragile sex."" Women, he said, rarely serve as jurors in the 300 district courts of Minas Gerais, Brazil's third most populous state. In response, even the judge's wife told reporters: ""I think it's absurd what Sidney's doing. I'm against it, and I always tell him: Women should be jurors."" The local lawyers' association blasted the judge's stand as ""stupid, reactionary and illegal."" The local Center of Women's Rights painted city walls with: ""In Minas, a marriage certificate is a death warrant."" Doca's Retrial Alarmed by the courtroom lenience shown in these and many other murders, Brazilian feminists started to demand a retrial of Doca to show that ""legitimate defense of honor"" was no longer valid in modern-day Brazil. Acting on an appeal from Diniz's family, a higher court annulled the jury's involuntary homicide verdict on the grounds that the decision was ""manifestly contrary to the proof contained in the legal records."" In the popular press, daily headlines built up the tension: ""Angela's son hates her killer,"" ""Angela's killer doesn't want to go to jail."" Newspapers refreshed their readers with the steamy details of the case: How Doca's only known job before the killing had been a stint as a swimming instructor at a Miami hotel; * How he met Diniz at a party at the house of his third wife, Adelita; * How, on leaving Adelita, he threw his clothes into several suitcases. But they were her bags. So he wrapped his clothes up in a sheet. But it was her sheet. Finally, carrying all his clothes in his arms, he walked out of her Sa o Paulo home. The morning of the trial dawned sunny, and swarms of food vendors arrived early, eager to cash in.  During the 18-hour trial, as many as 2,000 onlookers, many of them feminists, packed the courthouse square. The judge's opening words were drowned out by a television reporter conducting a live interview with Milton Villas Boas Diniz, 18, the oldest of Diniz's three children. ""Contrary to what that guy Doca goes spreading around, she was a very good woman for all the family,"" said young Diniz. ""I wish I could kill him with my stare,"" he said and proceeded to stare at Doca for most of the next 18 hours. For his part, Doca adopted a contrite, downcast pose and stared at the floor for most of those 18 hours, ignoring hoarsely whispered entreaties from the cameramen to ""look over here."" At one point, the black-robed judge stopped the proceedings to place Doca where he wouldn't overheat from the television lights, but where he would also afford the cameramen a better angle. The trial continued straight through the night because the judge said the court could not afford lodgings for the jurors. Clerks read depositions from the first trial. The testimony recounted how Diniz had ordered Doca to leave. He jumped in his coffee-colored Maverick and roared off in a spray of sand, then wheeled around, returned and asked her to reconsider. She threw a leather shoulder bag at him. He shot her, placed the gun by the body, and then drove to Sa o Paulo, 387 miles to the south. Despite a reported $21,000 fee, Doca's new defense lawyer, Humberto Teles, did not match the oratory of his predecessor. Teles argued that Doca Street could not be a symbol of machismo because his grandfather, an English industrialist in Sa o Paulo, was reportedly the first factory owner in Brazil to pay equal wages to men and women. Teles described Diniz as ""a woman who traded her three children for Rio's nightlife,"" and called Doca, now 47, merely ""a big boy with a gypsy soul."" Doca, he said, is now a model citizen who lives with his mother in Sa o Paulo and has sworn off night life. Now gainfully employed as a Volkswagen salesman, Doca even won an efficiency award from his dealership. There was little suspense as to the outcome. Based on interviews with the judge and jurors, a newspaper printed the 5-to-2 guilty verdict and the 15-year sentence -- the day the trial started. Citing this newspaper article, the defense argued that the jury was biased, and appealed the decision. Still, the defense lawyer had harsh words for the feminist demonstrators, who, he charged, had ""manipulated public opinion"" against his client. ""They are Hitler's daughters,"" he said, ""fascist women . . . with a clear homosexual component."" ""Juries understand that a man can kill a woman when his masculine dignity is offended -- in this case, she hit him in the face with a bag,"" the lawyer said after the trial. But others believe that Doca's defeat will sound the swan song of the ""legitimate defense of the honor"" in Brazil. In the two weeks after that verdict, juries in the conservative state of Minas Gerais deliberated three separate cases in which husbands killed their wives out of what was called ""legitimate defense of honor."" In each case, the defendant was found guilty. ""The importance of the Doca Street decision,"" says Heleno Claudio Fragaso, special prosecutor in the case, ""is that husbands now know they can't kill their wives.""",1981,"Brazil"
"301","Trial Delayed for El Salvador Soldiers in Killing 4 U.S.","LA","The long-awaited trial of five national guardsmen in El Salvador charged with murdering four American women missionaries two years ago will be postponed for about two months, according to the Associated Press, while judges consider a request for dismissal of the proceedings. The defense lawyer has argued that Salvadoran Judge Bernardo Rauda Murcia had set the trial date for the five soldiers before their defense lawyers were appointed. The postponement will delay start of the trial well beyond the Jan. 23 date on which the Reagan administration must certify to Congress that El Salvador is improving its human rights record if it is to continue to receive aid from this country. Congress has made that assurance a requirement before it approves $61.3 million in military aid and $164.9 million in economic aid from the United States to El Salvador next year. An estimated 30,000 people have been murdered over the past three years in fighting between guerrillas and government forces there. Earlier this month, relatives of the slain Roman Catholic missionaries denounced the trial as an attempted ""cover-up,"" maintaining that the killing of the four women had been ordered at a higher level in the government.",1982,"El Salvador"
"302","MACHISMO MURDER CASE: WOMEN BITTER IN BRAZIL","LA","The exoneration last week of a systems analyst who killed his wife because she wanted to separate from him to see another man has drawn national attention to a Brazilian legal precept that accepts such a reaction as a ''legitimate defense of honor.'' The 1980 murder had served to unite the previously fragmented women's movement in Brazil and had spurred the creation of organizations in various cities to help wives suffering violence in their homes. ''This case was the symbol for us,'' said Paula Montero, a sociologist who is a member of the Center for the Defense of Women's Rights here. The 35-year-old defendant, Marcio Stanciolli, fired five shots into the body of his wife, Eloisa, a 32-year-old operator of a chain of fashionable clothing stores, as she lay sleeping in a mansion the well-to-do couple and their two children shared in this provincial capital city. He told the court he had done so after she had confirmed his suspicions that she was interested in someone else and wanted to end their marriage. Men Applaud the Verdict Ariosvaldo de Campos Pires, the defense attorney, based his argument on the effect Mr. Stanciolli's jealousy had on his passions and on the fact that Mrs. Stanciolli customarily spent the day out of the house at her work to the neglect of her family duties. ''When a woman marries,'' he told the all-male, seven-member jury, ''she does so for the home and for the children.'' The jurors ruled here on May 14 that Mr. Stanciolli was justified in taking action but that he had used means that were not ''moderate'' under the terms of the Brazilian penal code. Based on this finding, Judge Celso Alves de Melo gave Mr. Stanciolli a suspended sentence of two years. The decision was applauded by males and jeered by women in the packed courtroom. ''Judicially, it became the same as if he had run over somebody accidentally with his car,'' Mr. Pires said in an interview explaining the outcome. In a separate interview, Antonio Orfeu Brauna, the homicide chief of the Belo Horizonte Police Department, who conducted the murder investigation, called Mr. Pires's defense ''brilliant'' but added, ''The only reason he won his client's freedom is he played perfectly to the machismo in this society.'' Dual Standard Noted Celina Albano, head of the women's group, complained that ''the fact that she had a busy professional life was held up as evidence that she had abandoned her kids while the fact that he was hardworking was presented as evidence that he was a good husband.'' The debate over machismo in Brazilian society has gained attention in recent years because of a number of cases similar to the murder of Mrs. Stanciolli. Next month, a court here will be trying Eduardo Souza Rocha, a 36-year-old landscape architect who killed his 30-year-old wife, Regina, on Aug. 11, 1980, less than two weeks after Mrs. Stanciolli died. Mr. Rocha told the police that he shot her six times after she told him she was leaving him for another man. He also listed as contributing factors the fact that his wife smoked, drove about the city without a chaperon, often was not at home to welcome him when he returned from work and watched popular television serials that showed people ''kissing passionately.'' ''She wanted all those freedoms,'' he said.  Although he confessed he had first been attracted to her when he saw her in a miniskirt, he later forbade her to wear them. He also ordered her not to paint her nails, pluck her eyebrows, wear highheeled shoes or consult a male gynecologist. Verdict Is Overturned A jury in Mr. Rocha's first trial did not accept his claim of legitimate defense of honor, but the verdict was overturned on appeal. There is speculation he may now seek to engage Mr. Pires, who, in addition to his success in the Stanciolli case, obtained the exoneration of Roberto Lobato, a wealthy Belo Horizonte contractor who killed his wife, Jo, daughter of a man who was then mayor of the city, when she sought to leave him. This city is the capital of a state, Minas Gerais, that enjoys a reputation among Brazilians for its conservatism. In the aftermath of the two 1980 killings here, women's groups around the country staged protests and daubed public spaces with the slogans, ''In Minas a marriage certificate is a death warrant'' and ''Who loves doesn't kill.'' Women's defense centers were set up here and in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Recife, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Goiania and Joao Pessoa. Several months later, the groups had reason to believe their pressure was bringing results. A jury in the resort community of Cabo Frio in the State of Rio de Janeiro returned a homicide conviction against Doca Street, a Sao Paulo playboy who in a widely publicized 1979 trial had been absolved in the shooting death of his socialite friend, Angela Diniz. Women Besiege Court Several thousand women had gathered outside the court during the new trial, and slogans had appeared on walls around Rio saying, ''Without punishment, more women will perish'' and, ''If Doca is not condemned, others will die of love too.'' One of the documents introduced into the trial record was a feminist study maintaining that since the verdict favoring Mr. Street there had been 722 cases in Sao Paulo alone in which men had killed female companions and later claimed ''legitimate defense of honor'' as a justification. ''We worry now that the fact that Marcio got off will embolden men to step up the violence against their wives,'' said Maria de Lourdes Baeza, another sociologist with the Belo Horizonte women's center. Mr. Brauna said that in his five years of homicide work here men who killed their wives had almost always pleaded legitimate defense of honor and generally received ''light'' sentences, if any. Asked about women killing men, he said, ''It's very rare.'' Such a case occurred recently in Brasilia, however. In the trial, which ended Tuesday, the 29-year-old defendant, Rubia Maria de Oliveira Sousa, was convicted of killing her male friend and sentenced to 14 years in jail.",1983,"Brazil"
"303","BRAZIL'S BATTERED WOMEN FIND HAVEN FROM ABUSE","LA","Twisting a handkerchief nervously in her hand, one woman recounted how a younger sister had been shot four times in the back by her husband. When asked to arrest the man, she said, a police official remarked indifferently that the victim must have committed adultery. Another woman in her mid-20's said between sobs that she was being terrorized by a former lover, a man with an extensive criminal record who had threatened to kill her if she did not live with him again. She said she went to the police, who advised her mockingly to ''get a sharp knife and stick it in his gut.'' Neither woman, though, seemed surprised by the reaction of the police. The inclination of police and judicial authorities here to view violent acts against women as justifiable ''crimes of passion'' has been such that, until now at least, many women never bothered to report rapes or beatings. Nonetheless, in a large waiting room about 80 other women lined up to tell their stories. ''What do you think we can do to help you?'' Rosmary Correa, a 36-year-old lawyer and police investigator, asked each after listening patiently to her problems. ''We can't carry out miracles. Remember, ours is only a police function.'' Busiest Precinct in City Yet, barely one month after it opened, the Special Precinct for the Defense of Women, which is also run entirely by women, has clearly demonstrated that it is needed. Visited daily by between 200 and 300 women, it has become the busiest police station in this huge, sprawling city. Some 500 police cases have been opened and 10 have already been sent for prosecution. Still more significant, although statistics on violence against women are notoriously difficult to compile, the Special Precinct has served to draw press and political attention to the problem. Sao Paulo is planning to open two more special precincts in poor neighborhoods, and Rio de Janeiro has already adopted the model. Other state governments are expected to follow suit. ''The response reflects the fact that the office should have been created a long time ago,'' Miss Correa said. ''All this violence was taking place without being known or attended. The fact women can tell their stories to another woman makes it easier for them to come forward. They feel less embarrassed. They feel they're getting a sympathetic hearing.'' Miss Correa, who is one of 26 women among Sao Paulo's 2,500 police inspectors, said that when the precinct opened Aug. 6 she had expected to hear many cases of rape. But so far only 20 percent of the reports have involved sexual crimes. Violence and the threat of violence against women have accounted for the great majority of complaints. ''Almost all this violence comes from husbands and lovers,'' the police inspector said. 'I'm Going to Cut Your Throat' As she sits at her desk for 12 hours or more each day, one human drama after another is paraded before her. A young woman said she fled her home after striking her husband with a hammer when he tried to beat her; now she wanted to recover her four children. Another woman in her 50's said that her husband had beaten her up regularly during 36 years of marriage, but that now she feared for her life. ''I'm serving him dinner and he keeps saying, 'I'm going to cut your throat one night,' '' she said. Yet another woman - their names are omitted for reasons of privacy and, in some cases, even security - said her husband had tried to kill her, her sister and brother-in-law one night. In court, her husband's lawyer justified his client's action by arguing that she had a sexual relationship with her brother-in-law and the judge ordered the man's release. She denied the charge, but says now that she is again terrified. In many cases, either Miss Correa or her assistant, Maria Clementina de Souza, 29, opens a formal police inquiry that may lead to prosecution. If the plaintiff shows physical signs of violence, perhaps a bruised face or a broken arm, a medical examiner adds his report. On occasions, the precinct's own police - all young women in civilian clothes who carry pistols and handcuffs - go out to make an arrest. Frequently, a lawyer doing volunteer work proffers her advice on getting a divorce. A good many of the cases, however, do not require police action. ''All I want is for my husband to stop hitting me,'' one woman said. ''I don't want to leave him.'' Miss Correa said she would call the man to the precinct for a conversation. ''He won't come,'' was the reply. ''Don't worry,'' Miss Correa assured her, ''he'll come or we'll go and get him. He's a big macho at home but he won't be here.'' Advising a Distraught Father Beyond being a police lawyer, in fact, the precinct chief has found herself acting as a sociologist, psychiatrist and marriage counselor. One elderly man arrived almost in tears to complain that his daughter was routinely beaten by her husband, but that she refused to leave home or even protest. ''If she won't bring an action, I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about it,'' Miss Correa said. ''Try and forget her. She doesn't deserve you.'' Noting that many problems were social rather than criminal, Miss Correa said that a group of social workers had been attached to the precinct. ''If a man is an alcoholic and wastes all the family's money, what can we do?'' she asked. ''Perhaps if he walks out on the family, we can trace him and at least make sure he pays some upkeep money.'' Most women who have sought out the Special Precinct to date have been middle-class or poor, but Miss Correa said she believes the problem of domestic violence exists at all social levels. ''We've had complaints against doctors, lawyers and industrialists,'' she said. ''But what happens among the wealthy is that a wife gets a black eye one week and is given a car a week later.'' Broader Discrimination Questions Because of the flood of complaints about domestic violence, the bureau has done little to seek out broader problems of discrimination against women, but some women with such problems have arrived anyway. One woman reported that she had been ordered to resign her office job when she became pregnant. The precinct called her employer and obtained the proper compensation, 20 times higher than what he had planned to pay. A complaint was also brought against a plastic surgeon who had operated on the breasts of two women; one died and the other lost both breasts. There is also a political motive for creating the Special Precinct. Mayoral elections, the first since civilian rule returned to Brazil this year, are being held here and in other state capitals in November and women's votes are being eagerly courted. Further, the return of democracy has permitted open debate of many social problems, including the plight of women, for the first time in two decades. At the prompting of feminist groups, the federal Government recently formed a special Women's Council to represent the interests of women before the Government. Feminist groups also proposed the Special Precinct here. Miss Correa, perhaps the most effective women's activist here today, said she had never met a feminist until the day the bureau was inaugurated.",1985,"Brazil"
"304","Brazil Tries to Curb Crimes Against Women","LA","Her right hand in a plaster cast, Josefa Gomes de Souza nervously recounted to a police chief how her husband, Adao Gomes Silva, threw her in a rage against a wall of their wooden shanty here. In another room, Mr. Silva, a steelworker, stared sullenly at the floor and tersely gave a differing version: ""She doesn't have a scar on her body. She caught her thumb in the door."" Traditionally, wife battery rarely reached Brazilian police stations, and more rarely, Brazilian courts. But on a recent afternoon, Mr. Silva sat on a bench at a Women's Police Station here, glumly facing the prospect of having to defend himself against criminal charges of assault. Crimes Against Women The women's police stations, already 57 in Sao Paulo state, are part of a growing effort to end judicial impunity afforded men who attack women in Latin America's most populous nation. Started in 1985, the stations are staffed by women officers and specialize in violent crimes against women. ""It is still possible in Brazil for a man to kill his allegedly unfaithful wife and be absolved on the grounds of honor,"" Americas Watch, a New York-based human rights group, said in a recent report. ""Rape is seldom investigated and rarely prosecuted."" While welcoming the innovation of police stations dedicated to women, Americas Watch warned of ""the continuing failure of Brazil's criminal justice system to treat violence aganst women as a crime."" In Rio de Janeiro, of more than 2,000 battery and sexual assault cases registered at one police station, none resulted in the punishment of the accused, the station chief told Americas Watch. In more than 4,000 similar cases reported in the northeastern city of Sao Luis, only two resulted in punishment of the accused. Here in Sao Paulo's gray industrial suburb of Santo Amaro, Iraci Medeiros Teixeira, chief of the local women's police station, patted a stack of green legal folders on her desk and said: ""When we have an assault case, it goes to court."" But, adding that ""there is no room to put all the offending men in jail,"" Ms. Teixeira said that much of her job was to act as a conjugal mediator for a recently urbanized population that lacked referees. Defenders and critics recognize that the women's police stations have remained a phenomenon larely restricted to Brazil's highly developed south. But in Brazil's northeast, an overpopulated cauldron of poverty, traditional machismo overwhelms the few women's police stations. One prosecutor in the northeastern state of Pernambuco estimated that, in 80 percent of cases, a local jury will acquit a man who alleges that he killed his wife to protect his honor. Last March, Brazilian feminists thought the honor defense had been laid to rest by a Supreme Court decision that murder could not be seen as a legitimate response to adultery. With this decision, the court ordered a new trial for Joao Lopes, a southern Brazilian man who knifed to death his wife and her lover. But on Aug. 29, a state court again acquitted Mr. Lopes of the double homicide.",1991,"Brazil"
"305","Central Americans Refugees, Caught in the Policy Chasm","LA","At 6:30 a.m. in Casa Companera, four Central American women -- three Salvadoran, one Guatemalan -- are in the kitchen preparing breakfast. It will be ready by 7, available for the 17 people living in the four-bedroom single-story house in a working-class neighborhood. Children come in and out of the kitchen, cared for by mutual watchfulness. Some will leave for school in about an hour. For their parents -- some work at home, others go out to jobs -- the day will be less worrisome than it would have been a few months back. Today they have no fear of being hounded by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or its armed branch, the Border Patrol. In late December, a federal district court in San Francisco ruled in favor of Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees by allowing the State and Justice Departments to settle a lawsuit charging them with discrimination against the Central Americans. In the Casa Companera kitchen, over the eggs, frijoles and toast, the Spanish-speaking women are familiar with the case only in broad outline. They understand it was a victory but they know, too, that they are still poor and a long way from their homeland and culture. They are caught in the apprehensiveness of knowing that they are likely to keep shouldering a load of misery created by public officials who will never be held accountable. All that the women have on their side, except for a spouse perhaps and maybe some kids or a relative or two back home, are some citizens of conscience who took the case to the courts and who make such way stations as Casa Companera as homelike as possible. They were the soul of the sanctuary movement in the 1980s, an heroic group spied on by the FBI and harassed by the INS. Vindication has come. They were on the winning side, the refugees' side. The court settlement, occurring after five years of class-action litigation, means that some 500,000 previously illegal aliens now have a fairer chance of resisting what was once almost automatic deportation. In the 1980s, 97 percent of Salvadoran and 99 percent of Guatemalan refugees were denied political asylum in the United States, while in the same decade three-fourths of those fleeing the Soviet Union and two-thirds from China had their applications for asylum approved. Attorneys for the refugees -- including the National Lawyers Guild, the ACLU and the Center for Constitutional Rights -- argued successfully that federal officials routinely skirted the Refugees Act of 1980 by discriminating against Salvadorans and Guatemalans because of ideological bents by Reagan administration officials. The settlement is a major legal defeat for the reactionary policies of Elliott Abrams, the former State Department ideologue who oversaw Central American policy. Unyieldingly, Abrams advocated full military support for Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments while ignoring the often murderous effects of that aid on people who fled north for their lives. An estimated 75,000 Salvadorans and 100,000 Guatemalen civilians were killed in the 1980s, with another 1.5 million made homeless. Abrams's strident refrain throughout the decade was that the refugees weren't fleeing violence, they came here for jobs. The joys of dishwashing were lures too great. Every Central American refugee whose case had negative judgments in the 1980s is now entitled to rehearings. The INS agrees not to submit to State Department Latin American policies in refugee applications, in case any Abrams underlings could still be hanging on and recycling the old dogma. In addition to $ 200,000 being made available to churches and service groups to locate refugees who are hiding, the settlement requires that immigration judges and asylum officials receive training in human-rights issues. The trainers are to be chosen by the church and service groups. A visit to Casa Companera might be helpful, if opening officials' eyes and minds or touching hearts is needed. They could listen to Anita, a 25-year-old widow from Jacaltenango in the western highlands of Guatemala. She fled a year ago after her husband was slain by gunmen. Earlier her husband's father and two brothers were killed. Anita slipped through the barb-wired border near Nogales in northwest Mexico and south Arizona. Picked by INS officials in a highway check, she spent three months in confinement until a friendly lawyer looked at her case and worked to reduce her bond from $ 2,000 to $ 500. Church groups helped out and offered refuge at Casa Companera. Last year, 100 other Anitas stayed here, with another 300 served in outreach programs for jobs or permanent housing. The sanctuary workers of the 1980s struggle on. As long as Central America remains in chaos and U.S. policy isn't radically improved, they will have to.",1991,"Guatemala"
"306","Indian-White Rape Case Splits Brazil","LA","With his yellow parrot headdress, Paulinho Paiakan has emerged in recent years as a worldwide symbol of Brazilian Indians' defense of their Amazon homelands. ""A new Gandhi,"" proclaimed Anita Roddick, who purchases Brazil nut oil from the Kaiapo Indian chief for her international cosmetics chain, the Body Shop. ""A man who would save the world,"" the American magazine Parade trumpeted last April in a cover profile of the powerfully built Kaiapo with shoulder-length hair and piercing black eyes. International awards, television appearances in the United States and a heroic role in a children's cartoon series were all to culminate this fall with the filming of a $40 million Hollywood version of Mr. Paiakan's life, directed by Ridley Scott. Accused on June 2 Then, a bruised and battered 18-year-old woman appeared June 2 at a police station in Redencao, 1,000 miles northwest of here. She accused the 37-year-old chief of raping her in the back seat of his Chevette, a charge the chief denies. ""Explosion of savage instinct,"" said the headline in Brazil's largest selling news weekly, Veja, which broke the story on its June 10 cover. ""The chief symbol of ecological purity tortures and rapes a white high school girl."" The ensuing uproar has bared Brazilian attitudes toward rape, race and Indian rights. Today, feminists are fighting anthropologists, who in turn are fighting Brazilian press barons for supposedly inciting an anti-Indian backlash. The young woman, a Portuguese language tutor for the chief's three children, charged that after a long day of drinking at a barbecue he attacked her and forced her to have sex with him, causing her to lose her virginity. Granted Numerous Interviews The woman, Silvia Leticia Ferreira, has been widely identified by Brazilian news organizations and has granted numerous television and press interviews about the case; she has also allowed photographs of the bruises she said were inflicted in the attack. In initial press interviews, Mr. Paiakan admitted, then denied, having sex with the woman. Formally charged with rape, the Indian leader in a police deposition June 19 again denied that he ever had sex with the woman. Instead, he said that his wife, Irekran, grew jealous of the younger woman and raped her with her fingers. [On Tuesday, a presiding judge received a police report that affirmed that Ms. Ferreira's underwear was stained with her blood and with Mr. Paiakan's sperm.] The chief awaits trial while under house arrest in his native village, A-Ukre. A cause celebre in Brazil, the chief's defense has been taken up by a legal team led by Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh, a human rights lawyer who is Deputy Mayor of Sao Paulo. Legally a Ward of the State Feminists assert that the Kaiapo chief is hiding behind his wife, knowing that she cannot be indicted. Because she does not speak Portuguese and is only vaguely familiar with Western ways, she is legally considered a ward of the state and cannot be tried in Brazilian courts. The chief, on the other hand, attended missionary school, speaks Portuguese reasonably well, has a bank account, owns an airplane and a city house, drives his own pickup truck, and has traveled overseas, mostly recently to London last April. Many anthropologists fear that the rape charge against the Kaiapo chief is being used to discredit Brazil's Indian rights movement and their foreign backers. Group Founded by Rock Star ""We are all worried that the Paiakan affair is being used by people who have designs on the wealth of the Indian territories,"" said Olympio Serra, an anthropologist who is president of the Brazilian Rain Forest Foundation, a Kayapo support group founded by Sting, the British rock star. Anthropologists say rape is rare among the Kaiapo. Traditionally, rape was restricted to warfare against outside groups. ""If a rape occurred, it was a reflection of his living among white people,"" said Darcy Ribeiro, a Rio anthropologist. Mr. Paiakan and other Kaiapo chiefs are caught between both worlds. Often touted as ""Brazil's wealthiest Indians,"" the 5,000 Kaiapo earn millions of dollars a year in royalties from gold and mahogany extracted from an archipelago of reserves stretching over 42,500 miles in central Brazil. Responsible for nearly half the economic activity in Redencao, the chiefs have second households and often indulge in sexual liaisons with local women. A Rarely Punished Crime Traditionally in Brazil, rape is an underreported and rarely punished crime. For example, in nearby Ceara state, 930 rapes against girls under 18 were reported in 1990. Of these cases, only six led to arrests. Mr. Paiakan also said he is being persecuted. ""Why aren't gold miners who rape and murder Yanomami women punished?"" he demanded of reporters, referring to northern Amazon tribe whose lands are frequently invaded by gold seekers. ""Is this law only for me?"" Marcos Terena, an Indian spokesman, said, ""When a white man rapes an Indian woman, there is never any scandal."" In a growing backlash against the Indians, more and more Brazilians say the Government is bottling up vast amounts of timber and minerals by recognizing huge reserves to shelter Brazil's 225,000 indigenous people -- about 1.5 percent of this impoverished nation's population. Under Brazilian law, logging and mining in Indian reserves can occur only with tribal permission and by paying royalties. Although daunting legislative hurdles remain before the reserve could be abolished, the vote reflects regional dissatisfaction over setting aside a mineral-rich area larger than Portugal for 10,000 Indians. In another action last week, 2,000 settler families invaded a 650-square-mile ranch in a frontier town near Redencao. During the Earth Summit, an Italian oil company, under pressure from Italian and Brazilian human rights groups, gave up its 25-year-old title to the land and announced the return of the ranch to its traditional inhabitants, the Xavante tribe. Racial tensions are also high in Redencao, where Paulinho Paiakan maintains a townhouse and a small farm. ""An Indian's place is in his village, a rapist's place is in jail,"" read a banner carried by protesters through streets of Redencao, in early June. In reprisal, Kaiapo Indians sacked a store, blocked the airstrip to A-Ukre, and temporarily trapped 3,000 loggers and gold miners on Indian lands. Recalling that Kaiapo Indians killed 22 white squatters in 1981 and rioted at Redencao's hospital in 1990, residents of the Amazon town panicked at rumors that Indians would invade and burn the courthouse. To defuse tensions, Redencao's Mayor banned liquor sales to Indians, banned sound trucks by protesters, and arranged the Kaiapo's trial to be shifted to more neutral territory, Maraba, a town 210 miles to the north.

"307","Haiti Adds Rape To Asylum Claims","LA","To the Editor: Your June 26 report on the difficulty Haitian rape victims face in proving their asylum claims, as detailed in the case of an activist who fled after having been assaulted by four police agents, highlights the inadequacy of our present asylum system in dealing with the claims of women. Women and children constitute 80 percent of the world's refugees. In many countries, women are subjected to gender-specific types of persecution, including rape, genital mutilation, bride burning, infanticide and forced abortion or sterilization. You point out the difficulty asylum applicants face in proving rape. While it is possible to qualify for asylum based on testimony alone, rape victims must overcome the effects of psychological trauma and cultural prohibitions against discussing such topics with male asylum officers or in the presence of male family members. Such cultural and psychological obstacles may unfairly discredit an applicant's testimony. This year, the Women Refugees Project of Harvard Law School's Cambridge and Somerville Legal Services drafted guidelines for the adjudication of women's asylum claims. The guidelines, endorsed by 36 organizations and individuals (including my association) were presented to the Immigration and Naturalization Service; that agency will shortly issue its own guidelines based on the Harvard model. We may hope the new guidelines will make it possible for women such as those you describe to escape the tyranny of sexual brutality in Haiti and elsewhere. JEFFREY S.

"309","Rape and Murder Stalk Women in Northern Mexico","LA","Juarez is a city of factories set in the Chihuahua desert, with most of the assembly lines worked by women. And one or perhaps several sexual predators are prowling its vast industrial parks and honky-tonk saloons where workers go to kick back. At least 70 women, many of them manufacturing workers, have been raped and murdered and their bodies dumped in the Chihuahua desert over the last five years. Twice, authorities have charged suspects with multiple homicide and declared the problem solved. But Juarez women keep dying; a dozen bodies have turned up amid the cactus already this year, and five more have been reported missing.  On April 16, the body of an unidentified teen-age girl, raped and strangled, was discovered under a railroad trestle, the Juarez police said. The murders have shone a spotlight not only on the victimization of women in a city that runs on their $3-a-day labor, but also on the growing influence of a fledgling women's movement galvanized into action by the sexual attacks. Many young women drawn here by Juarez's 400 tax-free maquiladora assembly plants break with the conservative customs of their rural villages, often pooling resources to live with other women and pursuing an independent social life. Feminist groups and congresswomen say they believe the violence is fed by a male backlash, and they criticize the stumbling official investigation of the killings as an example of mismanagement, mediocrity and machismo. ""Juarez is the ideal place to kill a woman, because you're certain to get away with it,"" said Astrid Gonzalez Davila, a founder of the Citizens Committee Against Violence, a group that works with the relatives of murder victims. ""The failure to solve these killings is turning the city into a mecca for homicidal maniacs."" Juarez has always been violent, but previously there was no reason to suspect that the murders of women were part of a chain of related events. The government says that 95 women have been murdered in this city of 1 million residents in five years; feminist groups have counted 118. The killings have become a national scandal and have put pressure on the Governor of Chihuahua, Francisco Barrio Terrazas, for a stepped-up investigation. In an interview, Mr. Barrio said the murder rate for women is no higher than for most other Mexican cities (although Juarez women are twice as likely to be murdered as New York City women) and defended his government's inquiry. ""It's been very well handled,"" he said. But several Mexican federal congresswomen who traveled to Juarez in February on a fact-finding mission disagreed. ""This investigation has left a bad taste in our mouth,"" said Representative Laura Itzel Castillo. ""There's been no professionalism."" The murders first attracted attention in 1993, when a criminology professor at the Chihuahua State police academy, Oscar Maynez Grijalva, noticed that virtually all the victims were poor, young, slender women with cinnamon skin and long dark hair. He tried to persuade Chihuahua officials that a serial killer was loose but he was ignored. He later resigned in protest. ""The authorities were just indifferent,"" said Irma Perez Franco, the mother of a 20-year-old shoe store clerk who was murdered in 1985. The police treated her with disdain from the moment she reported her daughter's disappearance, she said. ""This didn't matter to them at all."" Mrs. Perez finally persuaded detectives to question her daughter's co-workers to determine who had seen her last. ""But all they wanted to do was look at the cowboy boots and flirt with the clerks,"" she said. ""They had no investigative plan."" During the same weeks in which Mrs. Perez's daughter was killed, eight other bodies were discovered in one stretch of desert, and the public began to clamor for police action. In October 1995, authorities arrested Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist, after a Juarez prostitute accused him of raping her at his home. The authorities discovered that in the 1980's, before moving to Juarez in 1994, Mr. Sharif had been convicted twice of sexual assault in Florida. He had served six years of a 12-year sentence for the second crime, the beating and rape of his live-in housekeeper in Gainesville. The authorities announced that they had found the Juarez predator. They charged Mr. Sharif with the murder of six women, but a judge dismissed those charges in 1986. The day of Mr. Sharif's release, prosecutors filed new charges, accusing him of the murder of another woman. In an interview at his prison quarters here, Mr. Sharif acknowledged that he frequented bars where some murder victims have been kidnapped, but said, ""Raping and killing people is not my business."" Irene Blanco, a Juarez woman whom Mr. Sharif has appointed as his advocate said: ""The authorities needed a scapegoat and chose Sharif."" The police in Florida, however, have urged Mexican authorities not to release Mr. Sharif. ""He's demonstrated himself to be a vicious predator of women,"" said Capt. Sadie Darnell of the Gainesville police. Mr. Sharif's guilt is debated hotly in Juarez. But what is indisputable is that since his arrest the killings have continued. In April 1996, the authorities raided several bars and detained nearly 200 Juarez youths, including Sergio Armendariz, a 28-year-old nightclub security guard, along with several members of a gang he was said to lead. Mr. Armendariz and half a dozen others were later charged with murdering 17 women. But the integrity of the investigation came under attack when Chihuahua human rights officials accused the police of torturing several Juarez teen-agers to coerce their testimony against the gang members. In a prison interview, Mr. Armendariz said that after his arrest the police battered him for days, demanding that he sign a confession. ""They beat me until they got tired of beating me,"" he said. Jorge Lopez Molinar, the state's attorney in charge of the investigations, charged that the police had matched bite marks on several victims' bodies to Mr. Armendariz's teeth. But since Mr. Armendariz's detention, the bodies of at least nine raped women have been found in the desert. Mr. Lopez acknowledged that about half a dozen recent murders fit a pattern of serial murder. Robert K. Ressler, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who specialized in serial murder, said investigators should remain alert to the possibility that a psycopath is traveling to Juarez from the United States. ""You could have a guy in the U.S. who goes down there periodically to do these things,"" he said. In recent months, women's groups have staged protests accusing Chihuahua authorities of ignoring signs that a sexual predator remains on the loose. A leader has been Esther Chavez Cano, an accountant who pieced together a detailed list of victims that has helped their families monitor the investigation. Mrs. Chavez said that machismo, rooted in a popular culture across northern Mexico that glorifies ruthless desert horsemen who force women into submission, may be stronger here than elsewhere in the country. Yet in recent decades, thousands of women have taken factory jobs in Juarez and the numbers of single mothers have surged. ""Women have not become liberated, they just have a double workload,"" but some men resent what they perceive as women's newly independent lifestyles, she said. ""A patriarchal backlash has accompanied these murders,"" Ms. Chavez said. Authorities often suggest that murdered women have invited attack by wearing mini-skirts or going out dancing, she said. ""They minimize the crimes and blame the victims,"" Mrs. Chavez said. Map of Mexico showing location of Ciudad Juarez: A sexual predator or predators are on the prowl in Ciudad Juarez.",1998,"Mexico"
"310","Held as Head of Cocaine Ring, Woman Is to Face U.S. Court","LA","A Colombian woman who was accused of running a lucrative cocaine organization in which the top ranks were filled by women has been extradited from Brazil and is expected to appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan today, law enforcement sources said yesterday. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had accused the woman, Mery Valencia, 44, of leading a drug operation that sold $50 million worth of cocaine in New York, California, Florida and the Midwest since 1990, according to a Federal indictment. She had been in custody in Brazil since her arrest in February 1997. The cocaine operation included a highly sophisticated money laundering scheme, and used a ring of drug dealers in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan to distribute the cocaine in New York, according to the documents. But what made the Valencia organization unusual -- if not unique -- was its female leadership. Virtually every one of Ms. Valencia's lieutenants were women, and some of those women brought their daughters into the operation, the indictment says. In all, Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged about 60 people in the case, including more than a dozen women. Many of the 60 have been arrested, although most of the women who were accused of holding senior positions in Ms. Valencia's organization remain at large, according to the records. Ms. Valencia seems to have relied primarily on women in her family, the documents indicate. For example, one of her top aides was her sister, Luz Dary Valencia Castrillon, whom the indictment describes as a manager in the cocaine conspiracy who was responsible for arranging to have the proceeds of the cocaine sales deposited in American banks. Another subordinate was Ms. Valencia's sister-in-law, Ana Maria Valencia, whom the indictment accused of managing deliveries and pickups of money in the United States. Both women remain at large, the records show. The indictments do not say whether Ms. Valencia is married, nor how she started her operation, which the records say she ran from an office in Cali, Colombia. According to the records, she obtained American citizenship in Florida in May 1983. At her arrest in February 1997, at the airport in Rio De Janeiro, Ms. Valencia told the Brazilian authorities that she was involved in selling body lotion and that a ledger with names and amounts of money that she was carrying was a list of customers and what they owed her. But Federal drug enforcement agents said in a court affidavit that the ledger was a list of the members of her organization, whom they were able to identify because the same names turned up in telephone conversations between the conspirators that were wiretapped by the Government. Ms. Valencia was extradited to the United States after losing a legal appeal in Brazil, law enforcement sources said. Lawyers who represented her there could not be located by telephone for comment. A spokesman for Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, refused to comment. Prosecutors from her office have said in court that the charges stemmed from an investigation that included highly placed informants inside the organization. Last April, when Ms. White's office announced the charges against Ms. Valencia and more than 50 others in the conspiracy, Ms. White said that Federal agents had seized more than 200 kilograms of cocaine, and that $6.7 million in cash was also seized or identified as having been used during the two-year investigation. A separate indictment issued in 1994 by the United States Attorney's office in Los Angeles dates Ms. Valencia's drug trafficking as far back as 1986. That indictment accuses Ms. Valencia of shipping thousands of kilograms of cocaine across the Mexican border, and storing it in stash houses in Southern California. If convicted, Ms. Valencia could face a maximum term of life in prison on the charges, prosecutors said.",1998,"Brazil"
"311","Editorial Observer; Machismo Gives Good New Laws a Black Eye","LA","In March, Daniel Ortega's 30-year-old stepdaughter, Zoilamerica Narvaez, stunned Nicaragua with her charges that the former President had been sexually abusing her since she was a child. Her detailed and anguished story, which Mr. Ortega denies, has dominated Nicaragua's news and gossip. Mr. Ortega will probably not face trial, as a judge ruled this week that he has parliamentary immunity. But more surprising, the charges have sparked no broader discussion on sexual abuse. Last month Mr. Ortega was re-elected, nearly unanimously, as head of the Sandinista Front, in a convention where the charges were never mentioned. Since their birth in the 1970's, Latin American women's groups have won some important protections for women from domestic and sexual violence. Laws have vastly improved in the last five years, in part due to an inter-American convention on the subject. Police and courts sometimes even enforce them. But machismo still reigns. Sexual and physical abuse is common among all social classes in Latin America. It is less and less acceptable to say so publicly, but many people, including many women, still view women as men's property. They see sexual violence as besmirching the honor of a woman and, if she is married, the honor of the husband to whom she belongs. This view is still found in the law.  In at least 10 countries, a rapist can escape punishment by marrying his victim. Her family often pressures her into agreeing, to restore her honor and assure a husband for a woman considered tainted. In Brazil, juries still acquit men who killed wives they suspected were straying, on grounds that they were defending their honor. In many countries, courts will not convict respected men for beating their wives -- in the unlikely event a woman presses charges. One of the most successful and creative ideas for preventing violence against women bears replicating worldwide. Brazil has police stations with all-female staffs, specializing in violence against women. When the first one opened in 1985, 500 women were waiting in line, many with broken arms or black eyes. There are now close to 200 such stations in Brazil, most of them in the relatively wealthy state of Sao Paulo. Because of them, women's advocates say, even male officers now take domestic violence more seriously. The women's stations have also helped educate the public that it is not a man's right to beat his wife. A visit to a station in Sao Paulo a few years ago was a lesson in how little women expect. The police chief told me of a woman who had come in the week before. She was 70. Her husband began to beat her six months into their 39-year marriage. She finally brought him to the police because he broke her arm with a pressure cooker. The husband told the chief it was normal to slap your wife when she didn't obey. As the officer explained the law to him, however, he seemed to realize this was wrong. Later that day, the wife came back to tell the chief that her husband was taking her out to dinner for the first time in her life. ""We're going out for pizza,"" she said, her eyes filled with tears.",1998,"Brazil"

"313","16 Charged With Forcing Mexicans Into Prostitution","LA","Sixteen members of a Mexican family operation headquartered in Veracruz were accused yesterday of luring young women to the United States with the promise of a better life and then forcing them into prostitution to pay off their smuggling fees. The Mexican women, some as young as 14, were sent to brothels in Florida and South Carolina where they often had to work six days a week and were subjected to physical and sexual assault if they tried to escape, the Justice Department said. A federal grand jury in Fort Pierce, Fla., laid out the charges in a 52-count indictment that coincided with Attorney General Janet Reno's announcement in Washington of a new interagency task force to crack down on worker exploitation and modern-day slavery. ""Slavery is one of history's worst moments,"" Reno told reporters here. ""But it isn't just history."" She cited cases ranging from the involuntary servitude of 60 deaf Mexicans forced to peddle key chains in New York to the enticement of Thai citizens to California, where armed guards forced them to work 20-hour shifts in a garment factory. Reno said the task force would be headed by Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, and Marvin Krislov, acting solicitor at the Labor Department. She said the group would seek to improve interagency coordination in worker exploitation cases, set up a central information bank where investigators can compare leads and exchange tips and ""establish a blueprint"" for addressing victims' needs. Lee said some of the cases coming to light involve migrant workers, including U.S. citizens, but most of them seem to involve undocumented workers from Mexico and other countries. Asked if plans to encourage victims to speak up would include guarantees against deportation, Lee said that would be considered ""on a case-by-case basis."" Reno added: ""We don't want to create a blanket opportunity. We need to maintain appropriate enforcement of the immigration laws."" In the Florida case, the 14 victims referred to in the indictment, including three minors, have been declared material witnesses, released on bond, and given temporary legal status for a year while the case is pending. Officials could not say what would happen to them after that. The 16 defendants include six members of a family headed by Rogerio Cadena, and 10 associates. They were accused of involuntary servitude, civil rights conspiracy, extortion and transportation of women across state lines for immoral purposes, and in some counts, face life sentences.",1998,"Mexico"
"314","Feminist Propels Outcry at Brutal Mexico Killings","LA","Within hours after youths passing by a Juarez drainage canal on a recent day discovered the body of a 13-year-old girl, the most recent victim in a long series of sexual killings here, Esther Chavez Cano was rushing to spread the dismal news. She was on the phone to members of the feminist organization she heads. She was typing E-mail messages to congresswomen and journalists. And in news interviews, Ms. Chavez, a 65-year-old former accountant for Kraft Foods, was accusing the new Governor of Chihuahua of breaking campaign promises made last year to investigate the killings of women in Juarez more seriously than his predecessor did. ""It's outrageous that these murders have been used to win votes, but the minute the politicians get in power they forget about the dead women,"" Ms. Chavez said. The victim, Irma Angelica Rosales, was raped and smothered with a plastic bag on Feb. 16, hours after she lost her $4-a-day job in an American-owned factory. She became the third such victim in this border city that faces El Paso since Gov. Patricio Martinez Garcia took office in October. But a grisly trail of similar crimes preceded Miss Rosales's killing. Authorities have counted 184 women killed in Juarez since 1993. About 80 were raped and their bodies dumped in the desert. State officials say only 24 fit a pattern of serial sexual murder, but Ms. Chavez, who keeps detailed lists of the dead on her home computer, says she believes the figure is far higher. Just a few years back, as battered female bodies turned up here frequently, dumped in desert gullies and vacant lots, these crimes gained little notice. Even now, few of the killings have been solved. But this latest killing provoked considerable outrage, which is a testimony to Ms. Chavez's outspoken advocacy and the fledgling feminist movement she helps lead. Juarez newspapers made the young woman's death front-page news. Television editorials urged authorities to stop the violence. Demonstrations have been scheduled to protest the killing. As outrage grew, Governor Martinez offered a $5,000 reward for information identifying the sexual predator. The continuing sexual murders pose a challenge to Governor Martinez, who is a member of President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party. He won election last year partly by lambasting his predecessor, from the opposition National Action Party, for investigative mismanagement. Arturo Gonzalez Rascon, Chihuahua's Attorney General, said his government had made prosecuting the murders a priority. New initiatives, including restrictions on liquor sales and beefed-up police patrols, have reduced crime, and a shake-up of the unit investigating homicides in which women are the victims has increased efficiency, he said in a letter responding to written questions. ""We've made good advances,"" he said. In response to Miss Rosales's killing, he said. ""We've assigned our best elements to its investigation."" But on Wednesday there was a setback when two Mexico City criminologists invited to Chihuahua to help out by the Martinez administration resigned in protest, asserting that the sexual homicide inquiries are in chaos, with case files and lab tests missing and inexperienced detectives in charge. ""Governor Martinez told us that he'd appoint better investigators, but the officials he's named are worse than those they replaced,"" Representative Alma Vucovich, president of the Mexican Congress's Committee on Sexual Equality, said in an interview. ""The bodies keep appearing and neither the Governor nor the police seem to care."" Many victims, like Miss Rosales, had migrated to Juarez from cities to the south. She arrived in January, moving into a mud shanty with her brother. He paid $20 for a false document stating that she was 16, enabling her to get an assembly job at the plant where his wife worked, Electrocomponentes de Mexico. She had trouble adjusting to factory discipline, and on Feb. 10 was suspended for a day for talking. On the morning of Feb. 16 she quit her job, plant officials said, but her sister-in-law said Miss Rosales told her in a tearful conversation at the plant that she had been dismissed. ""Go straight home on the bus,"" the sister-in-law said she told Miss Rosales. ""Don't walk, its dangerous."" The teen-ager left about 9 A.M. Two youths found her body six hours later in a ditch a mile away after she had been raped and killed. Dozens of young factory women have been attacked walking through Juarez's desolate industrial parks, and Ms. Chavez's organization has urged owners to provide secure transportation. Thomas Creevey, an executive at the International Wire Group, based in Mishawaka, Ind., which owns Electrocomponentes, said the plant provided no bus service. He called Miss Rosales's salary ""confidential,"" but her relatives said that during seven days of work she earned $27. Ms. Chavez heard of the killing hours after it occurred, when a television crew came to interview her about it. Ms. Chavez was about to retire from her accounting career about the time the sexual murders began here in the early 1990's, and dismayed by officials' indifference, she began to speak out. She drew attention with criticisms of male investigators and politicians, who argued that women were inviting attack by wearing suggestive clothing. She attacked machismo, whose roots in a Chihuahua culture that glorifies ruthless desert horsemen who force women into submission may make it even stronger than elsewhere in Mexico. She became an advocate for working-class women whose brutalization was passing unchallenged to a degree inconceivable had the Juarez dead been drawn from a higher station. ""She seemed very audacious,"" said Guadalupe Ramirez Lopez, director of a Juarez human rights group, who recalled seeing the short, slender Ms. Chavez stand to criticize a state prosecutor in 1995. ""She was the only one daring to demand better investigations."" Her criticisms of the official inquiries have been widely accepted. Chihuahua officials recently acknowledged that the state police have never even assembled a psychological profile of the serial killer or killers. That may change. The Federal Bureau of Investigation agreed this month to send profilers to Juarez to study the case, a spokesman in El Paso said. Despite the increasing uproar, the Chihuahua police remain sloppy and indifferent, Ms. Chavez said. She cited the experience of Armine Arjona Baca, a physician, who told her story in a separate interview. During the night of Jan. 31, Dr. Arjona heard the screams of a woman in terror and pain coming from a canal behind her house, and phoned the state police. The officer who answered argued that it was not his agency's job to respond to emergencies but promised, grudgingly, to send a squad car. It never arrived. Dr. Arjona called back 30 minutes later. ""Is that woman still screaming?"" the agent responded, irritated, Dr. Arjona said. A woman's body was found later that day elsewhere in Juarez. It is unclear whether the cries Dr. Arjona heard came from the murder victim. Miss Rosales's killing threw Ms. Chavez's life into tumult as the teen-ager's family reached out to her for help. She held their hands in angry meetings with bureaucrats who delayed releasing Miss Rosales's body, and as coffin vendors tried to profiteer on the funeral. ""Yesterday was a nightmare,"" she wrote in an E-mail she distributed on Feb. 20, the day after Miss Rosales's body was shipped to her hometown for burial. ""The anguish of these poor people. I was in a volcano of pain.""  http://www.nytimes.com Map of Mexico shows location of Ciudad Juarez: Ciudad Juarez is outraged over the latest in a series of sexual killings.",1999,"Mexico"

"316","Who Is Killing the Young Women of Juarez? A Filmmaker Seeks Answers","LA","Over the last decade more than 300 women have disappeared from the streets of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, many later found raped and murdered, their bodies dumped in ditches and the desert. But even more stunning than the number of deaths has been the failure of law enforcement officials to put a stop to the killings. A trail of newspaper articles about the murders led Lourdes Portillo, a San Francisco filmmaker who was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, not far from Juarez, to this unsolved mystery just across the border from El Paso. Initially, she said, her intention was to profile some of the victims and create a memorial to ""these girls,"" but soon she found herself trying to figure out what happened to them and why. ""I'm not a journalist, but it was so compelling to try to find out what really happened,"" Ms. Portillo said in a telephone interview from her home in San Francisco. Her search for answers is chronicled in ""Senorita Extraviada"" (""Missing Young Woman""), a documentary to be shown tomorrow night on PBS. The film has already won several awards, including a special jury prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival. Even more rewarding, Ms. Portillo said, is that the film may lead to action. With her blessing it is being shown to politicians, human rights activists and student groups to rally support in both Mexico and the United States for a more thorough investigation of the deaths. The cases date back to 1993, when high school and college students, store clerks and housewives, as well as the poor single women drawn to Juarez from all over Mexico to work in hundreds of mostly American-owned maquiladoras, or assembly plants, began vanishing from the streets, often in daylight, on their way home from work or to visit friends or to job interviews. At first officials faulted the women themselves, saying that the victims moved in ""high-risk"" circles of gang members and prostitution. But as shown in the documentary, which includes pictures of scores of the women and visits with some of their families, the only obvious pattern is that most of the victims were poor, dark-skinned and slim with shoulder-length hair. Ms. Portillo's interviews with relatives of the victims, Mexican law-enforcement officials and women who survived their attacks indicate that there are many theories about who can be behind so many deaths: serial killers, drug traffickers, opportunists emboldened to commit copycat murders. One woman, Maria Talamantez, even points at police officers, saying that when she went to report the beating of her husband by neighbors, a group of officers at the station raped her and showed her graphic pictures of some of the murdered women as they were killed. Relatives of the victims and women's advocates also discuss evidence that some of the women may have been targeted inside the maquiladoras where they worked. But more significant to Ms. Portillo, who wrote, produced, directed and narrated the film, is why the murders are still happening. Even in the lawlessness of Juarez, a city of 1.2 million people and a center for drug trafficking, Ms. Portillo argued that the lack of progress in catching the culprits reflected an almost cavalier attitude toward the victims. ""There's an element that the women are not worth the trouble,"" she said. ""There's an incredible disregard for poor, brown women. There's a racist attitude and a classist attitude."" Few of the killings have been solved. Repeatedly Mexican authorities have arrested and charged suspects, including members of a Mexican gang, bus drivers on routes serving the maquiladoras and an Egyptian-born chemist with a record of sexual battery in the United States who worked at one of the assembly plants. But a lack of evidence has hampered the prosecution of cases. (The Egyptian suspect, Abdel Latif Sharif Sharif, was convicted in 1996 of murder, but a court later overturned that conviction, although he remains in custody.) And each time, as the officials have declared the problem solved, the murders have continued. In the course of 18 months of filming in 1999 and 2000, Ms. Portillo said, 50 more women were killed. The film notes that many bodies have shown evidence of torture and mutilation, fueling bizarre rumors and speculation about ritual sacrifices. Ms. Portillo said she herself felt ""very unsafe"" and that the sister of a woman she had interviewed, for example, disappeared not long after the interview. ""I had the paranoid feeling that the deaths were coming close to me,"" she said. Ms. Portillo said she came away convinced that the killers come from the drug trade and remained at large because ""they have the power to buy everyone off."" She said she believed there was a ""pyramid of complicity."" Relatives of the victims and women's groups say the cases have been hampered by contaminated or destroyed evidence, threats against witnesses and police corruption and incompetence. They have organized to put pressure on the government to start a federal investigation. There are also calls for American law-enforcement officials to investigate; some criminal profilers suspect the killers may be crossing into the United States to avoid detection. The agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in El Paso, Hardrick Crawford Jr., who recently met with Mexican officials on the matter, has called the slayings ""a crime against humanity"" and endorsed a binational task force, The El Paso Times reported. Clemencia Prieto, co-chairwoman of the Coalition Against Violence Toward Women and Families on the Border, an El Paso-based group that was formed to call attention to the deaths, said the film was helping generate awareness of ""the tragedy of the situation."" She said that in El Paso it has been shown to University of Texas students and at fund-raisers for women's groups. ""Many people didn't know the magnitude of the problem,"" she said. ""It's had tremendous impact."" Ms. Portillo, 58, has explored other murders and what she calls ""the dark side of our psyche"" in 23 years as a filmmaker. Her 1985 documentary ""Las Madres: The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo,"" which was nominated for an Oscar, is about the mothers of victims of political repression in Argentina in the 1970's. In ""The Devil Never Sleeps"" (1994) she investigated the mysterious death of a multimillionaire uncle, and in ""Corpus: A Home Movie for Selena"" (1999) she examined the impact that the slain singer Selena Quintanilla had on her fans. But ""Senorita Extraviada,"" she said, has been unique in the magnitude and seeming hopelessness of the situation. ""This one really got me down because it's something that's ongoing and has no end in sight,"" she said. ""It's incredible what's happening,"" she added. ""It's disgusting.""",2002,"Mexico"
"317","A Mexican Mystery","LA","To the Editor: The shocking story of the killings of as many as 600 young women in and around Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (front page, Dec. 10), deserves attention on both sides of the border. Your article notes that bodies of victims were deposited near ""offices of the principal maquiladora association,"" but says nothing about what the association is doing about the problem. Yet it is clear that the murders are intimately tied to the presence of the maquiladoras and their policy of recruiting very large numbers of young women workers, many of whom are living far from families that would protect them. The maquiladora associations themselves should recognize a responsibility to provide protective social services for their vulnerable female workers. They should be providing full information about the risks of the environment that they themselves have created. LAWRENCE CRANBERG Austin, Tex., Dec. 10, 2002",2002,"Mexico"
"318","Wave of Women's Killings Confounds Juarez","LA","It has been seven years since Irma Perez steamed a plate of her daughter's favorite vegetables and waited all night for her to come home from work. Weeks later, a bag of bones was the only answer she got back from the police to explain why her daughter was missing. They lifted a chalky skull out of the bag and asked: is this your daughter's face? The bodies of many women and girls had begun to surface in the desert that surrounds this city like an ocean. Ms. Perez soon joined with other mothers in a quest for justice. But years of dead-end detective work, of public pleas for government action, of watching more daughters disappear have taken a toll on her body and mind. ""Why should she keep talking?"" interrupted Ms. Perez's father, who declined to give his name. ""She has told the story thousands of times. What has she gotten but pain? What progress has been made?"" Ms. Perez bowed her head, as if accepting her father's bitterness. Then she sat up straight and shook her head. ""I will never stop talking about Olga,"" she said. ""I cannot stop until the violence stops."" It has not stopped. Nearly 10 years after the start of the wave of killings, the mounting toll of dead and missing women in Ciudad Juarez has become one of this country's most vicious unsolved mysteries. At least 280 women and girls have been killed in this city on the American border since 1993, according to the police. The Chihuahua State authorities say at least 76 of them fell prey to serial killers. Women's leaders say that many families, distrustful of local authorities, are afraid to report crimes to the police and that the total of women and girls killed or missing is closer to 600. Most of the victims were between 15 and 25. They were students, store clerks and $6-a-day workers in assembly plants, called maquiladoras, that have turned Juarez into a city with two faces: one of gleaming industrial parks erected by Fortune 500 companies, the other of dust-covered shanties built by workers who migrate here to escape even more desperate lives down south. Their deaths have drawn hundreds of protests and expressions of international outrage, but the epidemic of violence against women here continues. In one week in November, four women were killed in drug-related and domestic violence. In October the bodies of two rape victims -- one a 13-year-old girl, the other a 20-year-old woman -- were found a few hundred yards from a Christ statue that towers outside the southwest edge of the city. Officials from the United Nations and other international organizations have visited the city and urged President Vicente Fox to intervene in the investigations, which critics say have been marred by official cover-ups and corruption. Relatives have led protests of thousands from Washington to Mexico City, including one in November. But Mr. Fox has refused to intervene, saying homicide is a state crime, not a federal one. ""I never dreamed 10 years ago that we would still be fighting the same fight,"" said Esther Chavez Cano, a leading women's advocate. Referring to El Paso, just across the Texas border, she added, ""If this had been happening just a few miles north, people would have risen up in arms to stop this killing. If these were rich girls, not poor ones, maybe officials here would pay attention."" State and local officials say women's groups have exaggerated the situation. ""The problem of violence against women is not only a problem for Ciudad Juarez,"" said the attorney general of Chihuahua, Jesus Solis. ""There are many other cities where the situation is worse."" Ciudad Juarez, one of the busiest drug corridors between Mexico and the United States, sits like a contorted carnival-mirror image of its sister city El Paso, which the F.B.I. rates as one of the safest big cities in the United States. Together they form a metropolitan area of 2.1 million people. But on the El Paso side the police reported 21 murders last year; Ciudad Juarez had more than 10 times that number. Finding explanations for the killings of the women here seems as easy as tracking a ghost. American and Mexican experts on serial killings agree that the violence in Juarez is not the work of a single psychopath, but on little else. Some see evidence of satanic cult killings in the patterns that were cut into some of the victims' scalps and the careful way some groups of bodies were laid in the desert. Some speculate that the murderers are organ smugglers or producers of snuff movies, who hide out on the United States side of the border. Others say the violence is a byproduct of deep social distress, marked by high rates of drug abuse, rampant police corruption and rising domestic violence as women have flocked here to work on assembly lines manufacturing products for the United States market. The city's 396 factories, known as maquiladoras, gave preference to women workers when they first began operating here in the late 1960's. Factory managers argued that women's hands were more agile and better suited to stitching together blue jeans or assembling small appliances. The managers could also pay women pittance salaries. While men had trouble finding work, a kind of feminist revolution was born. Women became principal breadwinners in border households. Some say their increased control over the family economy and over their own fate generated a backlash. Walking among pink and red wooden crosses laid in a city lot on the east side of the city, a women's leader, Vicky Caraveo, said: ""These are hate crimes. The way the killers mutilate the victims, the way they rape them in every possible way, the way they dump them like garbage."" The crosses mark a cotton field where the bodies of eight women were found a year ago, at the intersection of two busy four-lane boulevards, facing the offices of the principal maquiladora association. ""Here women's roles have changed 10,000 times compared with the rest of Mexico,"" Ms. Caraveo said. ""Meanwhile the men are not changing as quickly. And that is where some of the tension begins."" Marisela Ortiz, another leading activist, cautioned against blaming the city's chaotic social forces. ""The government uses that as an excuse,"" she said, ""as a way to evade its own responsibility to stop the violence."" She and other women's leaders charge that an entrenched culture of impunity is to blame for the violence. The police, they said, have falsified murder reports by classifying serial murders as isolated homicides. The women suspect that the real killers are linked to drug traffickers and other politically prominent families in Ciudad Juarez, who they say operate with police complicity. Women's leaders said the police had harassed, even killed, citizens who spoke out about their abuses. Just such questions were raised after the discoveries of the bodies in the cotton field. Josefina Gonzalez, 48, identified one of the bodies discovered there as that of her 20-year-old daughter, Claudia Ivette Gonzalez, who worked at a plant owned by the Lear Corporation. The body, mostly bones, was still wrapped in a Lear uniform. A square patch of hair had been cut from the back of the victim's head. The police arrested two bus drivers in connection with the murders and said they had admitted to the crimes. Later, in interviews with the Mexican press, the suspects, Victor Javier Garcia Uribe and Gustavo Gonzalez, said they had been tortured into making their confessions. Photos showed that the men had burn marks across their abdomens and genitals. In February police officers shot and killed the defense lawyer for one of the suspects. The officers said they had mistaken the lawyer for an armed fugitive; they have not been prosecuted in the shooting. DNA tests conducted on the slain women's bodies yielded no conclusive results, leaving gaping holes in the investigations and grieving relatives like Ms. Gonzalez to wonder whether they had buried the remains of a loved one or a stranger. A month later, the lead forensic investigator, Oscar Maynez, quit the state police, saying other agents had put pressure on him to plant false evidence against the bus drivers. ""The people in jail today are scapegoats, not serial killers,"" Mr. Maynez said in an interview. ""There is a systematic pattern by the police to repress the people they are sworn to protect."" Deputy Attorney General Carlos Vega said the federal authorities had offered technical assistance to the authorities in Ciudad Juarez. But homicides, he said, are not the jurisdiction of federal authorities unless there is evidence linking the murders to drug trafficking or other organized crime. No such evidence has been found, he said. Mr. Solis, the state attorney general, acknowledged that in many cases there was almost no evidence except a bag of bones. Nevertheless, he said, the investigations have been successful. In addition to the bus drivers, he said, the police have arrested the leaders of a violent street gang and also an Egyptian with a history of sex crimes in the United States, who has been charged with one murder. Mr. Solis also said Mexican officials had recently requested assistance from the F.B.I. Mexican officials had previously asked for F.B.I. help in 1999 but retracted the request, raising more questions about the government's commitment to finding the killers. During a meeting in Juarez, F.B.I. officials endorsed a binational investigation of the murders. Meanwhile, women who work in maquiladoras struggle to live normal lives. Riding the rickety bus that takes them home, workers for Delphi Automotive Systems talked about their fear when men approach them on the street. Men stop their cars and ask for directions, urging them to come close. Men offer rides home, and grope them on dance floors. One worker, Aureny Cuevas Martinez, 18, looked as if she could be going out on the town, her purple mascara turning neon in the sunset. Not at all, she said. She was going straight home. ""We do not like to live this way,"" she said. ""But the killings keep happening, and there is no one to protect us, except us.""",2002,"Mexico"

The sisters, who cannot speak, cry and crumple, and literally fold up, when asked how they got pregnant. Their babies are due at the same time, within a week or so. Do they know the man? Did it happen in the fields on their way home from school? Isabel seemed to try to reply once, to her grandmother, by pointing to a spot high on a mountainside before tears streamed down her face and she turned away again. Antonia is 13 years old, and Isabel 16. Perhaps if they were older, the pregnancies would have been easier to keep secret, the way rapes and beatings of women are usually dealt with in Mexico. But in this little town of fewer than 500 people, a place where the church bells toll every afternoon at 5 to call everyone to say the rosary, the reality is hard to hide. The girls' tiny frames swell more each day. Their backs and legs are sore -- not from playing tag with schoolmates, but because their bodies are telling them they will soon be mothers. ""This is a crime and there should be an investigation,"" said Juana Maria Diego Victor, a community leader in this village 85 miles northeast of Puebla city. ""Someone should protect these girls."" Mexico is struggling to modernize its justice system, but when it comes to punishing sexual violence against women, surprisingly little has changed in a century. In many parts of Mexico, the penalty for stealing a cow is harsher than the punishment for rape. Although the law calls for tough penalties for rape -- up to 20 years in prison -- only rarely is there an investigation into even the most barbaric of sexual violence. Women's groups estimate that perhaps 1 percent of rapes are ever punished. Although the two girls' medical charts say their pregnancies were the ""product of rape,"" no police authority has looked into the case. In recent decades, Mexico has made strides in improving women's rights and opportunities. Mexican women still have much higher illiteracy rates than men, but that is slowly changing as young girls are staying in school longer. During the 1990s, laws that trampled women's rights were abolished, such as those that said a married woman needed her husband's permission to hold a job outside the home. But in the country that made the term ""machismo"" famous, where women were given the right to vote only in 1953, women's rights advocates said rape and other acts of violence against women are still not treated as serious crimes. And they said police, prosecutors and judges often show indifference or hostility toward women who claim rape -- such as in the case of Yessica Yadira Diaz Cazares. Diaz testified that three police officers raped her in 1997, when she was 16, as she was on her way home from school in the northern city of Durango. She then did a rare thing: She tried to punish her attackers. When she went to the police station with her mother, she was jeered and then jailed overnight. The police forced her, as is mandatory in Mexico, to have a physical vaginal exam by a government doctor. They made her submit to eight separate blood tests, telling her, falsely, that the tests would determine whether she had been raped. But no one ever told her what the lab results were. When the teenager did not back off, even after her family received death threats, a prosecutor told her that to identify the officers who attacked her, she must physically lay her hand on them. It was not good enough to point out her attackers. She needed to touch them, she was instructed. When she reached out and touched an officer, he taunted her and told her she was crazy. Finally she gave up. She told her sister she was tired of seeking justice. Three months later, the young girl with big brown eyes and long, wavy hair killed herself with an overdose of prescription drugs. After her burial, the national human rights commission took up her case and helped convict two officers of rape. ""They make the few women who dare to report rape give up,"" said Yessica's mother, Maria Eugenia Cazares, who said her daughter's rape and death shattered the family's life. After her daughter's suicide, she moved her family to Canada, where, she said, there are more enlightened laws to protect women. ""In 90 percent of the cases of rape, the Mexican police blame the women,"" she said in an interview. ""In the few cases where they know the man is guilty, they let him 'fix' it with money."" She said she believes that a ""machismo culture,"" instilled through what is learned in the home, school and church, has allowed many men to ""believe they are superior and dominant, and that women are an object."" She said that mind-set has contributed to making many men -- including policemen, prosecutors, judges and others in positions of authority -- believe that sexual violence against women is no big deal. ""The thinking is 'she's a woman, so she deserved it,' or 'he's a man, so what do you expect?' "" said Cazares. Rape in Mexico is prosecuted at the state level, and state laws vary. A review of criminal laws in all 31 Mexican states showed that many states require that if a 12-year-old girl wants to accuse an adult man of statutory rape, she must first prove she is ""chaste and pure."" Nineteen of the states require that statutory rape charges be dropped if the rapist agrees to marry his victim. ""What message is this? That the crime is not serious,"" said Elena Azaola, author of ""The Crime of Being a Woman,"" a book about how the Mexican justice system discriminates against women. In order for a woman to file a criminal complaint alleging rape, she must submit to a medical exam by a doctor assigned by the prosecutor's office. Patricia Duarte, president of the Mexican Association Against Violence Against Women, said these exams, routinely conducted in the prosecutor's office, are often carried out with little sensitivity or privacy. The exams, she said, are an obstacle to reporting rape that contributes to ""impunity of rapists"" in Mexico. Whatever problems women face in the cities and towns, they are compounded in small villages where old customs are still the only true law. Ten million Mexicans are indigenous, as are most of the people in these highlands of the Sierra Madre. In Mexico's march toward modernity, there is great tension here between protecting women from violence and honoring indigenous customs. In many of the thousands of indigenous communities, by longstanding custom, women are essentially servants of their fathers, brothers and husbands. In many villages around Reyeshogpan, a woman is forbidden to go out after dusk without her husband or her husband's permission. After 7 p.m., streets in village after village are populated by men only, many of them drunk. Alcoholism is another problem that contributes to violence against women. Town elders who act as judges in local criminal matters are invariably men. In one village in Guerrero state, elders were recently asked how they punish rape. The six men looked confused, as if they did not know what the term meant. When it was explained to them, they all laughed and said it sounded more like a courting ritual than a crime. When they stopped laughing, they said a rapist would probably get a few hours in the local jail, or he might have to pay the victim's family a $ 10 or $ 20 fine, but that all would be forgotten if he and the victim got married. In the case of a cow thief, they said, the robber would be jailed. And, unlike the rapist, a cow thief would be brought before the elders for a lecture about the severity of the crime. In the southern state of Oaxaca last summer, the one-year-old, government-funded Oaxacan Women's Institute persuaded the legislature to pass heavy criminal penalties against a practice known as ""rapto."" Laws in most Mexican states define rapto as a case where a man kidnaps a woman not for ransom, but with the intent of marrying her or to satisfy his ""erotic sexual desire."" The new law championed by the women's group established penalties of at least 10 years in prison. But in March, the state legislature reversed itself and again made the practice a minor infraction. A key legislator -- a man -- argued for the reduction, calling the practice harmless and ""romantic."" Human rights groups disagree. They say it is not charming for a man to spot a woman he fancies sitting in a park, pick her up and carry her away to have sex with her. Yet to this day, that is still how some women meet their husbands. The attorney general's office said there have been 137 criminal complaints of rapto in the state of Puebla since January 2000. Complete statistics are impossible to find, because most cases are settled between the two families involved and never reported. Because rapto implies that the girl was taken away for sex, her parents want to avoid the shame associated with making a public complaint to police. In some cases, the girls voluntarily go with the man as a way to elope to avoid wedding expenses. But Gabriela Gutierrez Kleman, a lawyer with the Oaxacan Women's Institute, said in many cases the women are taken against their will. Gutierrez said it is hard to ask girls to complain about rapto, to buck a system that has changed little since their great-grandmothers' time. If they do, she said, the family or the community often ""treats them as outcasts."" The regional maternity hospital in Zacapoaxtla caters to women and children from scores of villages in the highlands here in the northeast corner of Puebla state. White-coated doctors and nurses scurry about among the crying children, past brightly painted walls decorated with basic information about nutrition, breast-feeding and sanitation. About 220 babies are born there each month, many of them to mothers who are children themselves. Hospital officials said babies are born there frequently to girls as young as 12, many of whom do not understand that intercourse caused their pregnancy. The pregnancy of a child that age implies a crime: In Puebla, it is illegal to have sex with a person younger than 18. But only rarely are rape charges filed in these cases. Teresa Arrieta Martinez, 13, petite and hugely pregnant, cringed as a nurse took a blood sample as part of her prenatal care. Her boyfriend, Eliazar Hernandez Martinez, a 20-year-old grocery store manager, stood outside in the waiting room. About seven months ago, when Teresa was 12, Hernandez had sex with her and she became pregnant. Because of her age, the law says that Hernandez committed statutory rape. But it was not the police who came after him; it was Teresa's mother, Maria Juana Martinez. ""He could go to jail. If he doesn't carry through on his promise to marry her, I'll have to report him,"" she said. ""I'll sue him if he fails her."" In most states marriage is a legal remedy for statutory rape. Women's groups say if the penalties were harsher, statutory rape cases would not be so common. As it is now, a man can agree to a wedding to avoid going to jail, and then abandon the woman. Social workers say many unhappy, abusive marriages begin with statutory rape. Any day, Antonia and Isabel, the two deaf sisters, are due to deliver their babies at the same hospital. Antonia, the 13-year-old, lives with her mother in a small house near the main road of Reyeshogpan, a tiny village with little more than a church, basketball court and general store. Antonia is carrying her baby in the breech position, so her doctors expect a difficult delivery. Isabel, 16, lives with her 95-year-old grandfather in a small wooden house nearby. It is at the bottom of a ravine lined with cornstalks, a challenging 30-minute climb straight down from where her mother, stepfather and sister live. No one seems quite sure how Isabel will be able to make the climb up to get to the hospital once she is in labor. Isabel passes her days sitting on a log at her front door, staring off into the cornfields or embroidering. She wears her silky brown hair neatly tied up, her white dress and apron are impeccably clean and she folds her hands nervously over her huge belly. The girls' mother, Ventura Melendez, 35, communicates with them using rudimentary sign language and drawings. When she asked Isabel if she had any pain, the girl put her arm against her lower back. She nodded when asked if she is scared about being such a young mother. Melendez said she prefers not to dwell on how they got pregnant. ""What happened to them happens to a lot of girls,"" she said. ""We don't want justice. We don't want trouble."" But Diego Victor, the neighbor who has known the girls since they were born, said she is angry that what happened to the girls will never be punished. ""They deserve better,"" she said.

"320","Of Human Bondage; From her desk, it's easy to see that slavery isn't yet history","LA","Laura Lederer is deputy director of the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, the first such office in U.S. history. I am certain that most people have never heard of this office, which tracks an underground criminal practice that is global in scope but not noticeable on the national agenda. It involves coercion and bondage and international cartels, and its victims are often children who are young enough to be playing in youth soccer leagues. It is, Lederer believes, the modern- day equivalent of slavery. When she is asked for the most horrific case she's ever encountered, Lederer doesn't hesitate: ""Rosa,"" she says. Rosa is the name under which the young woman's testimony was read into the Congressional Record; her real name was not disclosed to protect her and her family. In 1996, she was 13 and waiting tables in a restaurant near her home town of Veracruz, Mexico -- her family needed the money -- when a woman she knew told her she could make 10 times as much doing the same job in the States. The woman set up a meeting with two men, who told Rosa they had job openings in American restaurants and would handle her immigration papers. Though her parents were against it, Rosa persuaded them to let her go, and she met the men at a local hotel. There, her journey began. The men drove Rosa and several other young girls into the Mexican desert, where they were met by other men. For four days, they hiked across the desert, across a river and into Brownsville, Tex., where they were picked up and driven to Houston. From Houston, they were driven to Avon Park, Fla., and dropped off at a trailer. At the trailer, Rosa was told she had been sold to a brothel and would have to work off her debt by having sex with men. Rosa was a virgin. To initiate her into the business, to teach her about professional sex, her captors gang-raped her. The bosses had guns and knives, and they warned of grave consequences if she tried to escape. They threatened to harm her family back in Veracruz. She was under 24-hour guard. For the next six months, Rosa was shuttled from one trailer brothel to the next, forced to have sex with 10 to 15 men a day, in such demand because of her youth. Though the men were supposed to wear condoms, some didn't, and twice she got pregnant and had abortions. Rosa is Catholic. Rosa eventually escaped after one of the captive young women flung herself out a window and ran several miles for help. This sex-peddling ring was ultimately busted, one of the early successful such prosecutions in this country. When Lederer finishes recounting Rosa's story, she talks about ""making history."" History? ""Eradicating trafficking,"" Lederer says. Which won't be easy. ""You multiply that story by hundreds and hundreds of thousands worldwide and you have an idea of what we're up against."" At least 700,000 people, mostly women and children, are trafficked across international borders each year, according to U.S. government estimates. Some wind up at sweatshops, some at construction sites, some at brothels, all exploited. It is a lucrative enterprise -- the third-largest moneymaker for crime syndicates, right behind drugs and arms. An estimated 50,000 victims are trafficked to the United States each year. Two years ago, after Rosa and other exploited women gave their testimony, Congress passed a law cracking down on human trafficking, with a maximum penalty of 20 years to life for those convicted in this country, the threat of limited economic sanctions against nations that don't take trafficking seriously, and refuge from deportation for victims who would be in danger if they left the United States. The State Department's first report on the subject, issued last summer, lists 23 nations as not doing enough to eliminate trafficking. Among them are Greece, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. The next report is due in June. But Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), a prime sponsor of the new law, is not satisfied. ""We need a war-room mentality,"" he says. ""This is a war. This is sexual slavery in its most hideous form. This has to be dealt with not unlike the way we are fighting the war on terrorism."" For 15 years, Laura Lederer did research and wrote articles on the commercial sexual exploitation of women and children. She toiled in academia until she joined an unusual coalition of faith-based groups, children's rights advocates and women's groups to bring the trafficking issue to the attention of Congress. Now, she's in government, and the hours are long and the bureaucracy is a maze and the politics are thick. But the slavers are still at work, and Lederer sees herself as a latter-day abolitionist.

"322","258 Killed in Border City","LA","The Justice Department here said today that 258 women had been killed since 1993 in Ciudad Juarez, the first time federal investigators offered a public death toll for a decade of killing in the border city. That tally appears to include what prosecutors say were the sexually motivated killings of at least 93 young women. Federal investigators have taken over the cases of 14 of the 93 sexual motivated murders and have suggested that organ trafficking or religious cults may have been involved.

"323","Rights Group Faults Police In Deaths of Women in Mexico","LA","The Mexican police have mishandled evidence, failed to question witnesses and otherwise botched investigations into a decade-long series of slayings of as many as 370 poor young women in the sprawling border city of Ciudad Juarez, Amnesty International said today in a report released here in the Mexican capital. In the 71-page report, the group documented what it called ""unjustifiable delays"" in investigations that could otherwise have led to arrests. The London-based group said the authorities in Ciudad Juarez, which borders El Paso, Tex., had bungled autopsies and resorted to falsifying evidence and torturing suspects to obtain confessions. The Amnesty report also said the families of the victims, all of them poor and with virtually no political influence, had been ignored and even maligned by the authorities. ""The failure of the competent authorities to take action to investigate these crimes, whether through indifference, lack of will, negligence or inability, has been blatant over the last 10 years,"" said the report, titled ""Intolerable Killings."" The report, released by Irene Khan, the secretary general of Amnesty, was based on a review of case files and interviews with victims' families, former investigators and advocates for victims of the killings. It was issued three weeks after the government of President Vicente Fox, in its first concrete steps after months of criticism, sent 300 federal police officers to Ciudad Juarez to bolster local police patrols. Amnesty International met with Mr. Fox today and urged his government to do more by closely supervising the investigations and taking over more of the cases. Federal prosecutors have already taken the lead on 14 cases because the crimes involve violations of federal law. The rights group also wants the government to review all the cases and impose harsh discipline on police officers and investigators who may have covered up crimes or mismanaged investigations. Amnesty estimated that 370 women had been slain, and at least 137 of them had been sexually assaulted. The attorney general's office in the state of Chihuahua has a smaller total, saying there are 300 cases of women missing and presumed dead. Amnesty reported that there had been 79 convictions of presumed killers. But the group says doubts have been cast on the criminal proceedings because of recurring reports involving the torture of suspects and the use of falsified evidence. ""There has been no change in the situation, the killers are still free,"" said Ms. Khan. ""Ten years down the road, no lessons have been learned."" Manuel Adolfo Esparza, coordinator of a special unit of state prosecutors investigating the slayings in Chihuahua, disputed Amnesty's characterization of the handling of the cases. He said suspects had not been tortured, nor had prosecutors mishandled evidence. The victims were in their teens or early 20's, young women who worked in the vast plants in Ciudad Juarez that assemble products for the export market. Many disappeared off the streets. Some were tortured and many were strangled, their remains left in the desert. In the last year, a growing number have also been killed in the city of Chihuahua, south of Ciudad Juarez. ""In short, young women with no power in society, whose deaths have no political cost for local authorities,"" the Amnesty report said, describing the victims. Norma Ledesma, mother of Paloma Angelica Escobar, 16, who was killed last year, said the authorities had been indifferent and evasive. That has prompted her and other mothers of missing young women to form a group that is now pressing officials to investigate the killings more actively. Their group has also mounted its own searches. ""All they have told us is lies, that is all,"" Ms. Ledesma said. ""For the authorities, we represent nothing.""",2003,"Mexico"

"328","Little Evidence of Serial Killings In Women's Deaths, Mexico Says","LA","During the past decade, hundreds of women have disappeared and turned up dead in the desert around Ciudad Juarez on the Rio Grande, but a federal report released Monday found little evidence that most were victims of gangsters or serial killers, as many women's groups contend. The report also found that local investigations into the killings, which prompted international outrage, have been slipshod, amateurish and half-hearted. It recommended legal action against 49 police officers and prosecutors for mishandling murder cases, in addition to 51 already under investigation. The 157-page report immediately drew fire from women's groups in Ciudad Juarez, who have long contended that drug-smuggling gangs and serial killers from rich families have murdered scores of women there and escaped prosecution because they operate with police complicity. Maricela Ortiz, director of Return Our Daughters Home, said the federal government should take over the investigations into the murders, rather than simply reviewing them and issuing what she deemed shallow reports. ''I think they already know who the killers are,'' she said. ''I believe they know what is happening, and this network of complicity will not permit an easy solution, because the people who kill are rich and powerful.'' But the committee that President Vicente Fox formed last January to get to the bottom of the murders has so far found a different pattern, according to the report it issued Monday, its second since its inception. So far, the committee has reviewed 155 murders of women during the past 10 years, about half of the 340 documented killings. It has found that about half of the killings it studied were prompted by motives ranging from domestic disputes to robbery and gang wars. A little more than a third -- 57 of the murders -- involved rape or appeared to be the work of someone with a morbid sexual obsession, according to the report. The document was presented by Maria Lopez Urbina, a prosecutor overseeing the federal inquiry into the murders. ''The majority of the homicides of women we studied are not the result of action by serial killers or the product of organized crime,'' the report said, though it acknowledged some of the killings had been linked to criminal gangs. Ms. Lopez Urbina's report excoriated the local police for lax investigations in which even the most basic forensic work, like searching for fibers on cadavers and establishing a time of death, was not carried out. In many cases, the police did not bother to record the names of the people who found the bodies and other potential witnesses, much less interview them. The committee found a complete ''absence of method'' in the investigations, the report said. Another federal official, Guadalupe Morfin, the special commissioner for the prevention of violence against women in Ciudad Juarez, said the state criminal justice system was plagued with ineptitude and mismanagement. The rampant murders of women in Ciudad Juarez, a city of 218,000 across the river from El Paso, Tex., and a busy drug-smuggling corridor, have puzzled American and Mexican criminologists. Experts agree the killings are not the work of a single psychopath but agree on little else. Some suspect that many of the killings may be linked to satanic cults, while others have speculated that the murderers are organ smugglers or producers of snuff movies. Others have theorized that the violence stems from social upheaval caused by rising drug abuse, police corruption and changing roles as women have migrated here to work on assembly lines, becoming the main breadwinners in a society once dominated by men.

"329","Mexican Police Dig Up 11 Bodies in Probe of Suspected Drug Boss","LA","Mexican police have discovered the bodies of 11 men buried beneath a middle-class home in the border city of Ciudad Juarez at a time of rising drug-related violence in Mexico. Police officers searched the house Friday as part of an investigation of a suspected drug cartel leader. They discovered four bodies buried in the yard over the weekend, then seven more on Monday. Police said some of the bodies were covered in lime, apparently to mask the smell of decomposition in the quiet neighborhood where the modest home was located. Police said they were still trying to determine a motive for the killings. Some of the bodies showed signs of torture, had tape over their mouths and were naked. At least one man had a plastic bag over his head. One official said the men had been suffocated, not shot, drug traffickers' usual method of execution, perhaps because these killings took place in a residential area. Drug-related executions have spiked this year along the border and in other parts of Mexico. In the state of Sinaloa alone this month, there have been more than 50  reported executions. In another border city, Nuevo Laredo, ""Los Zetas,"" a group of elite former soldiers who were trained to fight drug traffickers but have joined them, have been involved in several gun battles. Turf battles resulting from the capture of many high-ranking drug traffickers, and a large supply of marijuana and cocaine, are to blame for the spike in violence, federal anti-drug officials have said. Officers working on the Juarez case said they were led to the house where the bodies were discovered in the course of an investigation of Humberto Santillan Tabares, who was recently arrested just across the border in El Paso. Santillan is accused of being a principal figure in the violent drug cartel headed by Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, brother of the late Amado Carrillo Fuentes, Mexico's notorious ""Lord of the Skies,"" who died in 1997 after botched plastic surgery. Discovery of the bodies has caused an uproar in Juarez, a city that has gained international notoriety because of a decade-long string of unsolved rape-killings of young women. Many of the women's groups that have pleaded for a greater effort to solve the Juarez killings have said that the murders continue because of the atmosphere of impunity in a city infected by the drug trade and police corruption. ""It's horrible. It's frightening,"" said Esther Chavez Cano, director of Casa Amiga, a women's crisis center in Juarez. ""It's a sign of social deterioration and the lack of rule of law."" Chavez acknowledged officials' view that the victims entombed here were involved in the drug trade, but said the discovery also ""makes us think that some of the disappeared women might be buried in houses like this.""",2004,"Mexico"
"330","10 Are Charged With Smuggling Of Immigrants","LA","A group of girls and women from Honduras were kept in crowded apartments and forced to dance at bars and drink with male customers to pay back thousands of dollars to the people who smuggled them into the United States, the United States attorney for New Jersey charged on Thursday. At least 10 females, two as young as 14, were made to work as virtual slaves and were beaten and threatened with deportation if they tried to escape, according to a federal indictment filed on Thursday that charged eight women and two men with taking part in a smuggling ring reaching from Hudson County to Honduras. Some of the women and girls were raped while traveling here, according to the indictment. At least three who became pregnant were forced to take drugs that would cause an abortion, because the smugglers believed they would not be able to earn as much money if they were pregnant. ''This was inhumane and sadistic treatment of young women who were kept as virtual slaves,'' said Christopher J. Christie, the federal prosecutor. ''These are among the most vile crimes I have seen in my time as U.S. attorney.'' The 10 people, several of whom were related, were accused of bringing the women into the country and then forcing them to work up to seven nights a week at three bars in Union City and Guttenberg, to pay back debts as high as $20,000. One 21-year-old who was far along in a pregnancy was forced to take abortion-inducing drugs, and gave birth to a daughter the next day, but the baby died within hours, according to the indictment. A 14-year-old was beaten twice, once with a belt. Some of the defendants also threatened to hurt the workers' families back in Honduras if they did not pay back their smuggling debts, according to the indictment. Charges against the defendants included conspiracy to commit forced labor offenses, alien smuggling and harboring illegal aliens, Mr. Christie said. The offenses took place from May 2003 to January 2005. Prosecutors said recruiters for the ring worked in villages near Olanchito, Honduras, finding attractive women, mostly in their teens and early 20's, and promising them legitimate jobs as waitresses in the United States. The women left Honduras of their own volition, Mr. Christie said, and passed through Houston. ''They were kept in conditions where they were intimidated and controlled, and they were told not to trust law enforcement,'' said Deborah J. Gannett, an assistant United States attorney. The women and girls are in an undisclosed location, where they are receiving counseling, education and other social services, Mr. Christie said. They and 20 other women arrested in a January immigration raid at two apartments have been qualified for special visas that will allow them to stay in this country, become naturalized citizens and invite their families to join them as well, Mr. Christie said. According to the indictment, Luisa Medrano, 50, of Cliffside Park, was the ringleader; she owned and operated three bars and three apartments where the women lived. She is a naturalized United States citizen who is from El Salvador. John J. Fahy, who is representing Ms. Medrano, denied the charges in an interview. Also charged were seven Honduran natives, including three sisters: Noris Elvira Rosales Martinez, 29, and Ana Luz Rosales Martinez, 37, both of Union City and being held in the United States, and Nancy Rosales Martinez, 34, of Olanchito, who is in custody in Honduras; the mother of the three sisters, Zenia Zunilda Martinez, 56, and her sister, Lourdes Rosales Martinez, 33, both of Tejeras, who are in custody in Honduras; and Jose Arnaldo Isaula-Meza, 23, of Sonaguera, Honduras, and his sister, Elsa Consuelo Isaula-Meza, 44, of Houston, who are still being sought. Jose Magana, 40, of El Salvador and Union City, and Rosalba Ortiz, 34, of the Dominican Republic and Union City were charged and are in custody in the United States. Mr. Isaula-Meza was named the lead ''coyote.'' Prosecutors said he took the women to the United States-Mexican border and raped some of them, including a 14-year-old. If convicted, the defendants face fines of $250,000 and 5 to 20 years in prison. The indictment also seeks the forfeiture of Ms. Medrano's clubs and apartment buildings.

"331","Trouble in Paradise: Drug Runners and Battered Wives","LA","When battered wives show up at Lidia Cacho's crisis center, they often come with more than their children and their pain. They come with men like Alfredo Jimenez Potenciano trailing after them. Law enforcement officials consider Mr. Jimenez to be one of this city's most powerful drug traffickers, responsible along with his brothers for overseeing shipments of cocaine that pass through here on the way to the United States. On a bright morning last December he arrived in a caravan of sport utility vehicles at Ms. Cacho's refuge, carrying his AR-15 rifle. ''Give me back my wife and kid,'' he demanded, according to Ms. Cacho. ''If not, I'll jump over the fence and kill you all.'' Most of the local police officers were on strike. The others refused to respond. The federal police arrived an hour later. Mr. Jimenez and his companions got away, but not with his wife and child. This is the other Cancun. The city better known for its white sand, wet T-shirt contests and all-you-can-drink margaritas is also one of Mexico's most sinister cities. It is an essential hub of illegal traffic of all kinds, especially drugs, and of the violence that goes with it. In recent years increasing attention has been paid to the open clashes among organized mafias just a few miles from the Disneyesque tourist areas, although very limited progress has been made against them. Ms. Cacho, 42, fights the violence in their homes. Often she fights on her own. ''In almost all cases when women suffer violence by men, the women feel a deep sense of impotence against the omnipresence of the men,'' she said. ''In the case of the wives of drug traffickers, that feeling is much, much stronger. These husbands have dozens of men out looking for the women. And they will not stop until they find them, wherever they are. ''One woman told me that her husband said, 'Even if you crawl under a rock, I will find you.''' Ms. Cacho and other activists for women describe domestic violence as one of the ugliest byproducts of Mexico's culture of machismo. But most such violence, the experts lament, has been largely ignored by the police, lawmakers and the human rights community, except for the ruthless murders of women and girls in Ciudad Juarez. A study in 1993 by the National Women's Institute found that nearly half of the 19.4 million women surveyed said they had suffered some kind of domestic violence. In another study that same year, the Health Ministry reported that the state of Quintana Roo, whose largest city is Cancun, has the country's highest reported incidence of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Ms. Cacho said that last year more than 70 women were killed in incidents of domestic violence. Her center, she said, serves at least 300 women a month. And during spring break, Ms. Cacho said, at least 30 percent of those women are young American tourists. In 2002, according to a study done for the Mexican Congress, more than 2,700 women were killed by domestic violence across the country. More recent statistics are hard to find, the officials said, because state attorneys' offices and municipal police forces do not keep reports of every time their officers pull an enraged husband off his wife. In more cases than anyone likes to acknowledge, the victims endure their turmoil in silence, sometimes because they are too afraid to go to the police and sometimes because the police fail to answer their calls. Ms. Cacho, a native of Mexico City who was educated at the Sorbonne and speaks four languages, has been living with death threats for eight years. They started when she began writing newspaper columns against Mario Villanueva, the governor of Quintana Roo from 1993 to 1999; he is currently living in a maximum-security prison cell on charges related to drug trafficking. Since the release two weeks ago of her book about a child prostitution ring that operated with the complicity of the local police and politicians, the threats have become more frequent. In 1998, she was ambushed and raped in a bathroom in a bus station, an attack that Ms. Cacho believes was meant to silence her. It didn't. With a concussion and two broken ribs, she picked herself up from the floor and got herself to a hospital before breaking down briefly in a phone call to her mother. After the physical wounds healed, she decided to do more than write about the social problems that plagued Cancun. That is when the wives of drug traffickers and corrupt security agents began showing up at her door. And then came their husbands. Unlike most of the 35 other shelters for battered women across the country, Ms. Cacho's center is more like a witness protection program. In the three years since it opened, she says, she has helped win asylum in the United States and South America for at least several dozen wives who possess valuable evidence that could help authorities prosecute their husbands. ''Somehow the most difficult cases come to me,'' she said. Among her latest tough cases is that of an army lieutenant's wife who has fled to different shelters across the country trying to escape her husband. There also is the wife of a pilot for a major trafficker who is on the F.B.I.'s most wanted list. And there is a drug trafficker's wife who said her husband had links to the killing of nine traffickers and federal police agents here last December. Ms. Cacho said that in her first interviews with the trafficker's wife, the woman scanned newspaper photos of the massacre and identified some of the dead as her in-laws. It is a case that could leave her with another gun pointed in her face. ''I have a very clear perspective on this work,'' she said. ''We are living in a time when impunity permeates everything. We must either fight with everything we have, even our lives, or we have to leave this work. There's no middle ground. ''So when people ask me if I am willing to lose my life, I tell them I am not willing to lose my life. But I am willing to give it.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2005,"Mexico"
"332","Guatemala's Murdered Women","LA","For the last five years, Guatemala has suffered an epidemic of gruesome killings of women that are as mysterious as they are brutal. Typically a young woman in Guatemala City vanishes, and her body turns up a few days later in a garbage bag or in an open field. Many of the women's faces and bodies have been mutilated, and many have been tortured sexually or otherwise. Some of the bodies have messages, like ''death to bitches,'' scrawled on them. In Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a pattern of hundreds of killings of this type has drawn international condemnation. But aside from reports by Amnesty International and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Guatemalan women's deaths have gotten very little attention. At least a thousand women have been victims in the past five years, and only three killers are in prison. The police do not even investigate a vast majority of cases. Guatemala does not keep reliable statistics. But it is clear that a pattern of these killings was first seen in 2000, and the reported numbers have risen since then. Last year, there were 590 such killings of women, and the murders have grown more grisly. Many of the women were victims of gang warfare. Others were killed by husbands or boyfriends. But there are also cases of college students or shop workers who had no links to crime and simply disappeared -- until their bodies were found. What the women have in common is that their cases go nowhere. Overwhelmingly, victims' families report that the response of the authorities is a lack of interest. The police assure them that a missing daughter, for example, has run off with a boyfriend. When the body turns up, the crime is often dismissed with comments that the dead woman must have been a gang member or a prostitute, or killed by her partner -- as if these were justifications for failing to investigate. Guatemala has recently signed several international conventions protecting women, and it has established such new organizations as the office of the special prosecutor for crimes against women. But this progress is largely on paper. Laws are not enforced, and there is no money to finance the new offices. Guatemala is still a country where a rapist can escape charges by marrying the victim, and domestic violence cases can be prosecuted only if the victim can still show bruises 10 days later. Sexual harassment is not illegal. When such outdated attitudes toward women prevail, it is easy for the local authorities to justify taking no action when young women are murdered. Their inaction gives an official green light to the killers of women.",2005,"Guatemala"
"333","A Serial Killer Shakes Up a City and a Cultural Myth","LA","This much they know: Someone has been murdering older women in Mexico City, strangling them in their homes, pocketing a keepsake and vanishing into the city's streets. But investigators do not know whether the killer is a man or a woman, whether there is an accomplice or how the victims are chosen. After two years and at least 24 unsolved homicides, they have one fingerprint that matches partial prints from five other cases, a modus operandi and a police sketch of what appears to be a man made up as a woman. Investigators pieced together much of the killer's technique from evidence at the crime scenes. Then they got a break in July, when the son of a possible prospective victim dropped by his mother's house unexpectedly and caught a glimpse of someone fleeing. The person left behind a full fingerprint. To the residents of this capital and its unbounded suburbs, inured to street violence as they are, the presence of a serial killer is something alien. Such killers are seen as peculiarly American, a perversity born from a society many Mexicans believe long ago abandoned family ties, one that breeds hostile loners. Even the largely unsolved killings of more than 350 women over the past decade in Ciudad Juarez is seen as distant, a product of the city's closeness to the United States and the fractured families that migration to the United States has left behind. Mexico City's apparently homegrown serial killer rattles the cultural myth here that older people are protected within the cocoon of loving extended families. The truth is that increasing numbers of older Mexicans live alone in a city where families are dispersed. Bernardo Batiz, the attorney general for Mexico City, took a long time to admit that the city was dealing with a serial killer, although newspapers have been referring to the mataviejitas, or ''little old lady killer,'' for almost two years. ''It cost us more than a year for the authorities to take it seriously,'' said Pedro Borda, director of the National Institute for Elderly People. ''Now we know that the prosecutor feels the pressure.'' With the fingerprint offering evidence of a serial killer, the attorney general's office formed a task force and sought help from criminologists at the National Institute of Penal Sciences, who are creating a psychological profile of the killer. ''It's like looking for a needle in a haystack in a city so gigantic where anonymity is the rule, where people don't know each other,'' Mr. Batiz said. The criminologists are looking for shared traits among the victims and clues from the crime scenes, and are comparing the profile of the killings with other documented cases elsewhere. ''These are not casual victims, they are chosen victims,'' said Miguel Ontiveros, a criminologist at the institute. Investigators say they believe that they can attribute nine homicides during the past two years to one person and that the same person may be responsible for 15 more in the same period. Others say they believe that the killer may be responsible for more. Mr. Borda said there had been 66 murders of people older than 60 since 1998. They have been spread out all over the city, in middle-class and lower middle-class neighborhoods, in no evident pattern. Public pressure has grown during the past few months with the killing of Maria de los Angeles Repper, 92, in the modest central neighborhood of Escandon. She was strangled with her scarf in her ground-floor apartment in October after she went out to buy bread and milk. But this is a country with little experience in the kind of painstaking police work needed to catch a serial killer, experts say. ''The big problem is the scant data they have to work with,'' said Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a criminologist. Until recently, many prosecutions relied solely on a confession, often extracted under torture. Preserving a crime scene has only recently become standard procedure. ''It's just inexcusable that after fingerprints have been taken from a crime scene, they turn out to be the prints of police themselves,'' Mr. Ontiveros said. ''It happens all over Mexico.'' The following is what the investigators have concluded from their studies of the crime scenes, interviews with possible witnesses and the evidence from the July case: the killer is a broad-shouldered and heavily made-up person in women's clothing, suggesting a man trying to disguise himself; the killer works in the daytime, either approaching older women on the street and offering to help them carry bags home from the bakery or the supermarket, or by knocking on the door and claiming to be a nurse or a social worker; there has been no sign of forced entry in any case. Analyses of the crime scenes suggest that the killer usually stands behind the victim and then strangles her with an article of her own clothing. The body is left seated in a chair or on the bed. The killer then rifles through the house, taking something small, sometimes a religious statue. Strangely, three of the victims had a print of ''Boy in Red Waistcoat'' by the 18th-century French painter Jean-Baptiste Greuze hanging on the wall. ''We don't think it's a coincidence,'' Mr. Ontiveros said. ''Everything we find at the scene could be an indicator.'' The killer has left a trail across the city, and the police officers assigned to shopping centers, markets, bakeries and parks watch for anybody who fits the description. Early this month, investigators released a composite of a second person, a man, after there were reports of a possible accomplice in four of the killings. But without much more to go on, the authorities have focused on prevention. Some police officers give talks, advising older people on how to look out for themselves. Some 1.6 million fliers have been handed out, warning, ''Do not mention that you live or are alone at the moment.'' After the April killing of Ana Velazquez, 64, a neighborhood group invited elderly people to a meeting to give them advice on how to protect themselves, recalled Catalina Butron, 80, a resident of the same central leafy neighborhood of Condesa. ''I'm not really scared,'' she said. ''But I am very careful.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2005,"Mexico"
"334","Woman Held As Serial Killer In Mexico City","LA","A woman who sold popcorn and worked as a professional wrestler was arrested here Wednesday on charges that she murdered at least 10 elderly women over the last two years, the authorities said. The suspect, Juana Barraza, 48, was arrested after a tenant saw her running from the house of an 82-year-old woman just found strangled with a stethoscope in a working-class neighborhood in the center of Mexico City, prosecutors said. Investigators then matched the fingerprints of Ms. Barraza to those left at the scenes of other killings, the police said. Joel Ortega Cuevas, the chief of Mexico City's police force, was quoted by El Universal newspaper as saying Ms. Barraza had coolly confessed to being what had become known as the ''Little Old Lady Killer.'' For years, investigators have been tracking a killer they believed was a man disguised as a woman responsible for possibly dozens of daytime deaths. The killer always followed the same pattern, getting into the homes of elderly women who lived alone either after offering to carry in groceries or knocking on the door and pretending to be a social worker. Analyses of the crime scenes suggested that the killer strangled the victims from behind with articles of their own clothing or other effects from their homes. The bodies were left on a chair or bed. The killer then often rifled the house and stole something small, often a religious statue. The city police, who are not known for their investigative prowess, caught a break in July when the killer left a full fingerprint at the house of a woman whom the police believed was a prospective victim. The son of the woman had dropped in and spotted someone fleeing. That print was matched to partial prints from five other slayings. The police now say that it belongs to Ms. Barraza and that they have other evidence linking her to at least 10 killings and one attempted murder. The killings had shaken the cultural myth here that older people are protected by loving extended families and exposed the fact that more and more older Mexicans live alone in a city where families are dispersed. It also aroused terror among the city's older residents. The terror seems to have ended Wednesday after a student lodger returned home and saw Ms. Barraza rushing out of her house. The lodger went into the living room and found her landlady, Ana Maria Reyes, 82, lying dead. She had been strangled with a stethoscope. The student called the police, who caught Ms. Barraza a few blocks away. Hector Ramos, a spokesman for the attorney general's office in Mexico City, said Ms. Barraza had admitted to investigators that she had killed several elderly women but said she did not remember how many. She described killing them with scarves, stockings and in one case a telephone cord, he said. She did not know her victims. ''She said she did it out of anger at them,'' he said. Ms. Barraza lives in a suburb of Mexico City, Ixtapaluca, and works as a popcorn vendor at professional wrestling matches, a popular pastime here. She also had been a wrestler in the past and has a heavy, strong build, the police said.",2006,"Mexico"
"335","Human-Smuggling Inquiry Leads to Raids and Arrests","LA","Federal agents on Monday broke up what they said was a human-smuggling ring based in New Jersey that investigators believe may have forced immigrant women to work as prostitutes. Investigators with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Newark arrested two brothers and detained more than 60 others on Monday morning after raiding 15 sites, including places in West New York, Union City and elsewhere in Hudson County. Officials said that they were also caring for a dozen children who were found during the raids. Investigators said they were the children of the women who were taken into custody. Immigration officials said they were still trying to gauge the scope of the ring's operations, which almost exclusively involved Mexican immigrants, and determine if the women had been forced into prostitution. ''We know it's an illegal smuggling operation,'' said Kyle Hutchins, special agent in charge of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Newark. ''We do not know who smuggled these people. We don't even know if they were forced into prostitution. They might have been prostitutes in Mexico who came up here to make more money.'' Two brothers, Jose Luis Notario, 50, and Ignacio Notario, 46, were arrested in Union on Monday on charges related to illegally transmitting money. Jose Luis Notario, who was born in Mexico and is a legal permanent resident of the United States, was also charged with harboring illegal immigrants. His brother, who was living in the country illegally, faces a deportation order, Mr. Hutchins said. Officials say they believe that the Notarios traveled frequently to ferry money between the United States and Mexico. In addition, a criminal complaint filed against the brothers accused Ignacio Notario of illegally transporting ''medicine used in the prostitution business, including antibiotics, abortion-inducing drugs and condoms'' that they said he had obtained from drug stores in Mexico and then smuggled into the United States. The complaint accused Ignacio Notario of selling some of the items at his convenience store, Su Tienda Mexicana, in West New York. Both men made their initial appearance in federal court in Newark on Monday. The investigation into the ring began about 18 months ago when federal agents working in San Diego obtained the address of what the complaint called a safe house in New Jersey, which was raided on Monday, Mr. Hutchins said. The ring appears to be related to a smuggling operation that originated in San Miguel Tenancingo, in the Mexican state of Tlaxcala, from which women are taken to the United States to work as prostitutes, the complaint said. ''Once the females are smuggled into the United States, a large percentage are transported to the East Coast, where they are put to work as prostitutes, some against their will,'' the complaint read. The women were taken to houses in northern New Jersey and in Jackson Heights, Queens, from which they were sent to work weeklong shifts in brothels in Maryland and Virginia, according to the complaint. It was unclear Monday night if the house in Queens was raided. At the end of the women's shifts, the complaint said, they were brought ''back to the 'safe houses' where they live with their traffickers.'' It was during one of those return trips, on Sunday night, Mr. Hutchins said, that the authorities made their first break in the case. The state police pulled over a car and a van and detained 10 women and 2 drivers who were returning from Maryland. On Monday morning, agents raided various ''safe houses'' in northern New Jersey and detained 26 women and 28 men. Charges were pending against them. Mr. Hutchins said that it might take several weeks for the authorities to put together a comprehensive portrait of the ring, but he said more arrests were expected.",2006,"Mexico"

"337","Rape of Girl, 15, Exposes Abuses in Brazil Prison System","LA","The police jail at Abaetetuba could not be torn down soon enough for Marcia Soares, a lawyer and federal human rights official here. To her, the jail has come to symbolize everything that is wrong with Brazil's efforts to safeguard women and children from violence. It was at Abaetetuba, in the northeastern state of Para on the fringes of the Amazon, that a 15-year-old girl arrested on suspicion of petty theft was illegally placed among 34 male inmates in late October. For 26 days they treated her as their plaything, raping and torturing her repeatedly. Sometimes she traded sex for food; other times, she was simply raped, federal investigators here said. The police in the jail did more than turn their backs on the violence. They shaved her head with a knife to make her look more like a boy, investigators said, and now are blaming her for lying about her age. The case is causing soul-searching here in Brazil's capital, where federal officials have become increasingly concerned about the treatment of women and minors in the nation's crowded prison system  and the failure of judges throughout the country to prosecute cases of torture. Women make up only 5 percent of Brazil's prison population, but the number is growing. States have not built enough jails and prisons with separate facilities for women, even though federal law requires such separation. A recent study commissioned by the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva showed that female prisoners were being illegally placed with men or transvestites in five Brazilian states, and being subjected to torture and sexual abuse. Even as Brazil was raised in November to the United Nations' highest human development  category, its spotty human rights history and mixed record of punishing those guilty of abuses have been an Achilles' heel internationally. A SWAT team operates in Rio de Janeiro to root out and kill drug traffickers with impunity. The police are rarely convicted under a 1997 law against torture, because of an ''institutionalizing of torture'' under Brazil's military dictatorship and more than 300 years of slavery, said Paulo Vanucchi, Brazil's human rights minister. The case of the 15-year-old will be another test of justice in the largely lawless Amazon region. Two years ago, a Brazilian rancher ordered the killing of Dorothy Mae Stang, 73, an American-born nun and rain forest advocate. She was shot to death on a jungle road. The rancher, Vitalmiro Bastos de Moura, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. What has been particularly disheartening to federal human rights officials in the case of the 15-year-old girl is how many people had the chance to protect her. Ms. Soares, the lawyer, said the police, the judge and a public defender who had visited the jail all knew the teenager was in an all-male setting. ''Several officials were aware of what was happening, and at worst they were complicit in it,'' Ms. Soares said. ''It's a very serious situation.'' Ana Julia Carepa, the governor of Para, has been scrambling to clean up the mess since the situation became public late last month. Ms. Carepa pressed Raimundo Benassuly, the state police chief, to resign the day after he said publicly that the girl had lied about her age because she had a ''mental deficiency.'' The police have said that the girl had claimed she was 19, not 15, during several run-ins with the law. Ms. Soares said that officials, including the judge in the case, a woman, did not press the girl for documentation proving she was an adult, even though she is under five feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds. ''When I first saw her I thought she was 12, not 15,'' Ms. Soares said. For Ms. Carepa, the girl's age is beside the point. ''If she is 15, 20, 50, 80 years old or almost 100, it doesn't matter,'' she told journalists in Rio last month. ''A woman cannot be in a cell with men.'' Ms. Carepa  said  that the jail would  be torn down and replaced with something that has facilities for women. The judge who placed the girl in the all-male jail, Clarice Maria Andrade, is being investigated and could lose her job. Two others in her office are accused of altering a document to make it seem as if the judge had approved a transfer from  the jail shortly after the police made the request, not 12 days later. Local officials were already familiar with the girl before she was arrested and placed in the Abaetetuba jail on Oct. 21. Growing up in a broken home, she had left school before and frequented an area known for child prostitution, Ms. Soares said. At the time of her arrest, she was shuttling among her parents' homes and an uncle's house, and no one seemed to keep careful tabs on her. During the 26 days, no relative came to the jail looking for her. Within her first two days in jail, a man raped her in the bathroom, the girl told investigators. Inmates rely on visiting relatives to bring food. With no such visits, extreme hunger soon overtook the girl and she began trading sex for food, investigators said. Other men, however, simply raped her when they wanted to, and tortured her for amusement, investigators said. Some placed crumpled papers between her toes as she slept and lighted them, Ms. Soares said, adding that the girl still had burn marks on her feet. Residents heard the girl's screams from the road, which is near the jail windows. Yet for weeks no one came to her rescue. It was only after an anonymous note reached the local child protection services agency that she was removed from the jail. In recent days, she and her family have been relocated under a federal witness protection program. The girl's father complained of death threats from the police. He said they had tried to press him to say that the girl was 19 or 20. ''It's now up to us to protect her and help her to start a new life,'' Ms. Soares said. ''And we need to keep up the political pressure, so that justice has a chance.''",2007,"Brazil"
"338","Abuse Trails Central American Girls Into Gangs","LA","To join one of Central America's fierce street gangs, Benky, a tiny young woman with heavy mascara and tattoos running up and down her arms, had to have sex with a dozen or so of her homeboys one night. She recalls sobbing uncontrollably when the last young man climbed off her and everyone gathered around to congratulate her on becoming a full-fledged member of the Mara Salvatrucha. The gang leader ordered Benky, then 14, to rob buses, grab chains off people's necks and even kill a girl from a rival gang. She always complied, although Benky said she was not completely sure if her rival had lived or died from the bullet she fired into her back. ''I thought it would be like my family,'' Benky said of her reason for joining the gang, asking that her full name not be used. ''I thought I'd get the love I was missing. But they'd hit me. They ordered me around. They told me I had to rob someone or kill someone, and I did it.'' When she tried to leave the gang five years later, her fellow gang members shot her six times. The scars still visible on her body vouch for her story, as do social workers who visited her during the nine months she spent in a hospital. Horrible as it is, Benky's story is not unusual. Her lament is one heard from young women in gangs across the region, and in interviews many told similar tales of sexual initiation, beatings and being made to rob and kill to earn their place. New evidence suggests that girls like Benky, most 18 or younger, may make up a larger share of Central America's street gangs' ranks than previously suspected, many of them straddling the line between victims and victimizers. ''There are a lot more women and girls than anyone imagined,'' said Ewa Werner-Dahlin, the Swedish ambassador to Guatemala. ''It's a surprise to the experts and it shows that authorities have been reacting to gangs without really understanding them.'' Her government recently helped finance a study that included interviews with more than 1,000 past and present gang members, male and female, across Central America. It found that women might account for as much as 40 percent of the region's gang membership. Other gang experts put the percentage lower. The street gangs of Central America, which have spun a web of violence through Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and even the United States, are estimated to have as many as 100,000 members. Among them are only a small number of girl-only gangs led by girls, experts say. Far more common was Benky's reality -- a few young women in a sea of tough, sexually charged young men. It is abuse in their home lives that often propels them into the gangs in the first place, and those gangs often continue the abuse under the veil of protection. The gang is their adopted family, the women say, offering what proves to be an unpredictable mix of affection and aggression. ''If a girl is getting abused by her father, the gang will step in and end it,'' said Gustavo Cifuentes, a streetwise former gang member with an extensive criminal record who now works for Guatemala's government trying to lure gang members into leading better, law-abiding lives. If the girls do not follow the directions of the leader, Mr. Cifuentes acknowledged, a beating or even worse will be the result. Male gang members say the girls play an essential role and not just as sexual partners. They are able to move more freely on the streets when the police are around, transporting drugs or guns. And bus robberies are best done, veteran gangsters say, with a team of two males and two females, confusing passengers about who is involved. With four jail stints behind her, Benky, now 23, is  experiencing a new phase of life, but one that is proving almost as rough as all she has endured before. Her wounds have left her limping through life, selling candy on the buses she used to rob because her gang tattoos disqualify her from most other forms of employment. Most of those who made up her gang have died in shootouts with the police, she said, but one of the few still living spotted her recently on the street and yelled out a threat on her life. He had been surprised that she had survived the attempt to kill her. ''It looks so good from the outside,'' Benky said about why she had joined the gang. To understand her sentiment, it helps to know that her childhood, like those of many other girls in gangs, was grim. She began living on the streets at the age of 6 with an older brother. She is not sure what happened to her mother, but she recalls that her father had no interest in taking care of them. Her brother was shot by a member of the 18th Street gang, which prompted her to join the other giant gang in the region, the Mara Salvatrucha, she said, looking for love and acceptance. Benky had begun hanging around the gang and knew a few other girls who had joined. They told her that all she had to do was talk to the leader and he would induct her as well. Before she knew what was happening, though, her new family members were disrobing and lining up to have sex with her. The abuse ebbed when she began dating a gang member and he protected her from the rest. ''He was very kind,'' she said. ''Sometimes, he'd go out and rob buses just to get me what I wanted.'' Other girls in gangs, who also insisted on being identified only by their first names or nicknames, also complained of lives ruined, close calls with death, and nightmares about all the awful things they did for their gangs and neighborhoods. It often begins, the girls say, with group sex, their minds usually dulled with alcohol and marijuana. Ana, 21, who spent four years as a member of the 18th Street gang, said she was given a choice between group sex and a group beating when she joined because she was friends with the gang leader's girlfriend. ''Other girls didn't get to choose,'' she said. ''I thought the beating was better. I'd have a black eye and I'd be hurt but at least I wouldn't get pregnant or get a disease.'' Her gang days were intense ones, she recalls, full of assaults and robberies and other behavior she now regards as deviant. ''I learned to use a gun more or less but I was better with a knife,'' she said. Her gang had a separate leader for the girls, and that tough young woman one day ordered Ana to beat up a neighborhood girl whom the leader found annoying. The girl happened to be a friend of Ana, but Ana said she did what she had to do. Another former gang member, a 17-year-old called Moncha, broke down as she described how someone in her gang had shot her friend to death. ''I lost my best friend, and my own gang killed her,'' she said. ''That's when I realized that if they killed her, they could kill me, too. I got tired of living this life where they might say, 'Let's go kill someone,' and you had to go along.'' Ana had a somewhat easier time than others did putting her gang life behind her. Her mother was dying from cancer, and that prompted her to move back home and care for her around the clock. Her mother's long illness allowed Ana to make a break. Her path was a little easier than Benky's because she never got any tattoos to identify herself as a gang member. Eschewing tattoos is becoming more and more common as Central American governments crack down on gangs with ''mano dura,'' or firm hand, policies, gang experts say. At Santa Teresa prison, a sprawling detention center for women in Guatemala City, signs of both hope and despair can be found. Bianca, 24, a tough member of the 18th Street gang who is locked up on drug charges, showed off her bold gang tattoos and spoke of protecting her neighborhood. She stood on the sideline during the jailyard soccer game put on by Guatemala's Ministry of Culture and Sports. But another inmate, 25, who goes by the nickname Happy, said she intended to leave the gang when she finished her sentence for robbing buses. In her first years behind bars, members of the gang would come by to visit, she said. But that eventually faded. Nowadays, five years in, it is only her mother who brings her food and clothes. ''She's family,'' Happy said. ''It took years but I finally learned that.''",2008,"Guatemala"

"340","As Mexican Killings Rise, Groups Take Envoy to Task","LA","Lawless Ciudad Juarez has become a potent symbol of Mexico's escalating drug war. Drug cartels recently chased out the police chief there, and citizens have become fearful witnesses to daily murders of drug dealers, police officers and bystanders. But lost amid the headlines are the murders of young women  that drew international notice more than a decade ago and that continue today. Now, frustrated women's groups are making new headlines of their own, challenging the recent appointment of Mexico's ambassador to Canada, Francisco Barrio Terrazas. They say he was negligent in dealing with the killings in the 1990s as governor of the state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juarez is located, across the border from El Paso, Tex. The women's groups, along with other human rights organizations, sent a formal protest to Mexico's Ministry of Foreign Relations this month. They are also asking the Foreign Relations Commission of the Mexican Senate to reconsider Mr. Barrio Terrazas' appointment. Several human rights groups in Quebec have supported their protests. ''He doesn't represent Mexicans,'' said Marisela Ortiz, a founder of May Our Daughters Return Home, an association of victims' families in Ciudad Juarez that is leading the challenge. ''Because of his misogynistic characteristics, we oppose him having any position, and even less in a country that is known as a promoter of peace.'' Rights groups estimate that as many as 500 women have been killed since 1993 in Ciudad Juarez and other cities in the state of Chihuahua. Many of them were tortured before they were killed, their bodies often found weeks later, dumped in the desert. Many of the killings remain unsolved. Although several people have been convicted in some of the slayings over the years, some were later released after evidence suggested they were tortured into confessing. Women's groups have long maintained that the police did not try to solve the cases, either because they feared that organized crime was involved or because they were involved themselves, or both. The groups also argue that the authorities simply did not care because the victims were poor. Many of those killed had challenged Mexico's machismo culture by earning their own livings in the area's assembly plants. The women's groups' most incendiary assertion against Mr. Barrio Terrazas -- and one that the Mexican media have repeated -- is that he once suggested that the victims should not have worn miniskirts and walked through unlighted streets. But it is unclear whether Mr. Barrio Terrazas, who was governor for six years starting in 1992, ever made such a statement. In response to a query, the Mexican Embassy in Ottawa said the ambassador ''rejects the notion that he was indifferent or insensitive about the topic or that he insinuated that the murdered women of Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, bore some responsibility for their own deaths.'' The embassy statement also said he had ''strongly encouraged the punishment of the perpetrators of murders or disappearances of women.'' Mr. Barrio Terrazas, a member of President Felipe Calderon's National Action Party, has held several national posts since his years as governor, including serving as a deputy in the Mexican Congress. He began work as ambassador on Feb. 26, after Senate ratification. As violence in Juarez has risen in the past year, so, too, have the killings of women, said Ms. Ortiz, of May Our Daughters Return Home. The state government said that 98 women were killed last year in Juarez, although Ms. Ortiz estimated the toll at 130. Although attention in Mexico to the plight of the women of Juarez has wavered, the murders have caught the attention of celebrities. The latest to take up the cause is the singer Peter Gabriel who, along with representatives of human rights groups, met with Mr. Calderon last month  to deliver a petition asking him to work to end violence against women.",2009,"Mexico"

"343","El Salvador Investigates Adviser To Detained Americans in Haiti","LA","The police in El Salvador have begun an investigation into whether a man suspected of leading a trafficking ring involving Central American and Caribbean women and girls is also a legal adviser to many of the Americans charged with trying to take 33 children out of Haiti without permission. When the judge presiding over the Haitian case learned on Thursday of the investigation in El Salvador, he said he would begin his own inquiry of the adviser, a Dominican man who was in the judge's chambers  days before. The inquiries are the latest twist in a politically charged case that is unfolding in the middle of an earthquake disaster zone. A lawyer for the group has already been dismissed after being accused of trying to offer bribes to get the 10 Americans out of jail. The adviser, Jorge Puello, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he had not engaged in any illegal activity in El Salvador and that he had never been in the country. He called it a case of mistaken identity. ''I don't have anything to do with El Salvador,'' he said, suggesting that his name was as common in Latin America as John Smith is in the United States. ''There's a Colombian drug dealer who was arrested with 25 IDs, and one of them had my name,'' he said, not elaborating. ''Bring the proof,'' he said when pressed about the child-trafficking accusations in the brief interview, which ended when he said he was entering an elevator. Reached later, he became angry and said he had broken no laws. The 10 Americans have been imprisoned since Jan. 29 in the back of the same police station used by President Rene Preval as the seat of Haiti's government since the earthquake. They had been told by their lawyers that at least some of them would be on their way home on Thursday. But the judge overseeing their case, Bernard Saint-Vil, recommended to the prosecutor that they be tentatively released from custody and permitted to leave the country as long as a representative stayed behind until the case was completed. Mr. Puello has been acting as a spokesman and legal adviser for most of the detainees in the Dominican Republic. The family of one of the detained Americans obtained independent counsel as of Feb 7. The head of the Salvadoran border police, Commissioner Jorge Callejas, said in a telephone interview that he was investigating accusations that a man with a Dominican passport that identified him as Jorge Anibal Torres Puello led a human trafficking ring that recruited Dominican women and under-age Nicaraguan girls by offering them jobs and then putting them to work as prostitutes in El Salvador. Mr. Puello said he did not even have a passport. When Mr. Callejas was shown a photograph taken in Haiti of Mr. Puello, Mr. Callejas said he thought it showed the man he was seeking. He said he would try to arrest Mr. Puello on suspicion of luring women into prostitution and taking explicit photographs of them that were then posted on  Internet sites. ''It's him, the same beard and face,'' Mr. Callejas said in an interview on Thursday. ''It has to be him.'' Judge Saint-Vil also said he thought that the photo of the trafficking suspect in a Salvadoran police file appeared to be the same man he had met in court. He said he intended to begin his own investigation into whether a trafficking suspect had been working with the Americans detained in Haiti. ''I was skeptical of him because he arrived with four bodyguards, and I have never seen that from a lawyer,'' the judge said in an interview. ''I plan to get to the bottom of this right away.'' The judge said he would request assistance from the Department of Homeland Security to look into Mr. Puello's background. A spokesman for the department said American officials were playing a supporting role in the investigation surrounding the Americans, providing ''investigative support as requested.'' An Interpol arrest warrant has been issued for someone named Jorge Anibal Torres Puello, according to the police and public documents. There were questions about whether Mr. Puello, the adviser, who said the Central Valley Baptist Church in Idaho had hired him to represent the Americans, was licensed to practice law. Records at the College of Lawyers in the Dominican Republic listed no one with his name. Mr. Puello said he had a law license and was part of a 45-member law firm. But his office in Santo Domingo turned out to be a humble place, which could not possibly fit 45 lawyers. Mr. Puello's brother Alejandro said that the firm had another office in the central business district, but he declined to provide an address. Mr. Puello said in the interview that he had been representing the Americans free of charge because he was a religious man who commiserated with their situation. ''I'm president of the Sephardic Jewish community in the Dominican Republic,'' he said. ''I help people in this kind of situation. We're not going to charge these people a dime.'' But other lawyers for the detainees said that the families had wired Mr. Puello $12,000 to pay for the Americans' transportation out of Haiti if they were released, and that they had been told by Mr. Puello in a conference call late Tuesday that he needed an additional $36,000. Mr. Puello said that he had not participated in a conference call. One lawyer for the families said that Mr. Puello had told him that he was licensed to practice law in Florida, but the lawyer said he had checked and found no such record. Mr. Puello said in the interview that he had never said he was licensed in Florida. Mr. Puello said that he had been born in Yonkers, N.Y., and that his mother was Dominican. He said that his full name was Jorge Puello and that he had no other names. But then in a subsequent interview he said his name was Jorge Aaron Bentath Puello. He said he was born in October 1976, and not in October 1977, which the police report indicates is the birth date of the suspect in the Salvadoran case. The report said the police had found documents connected to the Sephardic Jewish community in a house in San Salvador where the traffickers had held women.",2010,"Haiti"
"344","Trafficking Charges for Adviser to Jailed Americans in Haiti","LA","As the 10 Americans imprisoned in Haiti for trying to remove children from the country awaited a decision on their fate Monday, the legal woes of the man who falsely portrayed himself as the group's lawyer mounted. The one-time legal adviser, who calls himself Jorge Puello, now acknowledges that he faces sex trafficking charges in El Salvador under the name Jorge Anibal Torres Puello. He remained at large on Monday, as Dominican, Salvadoran and American law enforcement officials worked with Interpol to interview his relatives and search border and immigration records to find him. Mr. Puello is wanted by the police in at least four countries in connection with charges including sex trafficking of girls and women, and making counterfeit documents and violating parole. The Salvadoran police unveiled a sex trafficking ring last May in which they said Mr. Puello was helping to bring women and girls from Central America and the Caribbean into El Salvador and luring them into prostitution through offers of modeling and office jobs. Nude and semi-nude photographs were taken of women and girls and put on Internet sites, the police said. The case against Mr. Puello broke open when three under-age Nicaraguan girls escaped from a house where they said they had been held captive for up to ten days by Mr. Puello's wife, Ana Josefa Galvarina Ramirez Orellana, and another man, according to Jorge Callejas, head of the Salvadoran border police. The girls had been recruited in Nicaragua by a Nicaraguan man who offered them jobs. Upon arriving in El Salvador, they complained that they were photographed and not allowed to leave the house. When the police raided the house, they found two other girls from the Dominican Republic. The police arrested the Nicarguan man and Mr. Puello's wife, who is believed to have managed logistics and fed the girls. Mr. Puello, who was tied to the scene by documents at the house, got away, the police said. There were suggestions that the ring may have had the protection of government officials. A car parked out front at the time of the raid was registered to Pablo Nasser, who was deputy director of immigration at the time, Mr. Callejas said. The police also found a letter sent by Mr. Nasser to Dominican immigration authorities requesting approval for two Dominican women to travel to El Salvador for company training. Those two women are believed to be victims in the sex ring, Mr. Callejas said. Mr. Nasser, who has denied involvement in the ring, told local press that he had sold the car to Ms. Galvarina months before the raid. No charges have been filed against him. Carlos Velasquez, who was the head of the prosecutor's office on human trafficking at the time of the raid, told local press that he suspected the letter signed by Mr. Nasser was falsified and closed the case on Mr. Nasser. Mr. Velasquez has since been removed from his post, said Luis Ever, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. Mr. Puello, whom Salvadoran police believe fled the country, was a fugitive when he enmeshed himself late last month in the case of the 10 church members from the United States. Two days after they were arrested on Jan. 29 while attempting to take 33 children across the border from Haiti into the Dominican Republic, Mr. Puello called up an Idaho church where five of the 10 Americans attend, offering pro bono legal services. Two relatives called him back and accepted, and Mr. Puello then began acting as the group's lawyer, even though he lacked a law degree. Since his background has emerged, some of the detainees have sought to distance themselves from the man. ''My clients have never met Mr. Puello and know nothing about him,'' said Caleb Stegall, the district attorney of Jefferson County, Kansas, who is representing Drew Culberth, Paul Thompson, Silas Thompson and Steve McMullin. ''As far as my clients are concerned, Mr. Puello never spoke on their behalf and as far as I am concerned, Mr. Puello has no involvement in this case now on behalf of my clients.'' Hiram Sasser, who is representing Jim Allen, said his client never authorized Mr. Puello to represent him, either. When first confronted by The Times about the sex trafficking charge on Thursday, Mr. Puello said he had never stepped foot in El Salvador, portraying the issue as a case of mistaken identity. Later, his version changed and he acknowledged in a telephone interview with CNN that he was the man charged in El Salvador, but said he was innocent. He said he spent 18 months in a Canadian jail pending an unsuccessful extradition request by United States authorities. He also said he had served jail time in the United States for handling money related to a drug-trafficking operation, and he was jailed again briefly for violating parole. He denied the drug charge. Dave Oney, spokesman United States Marshal Service said Monday that several marshals visited Mr. Puello's parents' house in Santo Domingo on Monday to question them about his whereabouts. Mr. Oney said that there were multiple warrants for Mr. Puello's arrest. On Monday, Bernard Saint-Vil, the Haitian judge who is handling the case of the detained Americans, said he intended to further question Laura Silsby, the group's leader, about any connection she might have with Mr. Puello. A decision on release appeared days away. The judge on Monday afternoon was awaiting a written response from the prosecutor, Jean Serge Joseph, who said that because of a power outage at his office he was unable to print the full decision for the judge. Mr. Saint-Vil said he will not be working on Tuesday because of Mardi Gras, making Wednesday the earliest day for a ruling on the Americans' release. ''The final decision is mine and when I get all the documents I'll decide,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''The judge has the last word.''",2010,"Haiti"
"345","Many States In Mexico Crack Down On Abortion","LA","GUANAJUATO, Mexico -- The woman came into the hospital, bleeding, scared and barely out of her teens. But before anyone would treat her, the authorities had to be called. Doctors believed that she had had an illegal abortion, so first, a man from the prosecutor's office had to arrive and ask her about her sexual history. Then, after she was treated but still groggy from the anesthesia, another investigator showed up and took her statement. The investigation is still open two months later. Prosecutors are seeking medical records to determine whether they will charge the young woman, who asked that her name not be used, as well as the person they suspect helped her. Here in the state of Guanajuato, where Roman Catholic conservatives have controlled government for more than 15 years, it is standard procedure to investigate suspected cases of abortion. But Guanajuato is no anomaly, women's rights advocates and some health officials say, since a broad move to enforce antiabortion laws has gained momentum in other parts of Mexico. One reason is a backlash against Mexico City's decision three years ago to permit legal abortion to any woman in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After the Supreme Court upheld that law in 2008, 17 states passed constitutional amendments declaring that life begins at conception, even though abortion was already illegal everywhere but Mexico City, except in cases of rape or to save a mother's life. ''It is a political response,'' said Pedro Salazar, a legal scholar at the Institute of Legal Research of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. ''This is a well-coordinated initiative. It's not a spontaneous decision.'' Lawyers contend that rather than tightening existing antiabortion legislation, the state amendments are aimed at preventing future state governments from possibly following Mexico City's lead and legalizing abortion. There is also opposition in some quarters to emergency contraception. About 300 doctors working for public hospitals in Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city, and the state of Jalisco sought protection from the Supreme Court last year against a federal policy allowing patients to get the morning-after pill. The court has yet to decide the case. The enforcement of the antiabortion law here in Guanajuato has created what critics call a climate in which any pregnancy that does not end with a healthy baby raises suspicions about the mother. The fear of being investigated means that even some women who want to be pregnant but have complications or lose the baby ''have to think twice about going to a hospital,'' said Nadine Goodman, who runs a school for midwives in the Guanajuato town of San Miguel de Allende. Dr. Luis Alberto Villanueva, adjunct director of maternal health for Mexico's Health Ministry, said he was concerned that antiabortion enforcement could scare many women around the country away from seeking health care. ''The intentional search for 'proof' in women with bleeding in the first half of pregnancy diverts health workers from their task,'' he said, ''and drives women away from medical facilities, even at the risk of placing them in conditions of high risk to their health or their life.'' He added that poor women, who rely most on public hospitals, were particularly vulnerable. State prosecutors here in Guanajuato have opened 166 investigations for abortion in 10 years, according to women's health advocates. Most of them do not reach a judge, but nine women have been convicted for having abortions. They were sentenced to jail, but paid a bond to finish their sentences on parole. In states where antiabortion laws are strictly enforced, there can also be a fine line between charging a woman with abortion and sentencing her for killing a newborn. In the gulf state of Veracruz, the state women's institute found this year that eight women serving sentences for homicide -- killing their babies after they had been born alive -- had either had abortions, which has a much lighter penalty, or had miscarriages or stillbirths. They have since been released, according to the institute's departing director. Eight women in Guanajuato have also been jailed on homicide charges in recent years, stirring a debate over whether the authorities have used the crime as a way to pursue tougher sentences against women who had had abortions, or perhaps simply lost a baby during pregnancy. When the cases were publicized last month after one woman was released on appeal, the national news media descended on Guanajuato and the women gave jailhouse interviews. Some contended that they had been forced to sign confessions after they gave birth to babies who were stillborn or premature. Their lawyers argued the medical evidence in their cases was too shoddy to determine whether the babies had actually been born alive. ''The women went into labor alone,'' said Javier Cruz Angulo, a lawyer who runs the legal clinic at CIDE, a Mexico City university, which won the first appeal. ''There were no health services.'' The cases created such a furor that the State Congress changed the women's sentences and applied them retroactively. This month, the women, who had been serving terms of 25 to 30 years, were freed but not absolved. Yolanda Martinez, 25, who had been in jail for almost seven years, walked out with her fist raised. ''This state is too tough,'' she said as she emerged. ''They accuse you of crimes that you never committed.'' Other complex cases have come to light. Earlier this year, an 11-year-old girl in the state of Quintana Roo was found to be pregnant after she was raped by her stepfather. Because the girl was ashamed to tell her mother, her pregnancy was discovered at four months -- too late, under a recently tightened state law, to give her the option of an abortion. The case fueled a debate over the unintended consequences of tightening abortion laws. The federal government is opposed to legalizing abortion, and Guanajuato has long been one of the most reliable strongholds of President Felipe Calderon's National Action Party. Still, the situation here has raised alarm among some health officials like Dr. Villanueva. Concerned that other states are following Guanajuato's lead, he sent a letter to state health secretaries objecting to viewing women with health problems as potential suspects and warning against ''trying to use health workers in this process.'' But state health officials in Guanajuato say that they are required to uphold the law and notify authorities in cases of suspected abortions. The situation is no different, they say, from calling the police when someone turns up with a gunshot wound or injuries from a beating. ''We treat any patient in any type of gynecological or obstetric situation without distinction,'' said Dr. Hector Martinez, director of health services for the State Health Ministry. ''If we suspect that there is something, we inform the authorities. We don't accuse. We don't investigate.''",2010,"Mexico"
"346","Ruling on Women May Spur Asylum Claims","LA","GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A United States federal court ruling this week could unleash a wave of political asylum claims from applicants who say being a woman from Central America is reason enough to fear for their lives. The ruling concerns an application by a Guatemalan woman, but activists say hundreds of thousands of women from throughout the region could use it to argue that the United States should let them immigrate. In the ruling on Monday, the  United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  in San Francisco ordered immigration judges to reconsider whether Guatemalan women constituted a ''particular social group'' that might be persecuted. Courts have granted such status to women who fear genital cutting and to victims of domestic abuse, but two lower courts have said that Guatemalan women constituted too broad a category. Lawyers for the woman, Lesly Yajayra Perdomo, a health care company account executive in Reno, Nev., argued that a high murder rate for women in her native Guatemala meant that deporting her would constitute ''a death sentence.'' Activists say the same holds true for women in other countries, as well as for Guatemalan men. A number of men have already received asylum based on the high levels of violence in the country, said Mario Polanco, director of the human rights organization Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo. Last year, 709 women and 6,498 men were killed in Guatemala, a murder rate of about 49 per 100,000 inhabitants. That rate is much higher than that of Mexico, which has 14 murders per 100,000 residents. But it is still relatively low compared with Honduras, where the homicide rate was 67 per 100,000 people. El Salvador also had a higher murder rate than Guatemala's. ''The situation for women is hard on a regional level in Latin America, but it is even harder in Honduras,'' said Bertha Oliva, a Honduran human rights activist. She said the ruling ''should be extended to people from every country.'' Norma Cruz, director of the women's rights group Survivors Foundation, said that she expected a wave of applications after the ruling on Monday. ''I think there will be a lot more cases like this,'' she said. An estimated 1.5 million Guatemalans live in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of them have pending immigration cases. In 2009, the Department of Justice received 3,250 asylum applications from Guatemalans, and granted 155. It was unclear how many of the cases involved women. Women in Guatemala constitute 15 percent of murder victims, compared with 9 percent for Latin America over all, according to Carmen Rosa de Leon of Guatemala's Institute for the Teaching of Sustainable Development.",2010,"Guatemala"
"347","Allegations Link U.S. Companies to Brazilian Sex Tourism","LA","The Justice Department has been conducting a criminal investigation of sports fishing expeditions in the Amazon that may have been used as covers for Americans to have sex with underage girls, according to newly filed court papers. The investigation and two related actions -- a parallel criminal inquiry in Brazil and an unusual lawsuit filed in federal court in Georgia -- could provide a rare look at the business operations of the multibillion-dollar international sex tour industry, which has increasingly focused on Brazil. ''Brazil is taking over from Thailand as a premier sex tourism vacation'' spot, said Kristen Berg, an official of Equality Now, an advocacy organization in New York that helped bring the lawsuit in Georgia. That lawsuit was filed last month on behalf of four Brazilian women who claim that they were coerced as minors to serve as prostitutes for Americans on Amazon fishing expeditions operated by an Atlanta-area businessman. One of the women said that she was 12 years old at the time. Ms. Berg said the lawsuit was the first time that a federal law, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, had been used to seek damages from someone accused of operating sex tours. On Thursday, the defendant in that case, Richard W. Schair, filed a motion asking that the lawsuit be stayed. The motion cited continuing criminal investigations in the United States and Brazil. In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Schair, who operates an Atlanta-area real estate business, said that allegations that he was involved in child sex tours were untrue. He declined to discuss specifics of the inquiries. ''The allegations are false,'' he said. ''The facts will prove that.'' Solomon L. Wisenberg, a lawyer in Washington who represents Mr. Schair in connection with the federal criminal investigation, said he was confident that his client would not face charges. The status of the investigation is unclear, as Justice Department officials declined to comment. Ms. Berg, of Equality Now, said that the group helped bring the Georgia lawsuit because it was looking for precedent-setting cases involving child sex tourism overseas. She said that she and lawyers from a major firm, King & Spalding, which is working on the case pro bono, traveled to Brazil to interview prospective witnesses, including young women. Both the lawsuit and the federal criminal investigation are apparently fallout from a separate lawsuit filed in 2007 by Mr. Schair against another operator of Amazon fishing tours, Philip A. Marsteller. In that action, Mr. Schair charged that Mr. Marsteller had slandered him by telling people that he supplied clients on his fishing tours with prostitutes and drugs. Mr. Marsteller stood by his comments and, as part of his defense, sought statements from young women in Brazil as well as employees of Mr. Schair's company, called Wet-A-Line Tours. The company is no longer operating. In 2008, the two men settled the case, with Mr. Schair paying token compensation to Mr. Marsteller, said Kevin Buchanan, a lawyer in Dallas who represented Mr. Marsteller. Mr. Buchanan said that information that came up during the lawsuit led federal officials to begin an investigation of American business connections to child sex tourism in Brazil. Several news reports in recent years have indicated that Mr. Schair was the subject of criminal investigations both here and in Brazil. But the filing Thursday in conjunction with the Georgia lawsuit was the first time the investigations were publicly acknowledged. According to the court papers filed by Mr. Schair, federal prosecutors in Miami sent a grand jury subpoena to his company in 2009 asking for, among other things, customer lists. Another document shows that prosecutors notified his ex-wife in December that investigators had obtained information indicating that she was ''involved with a company and/or an individual who may have engaged in child sex tourism in Brazil.'' Asked about the documents, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Miami, where the inquiry is based, declined, as a matter of policy, to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. Translations of Brazilian documents, attached by Mr. Schair to his filing, show that he is charged in a proceeding there with the sexual exploitation of minors. He has denied the accusation. Mr. Schair made the filing on Thursday on his own behalf. According to the lawsuit filed last month, Mr. Schair or his employees or customers recruited young girls at a social club along the Amazon to join them on a fishing boat, where the girls were coerced into sex acts and paid.

Ciudad Juarez, Mexico WITH a sweet, awkward smile, Nancy Lilia Nunez offered up the main details of her life: she is a mother of three, having given birth to a daughter just seven months ago, and she is serving a 25-year sentence for helping to kidnap a 15-year-old girl. We were sitting at El Cereso -- the Ciudad Juarez prison -- a drab, hulking complex of brick and steel. Ms. Nunez wore tight jeans and eye makeup, as if heading to the mall. At one moment, she declared with simply stated conviction that she had no idea the 15-year-old girl was being held for ransom in the house where Ms. Nunez was arrested. The next, she seemed to be holding back information about the friends she was arrested with. Ms. Nunez is only 22. She grew up here, in one of the world's most crime-infested cities. But was she just hanging out with the wrong crowd, or is she a criminal deserving decades behind bars? With her case and others, this is what Mexico is struggling to figure out. The number of women incarcerated for federal crimes has grown by 400 percent since 2007, pushing the total female prison population past 10,000. No one here seems to know what to make of the spike. Clearly, the rise can partly be attributed to the long reach of drug cartels, which have expanded into organized crime, and drawn in nearly everyone they can, including women. Detained lieutenants for cartels have told the police that some act as lookouts. Other women work as drug mules, killers, or as ''la gancha'' (the hook), using their beauty to attract male kidnapping victims. At least one woman, Sandra Avila Beltran, became a major cartel leader, before her arrest in 2007 for trafficking and money laundering. Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising. More women are working in every aspect of the economy, ''including drug trafficking,'' said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an assistant professor of government at the University of Texas, Brownsville. Yet, because Mexico's justice system is so opaque, incompetent and corrupt, it is nearly impossible to know which prisoners deserve their punishment. Human rights lawyers say this is especially true for women, who are often unwittingly used by men they love. Several women at the prison, for example, said they only realized after their arrests that the cars they were caught driving had been packed full of drugs by boyfriends or brothers. And in a society as traditional as Mexico's -- where women are responsible for virtue and order, as Octavio Paz once wrote -- mere involvement in crime is enough to cause outrage and fascination. Mexicans (and Hispanic telenovela viewers in the United States) simply cannot get enough of feminized crime. One of the most popular novels in Mexico today is ''Queen of the South,'' which follows a Mexican woman who becomes the most powerful drug trafficker in southern Spain. When Telemundo made it a telenovela this year, it became a ratings bonanza on both sides of the border. Many of the women at El Cereso have received similar notoriety. Eunice Ramirez, 19, is the most famous. She was arrested last November for luring men into places where they could be kidnapped, and immediately photos from her Facebook page appeared nationwide, mostly showing her in a bikini. American border patrol agents say that they have also been catching more attractive teenagers in short skirts with drugs taped to their inner thighs. The result, here at least, is a female prison population both gang-connected and perfume-scented. Most of the 160 women here at El Cereso -- one of several prisons with women a few walls apart from male inmates -- are between 18 and 26. At least a third are still awaiting trial, most are charged with drug possession or trafficking, and daily life in their shared cells looks almost juvenile. Ms. Nunez's walls feature a poster of Disney princesses; others are decorated with heart stickers. This is nonetheless a dangerous place. Guards separate the women, as they do the men, by gang affiliation. Conflicts are common. ''Every day,'' said Ms. Nunez, her neck full of bruises, ''there is at least one fight.'' Or worse -- a week after our visit, 17 inmates, including one woman, were killed in what the authorities described as a series of gang executions with automatic rifles smuggled into the complex. It only highlighted the wide gap between the sexy myth of feminized crime, as portrayed on the Web and in telenovelas, and the more complex reality. Ms. Ramirez in particular fails to live up to her sensational billing. In person, she is painfully shy, speaking with a heavy lisp, barely above a whisper. When we met, she was busy with her visiting 2-year-old daughter, who had her mother's onyx eyes, and a face severely scarred by burns sustained when arsonists burned down the family's house after Ms. Ramirez's arrest. Some of the women here say they turned to crime to make money to meet their children's needs. Other mothers, maintaining their innocence, say they are racked with guilt for being forced to abandon their families. Ms. Nunez, who arrived here three months pregnant, said her biggest regret was ever becoming friends with the group involved in the kidnapping. Although several in the group, men and women, are also inmates at El Cereso, she said: ''We never talk. I have no one.'' Indeed, above all else, the women seem to feel lonely and misunderstood. Karla Solorio, 26, serving time for a drug conviction, said that she often cried at night thinking of her 7-year-old son. ''I'm just a reject,'' she said, dabbing at her eyes to avoid ruining her makeup. ''I'm not someone who works. I'm not someone with a family. I'm just a prisoner.''

"349","Peacekeepers' Sex Scandals Linger, On Screen and Off","LA","UNITED NATIONS -- On screen, two senior United Nations officials in Bosnia are arguing about firing Kathy Bolkovac, an American police officer battling to stop peacekeepers from both trafficking in young women and frequenting the brothels where they became indentured prostitutes. ''It is a point of honor for me that the U.N. is not remembered for raping the very people we must protect,'' says Madeleine Rees, a spirited human rights advocate played by Vanessa Redgrave. ''Those girls are whores of war,'' growls the male bureaucrat heading the United Nations mission. ''It happens; I will not dictate for morality.'' Ms. Rees, the director of the human rights office in Sarajevo from 1998 to 2006, said that dispute in the movie ''The Whistleblower,'' recently released in the United States, was lifted almost verbatim from a running argument she had around 2001. A decade later, a string of sex scandals from Bosnia to the Democratic Republic of Congo to Haiti involving peacekeeping missions has forced the United Nations to change the way it handles accusations of trafficking, rape and related crimes. But the issue still bedevils the institution -- a point underscored by the skirmishing among senior United Nations officials over whether to embrace the movie or try to ignore it. The issue has certainly not gone away. This week, hundreds of Haitians protested in support of an 18-year-old who said he was sexually assaulted by peacekeepers from Uruguay on a United Nations base, eliciting a furious rebuke from Haiti's president and an apology from Uruguay. The United Nations has focused serious attention on addressing sexual crimes among the more than 120,000 personnel it has deployed in 16 peacekeeping missions globally, including widespread training. But the question that diplomats, advocates and even some United Nations officials ask is why the efforts still lag in terms of investigating accusations and, most important, making sure those who send troops and contractors abroad hold them accountable. Human rights experts and some member states fault the United Nations for leaving too much of the job of enforcing its ''zero tolerance'' policy announced in 2003 to the countries contributing troops. Individual cases and any disciplinary action are rarely made public. ''They never come up with actual facts; they never come up with actual cases,'' Ms. Bolkovac said. She won a wrongful dismissal case in 2003 against a subsidiary of Virginia-based DynCorp International, which was contracted by the State Department to provide police officers for the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia. But Ms. Bolkovac says she has never been hired by another peacekeeping mission. (DynCorp issued a statement noting that ''The Whistleblower'' was a work of fiction and that new owners had since enacted their own zero tolerance policy.) United Nations officials brandish the statistics published on the organization's peacekeeping Web site as evidence of transparency. The numbers, whose source is somewhat vague, indicate that cases dropped from 108 substantiated accusations of sexual exploitation and abuse in 2007 to 85 in 2008, then to 63 in 2009, 33 last year and just 5 so far in 2011. But more than 200 such accusations remain unresolved, and the United Nations annual report on such crimes for 2010 noted that sexual activity with minors and nonconsensual sex represented more than half of reported accusations, little changed since 2008. Cases have come to light where peacekeepers paid children $1 or with candy to make a rape seem like prostitution. Finally, efforts to gather information from troop contributors about legal or disciplinary action are often ignored. The United Nations got answers roughly a quarter of the time, or 88 responses from 333 queries sent, since 2007, according to its figures. Senior officials defend the numbers as improving, and argue that publicly shaming member states would make finding peacekeeping troops more difficult. ''Going into a blame and shame approach is counterproductive because this requires a mind-set change,'' said Susanna Malcorra, head of the logistics end of peacekeeping. Activists and some diplomats condemn the United Nations as timid, with internal policing particularly weak under Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Ban waged an extended feud over hiring with the head of internal oversight before she left in 2010, leaving dozens of investigator jobs empty. Senior officials admit that its investigators have the mandate to do more to track sexual abuse cases. The United Nations pays $1,024 a month per soldier, making peacekeeping a profitable venture for many poorer nations. In June, member states voted themselves a bonus of roughly $100 per soldier per month, costing $85 million, for the coming year. The United Nations lost an opportunity by not hinging the bonuses on better cooperation, advocates contend. ''Member states are not reliable enough to do a good job on their own, especially in the early stages of a military investigation,'' said Prince Zeid Raad Zeid al-Hussein, the Jordanian ambassador and the author of a damning study of sexual exploitation in peacekeeping in 2005 as special adviser on the issue under the previous secretary general. Mr. Ban never filled the post. Member states rejected the study's recommendations to establish a coordinated, nimble investigation and discipline process. Soldiers serving the United Nations are subject to their own countries' military justice. The only wrist slap often faced by contractors is being sent home, because they enjoy immunity as United Nations employees. Soldiers linked to crimes are often repatriated. In April, 16 peacekeepers from Benin were sent home from Ivory Coast -- more than a year after Save the Children U.K. found that the soldiers traded food for sex with poor, underage girls. More than 100 troops from Sri Lanka were sent home from Haiti in 2007 because of widespread accusations of sex with minors. In many cases, however, the final outcome remains a mystery. ''The U.N. is not even a player in the investigation, doesn't know the evidence and has no way to follow up with the way the military decides to deal with this issue,'' Prince Zeid said. ''We, the member states, have by and large failed to do what I had hoped we would do.'' The State Department's 2010 report on human trafficking criticized the United Nations, saying, ''No comprehensive information is available on the number of cases of disciplinary action.'' A leaked memo from the United Nations human rights office in New York reflected the divisions over openness. In a lengthy discussion about how to address ''The Whistleblower,'' Kiyotaka Akasaka, the head of public information, and Patricia O'Brien, the top lawyer, argued for playing down the movie and certainly not screening it at the United Nations headquarters, the memo said. But the executive director of the newly created agency U.N. Women, Michelle Bachelet, the former president of Chile, argued for a more open approach, it said, along with several others. Mr. Ban wrote to the film's director, Larysa Kondracki, saying he had watched the movie with his senior advisers and was ''pained'' by it. ''Your film points to one area where our work left questions behind,'' he said. A public screening will be held at the United Nations soon, he told her.  Kathy Bolkovac",2011,"Haiti"
"350","Wave of Violence Swallows More Women in Juarez","LA","CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico -- First, there were just a few bones and body parts, found in a valley beyond the sprawl of this wild city. At least four women had been killed and dumped, the authorities said. Then, in the same area, investigators made another discovery early this year: a dozen more dead women and girls. Most disappeared in 2009 and 2010, and when last seen alive many were teenagers, good students with bright smiles of possibility. In death, however, they have become apparitions. Idali Juache's mother still insists her daughter is missing, though the police linked her DNA to cranial fragments in the valley's grave. Elvira Gonzalez said she felt what seemed like her daughter's spirit at home, before finding out she had been dumped in the grave. ''I never believed this was how she would be brought back to us,'' Ms. Gonzalez said, fighting tears in her modest kitchen. ''I always believed she'd be given back to us alive.'' Ciudad Juarez became infamous for a wave of attacks beginning in the 1990s that left hundreds of women dead over the course of a decade. International attention moved on, but the killings have continued, with a second wave even larger than the first. Even as overall violence here declines, new clusters of slain women are continually being discovered. Roughly 60 women and girls have been killed here so far this year; at least 100 have been reported missing over the past two years. And though the death toll for women so far this year is on track to fall below the high of 304 in 2010, state officials say there have already been more women killed in 2012 than in any year of the earlier so-called femicide era. This time, though, the response has been underwhelming. ''People haven't reacted with the same force as before,'' said Gustavo de la Rosa, a human rights investigator for Chihuahua State. ''They think it's natural.'' Mexican authorities have made promises to prioritize cases like these for years, and in the wake of international pressure, prosecutors now argue that more of the killings are being solved. But arrests and convictions are exceedingly rare. For the victims found in the mass grave in the Juarez Valley, even the most basic details were still a mystery months later: forensic teams said they were not even sure how many women were buried there. To many, these women are now part of what looks like a slaughter with peaks and valleys, but no end. In the state office opened a few years ago to investigate violence against women, desks are perpetually covered with stomach-turning case files. ''It's a more vulnerable group,'' said Hector Hawley, the forensics investigator charged with documenting the crime scenes of most of the women killed in Ciudad Juarez. ''These are not people we expect to see killed.'' Mr. Hawley has been working murder cases since 2003. He started specializing in women in recent years, and in his view, the stunning tally of women killed is mostly caused by the increased local involvement in gangs and drugs; and jealous men. Often, both gangs and jealousy come together in a single case. He opened a file on his computer showing one of the 18 women killed in April. Photographs showed that she had been dumped in a public street, and found around 8 a.m. ''She was stabbed 63 times,'' Mr. Hawley said. Her pink shirt, featuring an image of a heart, was stained with blood. Based on the number of stab wounds, he said, ''The killer had to be on drugs.'' He opened another file, showing a woman, shot dead, at the bottom of a garbage pile. ''She was pregnant,'' he said. ''We think she owed her bosses money for something, drugs maybe.'' He clicked through several other cases showing women young and old, mostly shot and killed at close range. He and two investigators in his office said they did not have any specific information about the women found in the mass grave, but they warned against seeing their deaths as the product of a single cause. ''In Juarez, there's everything,'' Mr. Hawley said. ''There are jealous husbands, jealous fathers-in-law, there are women killing women.'' A government committee found a similar array of causes for the earlier wave of killings. After surveying 155 killings out of 340 documented between 1993 and 2003, the committee found that roughly half were prompted by motives like domestic violence, robbery and gang wars, while a little more than a third involved sexual assault. Victims' advocates, however, argue that the killings of the women found in the valley fall on the more bizarre end of the spectrum. Francisca Galvan, a lawyer who has been working with the parents of missing girls, said that Ms. Gonzalez's daughter, Perla, 15, was last seen downtown talking to a middle-aged man around lunchtime. Several other girls from the grave, along with some still missing, have also disappeared from locations nearby, Ms. Galvan said. All were around the same age and several looked very similar: posters hanging all over the city show that they had long, straight dark hair and skinny frames. ''The authorities, they don't want to see the truth,'' Ms. Galvan said. ''Life here just has so little value.'' Her own theories run the gamut: maybe the girls were targeted for organ theft, maybe the killers arrived as part of the surge in deportations that has sent thousands of immigrant criminals to Ciudad Juarez from the United States. Though it is unclear if the victims had been raped, she added, maybe the killings started as sexual assaults. American officials in El Paso said they were shaking their heads, too; when drug gangs are involved in high-profile killings, paid informers usually call with tips. But not in the case of the Juarez Valley grave. For the parents, grief has been compounded by the authorities, who, in the parents' view, have done far too little explaining. Several mothers of missing girls said that prosecutors had refused to let them visit the morgue, even as officials offered up conflicting tallies for how many female bodies were held there. ''They're liars,'' said Norma Laguna Cabra, Idali's mother. Ms. Gonzalez said that one state investigator even claimed to speak to the spirit of her missing daughter. She said he came to her house after the grave was found but before the identifications were announced. After lingering in Perla's room, he told her she wanted to give her a message: ''I'm on my way.'' ''Tell me where you are -- where should we look for you?'' Ms. Gonzalez said she shouted. But it was no use: ''I can't say,'' came the reply from the investigator. Two weeks later, the authorities told Ms. Gonzalez that Perla was dead. A deeply religious woman, she said she had concluded that the message -- whether real or fake -- could only have come from the devil because it increased her pain. ''Here, the only one who gives us justice and obedience to the law is God,'' she said. ''And there's no escaping.''",2012,"Mexico"

"352","Haiti's Silenced Victims","LA","Athena Kolbe is a researcher from the University of Michigan School of Social Work and co-director of a social work institute in Pétionville, Haiti. Robert Muggah is the research director of Brazil's Igarapé Institute and a professor of International Relations at the Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro.  A TEXT MESSAGE was the first sign that something was wrong. In the week after Hurricane Sandy hit Haiti, our research team was assessing post-disaster crime, food security and service provision. The message came from a Haitian researcher in our group, an enthusiastic and talented graduate student whom we'll call Wendy. She had been walking alone a few blocks from our hotel when she was forced into a house and brutally raped. We quickly located a doctor but he refused to examine Wendy, saying she needed to be seen by the authorities first. We then contacted the police, and after a grueling interview in which one officer repeatedly asked Wendy, ''What did you do to make him violate you?'' the police said she was free to be examined. The doctor, however, couldn't be found. Although Haiti routinely suffers from political and natural disasters, rape is an especially insidious crisis. Haiti's brutal dictatorships used rape as a political tool to undermine the opposition. A 2006 study reported that some 35,000 women and girls in Port-au-Prince were sexually assaulted in a single year. In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, residents of the capital's tent cities were 20 times more likely to report a sexual assault than other Haitians. Haitian prosecutors are reluctant to pursue charges against rapists unless a victim is examined by a doctor within the first 72 hours to ''certify'' the assault, but few victims are able to satisfy this requirement. The police referred Wendy to a state-run clinic in the nearest large town, a three-hour drive over washed-out roads. When Wendy arrived she was told the doctor was out. A nurse mentioned that he could be found at a private clinic nearby. It had been more than 16 hours since the attack. Wendy hadn't slept or bathed. Her clothes were ripped and dirty. Dried blood matted her hair where the rapist had slammed her head against a wall. The doctor wanted verification from the police that a sexual assault complaint had been filed before he conducted an examination to retrieve fluids left by the perpetrator. The police were called but they claimed a ''fee'' was required before they would release a copy of the sexual assault complaint. A women's rights organization in the capital suggested we pay a bribe and complain to the policeman's superiors later. Our colleague drove several hours back to the town where the assault had taken place, paid a $25 bribe, and waited while the officer wrote up a report that merely stated that Wendy had lodged a complaint against a particular man but not that she had been raped by him. After some argument, the officer agreed to include the allegation of sexual assault. It took more than 24 hours before Wendy finally saw a doctor who admitted he'd never been trained to examine a rape victim. She cried the entire time. Random individuals wandered freely in and out of the room during the exam, including patients, nurses and a man visiting his sick wife in an adjacent bed. In North America, rape victims are often given medication to fight possible exposure to sexually transmitted disease as well as the morning-after pill. Wendy was terrified of pregnancy. She declared that although she didn't believe in abortion, she would rather ''die'' than have ''that man put a baby inside of me.'' Wendy knew about the morning-after pill but wasn't aware if it was available or legal in Haiti. The doctor falsely told her that after 24 hours it was too late to use it. After Wendy's exam, the police refused to pick up the medical report or fluid samples collected by the doctor. Instead, she was told to take them to a state-run medical clinic for sexual assault victims in the capital, a 15-hour drive away. The doctor then demanded an exorbitant fee for the medical report. The final document stated simply that Wendy had complained of being raped and was found to have evidence of sexual activity. No record was made of the bruises covering her thighs or the many lacerations on her body. BEFORE Wendy could shower, she had to return to the small town where the assault occurred for yet another interrogation by the police. Our colleague, meanwhile, was scouring pharmacies for the morning-after pill. He finally tracked down a pharmacist who knew what it was. But the medication, like most pharmaceuticals in Haiti, was imported. The instructions were in Arabic and Portuguese, neither of which the pharmacist could read. He didn't know which package contained the morning-after pill and which contained hormones taken by post-menopausal women. Nor did our colleague, who closed his eyes and picked a box, which by chance happened to be the right one. After taking the pill, Wendy slept for the entire ride to Port-au-Prince, helped into oblivion by the glass of homemade gin the doctor had prescribed. We had no intention of sweeping this incident under the rug. We contacted the police, women's rights organizations and various government ministries. We spoke with the police chief from the area where the assault had taken place. He said he had questioned the perpetrator, who claimed that Wendy had had sex with him willingly. Because the medical report made no mention of violent assault, the police officer in charge, who had seen her bruises and cuts himself, said there was nothing he could do. Calls to the women's rights organizations and other civil society groups confirmed that there was little to be done. ''You could pay something, give them a gift so they arrest the guy,'' one human rights worker suggested. ''But he'll probably just pay another bribe and get out.'' For decades, Haitian victims were blamed for inviting rape, and seldom spoke out. Politicians and the media perpetuated these stigmas. So did the law: a woman's testimony that she didn't consent to sex was insufficient for conviction, and monetary restitution or marriage to the rapist was considered a solution. A 2005 law made rape a punishable offense after intense lobbying from survivors and the Haitian Ministry of Women's Affairs. In 2010, the law was updated after chilling reports of rapes committed against the elderly and children. But old habits die hard. In Haiti, attitudes toward rape are similar to those that were common in the United States before the 1970s and '80s. Haitian officials often claim that residents of slums and displaced person camps are promiscuous. Despite new laws, few women will ever report the event because of the prevailing social norms that blame victims for their own assault. Even fewer survivors will be in a position to navigate the complicated procedures to bring charges against a rapist. Having an education, money and connections doesn't necessarily help. By the time Wendy returned to Port-au-Prince she wanted only to return to her family. Her mother thanked us for getting her medical attention and asked that we never mention the rape to Wendy again. Wendy said she just wanted to forget about it. She blamed herself for walking alone, for wearing borrowed pants that were too tight, for smiling and saying hello when the man first approached her, for freezing up and not screaming when he attacked her. Despite her education, resilience and dedication to fighting violence against women, Wendy could not bring herself to face the grueling road of rape prosecution in Haiti. So she dropped it and asked us to do the same. When we told the women's rights group she didn't want to pursue a case, they weren't surprised. ''It happens all the time,'' said a member of the staff. ''We get dozens of cases each month, and out of those sometimes not even one woman will put herself through this process.'' It is hard to blame them.",2012,"Haiti"

"354","Women Killed as 'Witches,' in Papua New Guinea, in 2013","LA","""They're going to cook the sanguma,"" or witchcraft, ""mama!"" This terrifying cry by Papua New Guinean children opens ""It's 2013, and They're Burning 'Witches,' "" a long and eloquent report in the Global Mail, an Australia-based online news site. It was published last week before news shot around the world on Tuesday that the police in Papua New Guinea, in another case, had charged two people with torturing and killing a 20-year-old mother, Kepari Leniata, whom they accused of being a witch. Ms. Leniata was ""stripped, tortured with a hot iron rod, doused in gasoline and set alight on a pile of car tires and trash"" earlier this month in front of a crowd of hundreds of people, including young children, The Associated Press reported. Why? ""Leniata had been accused of sorcery by relatives of a 6-year-old boy who had died in a hospital,"" The A.P. reported. The year 2013 or not, such violence against women is not uncommon in Papua New Guinea, where ""witches"" (in reality just women, often older ones) may be blamed when things go wrong, a reflection of the powerful belief in sorcery in Papua New Guinea, a Pacific nation just north of Australia. Women are often identified as  witches and attacked  when a man, or child, dies unexpectedly. But there may be other reasons. As the Australian international television station Australia Network reported, in a resource-rich country undergoing a boom, accusing a woman of being a witch is an easy way to take her land. Dame Carol Kidu, a Papua New Guinean politician, told the station: ""There are other things involved nowadays, like greed, acquisition of people's properties and land, and all sorts of things might be all be tied up in all of this, using killing the sorcerers as a reason to acquire land. So it needs to be investigated and we need to work out how we can deal with it. It is a very complex issue."" The United Nations also found that accusations of sorcery can be used to kill women for a range of motives. ""The U.N. human rights agency says they've seen an increase in these types of killings as well as torture and rape,"" United Nations radio reported recently. ""They say the accusations are often used to deprive women of land and property,"" What lies behind the ferocity? Traditional beliefs, alcohol and drug use among men, and uneven development in a country that is in the middle of a mining boom where, as the Global Mail said, ""the wealth bypasses the vast majority."" It said: ""Enduring tradition widely resists the notion that natural causes, disease, accident or recklessness might be responsible for a death. Rather, bad magic is the certain culprit."" The dead person if often a man; the culprit is a woman. Or a ""witch."" ""When people die, especially men, people start asking 'Who's behind it?' not 'What's behind it?' "" Philip Gibbs, a longtime resident, anthropologist, sorcery specialist and Roman Catholic priest,  told the Global Mail. But in its report, the news site was careful to point out that while many Papua New Guineans believe in sorcery to some degree, that does not mean that they support the lynchings. ""City and country folk alike overwhelmingly 'recoil in fear and disgust' at lynch mobs pursuing payback,"" it said. The article mentions Sister Gaudentia Meier, a Swiss nun who tried to save Angela, a woman accused of witchcraft. The article includes powerful photos of accused ""witches."" Hearing the children shout that a witch was about to be cooked, Sister Gaudentia rushed after them. ""Two days earlier, she had tried to rescue Angela (not her real name), an accused witch, when she was first seized by a gang of merciless inquisitors looking for someone to blame for the recent deaths of two young men."" Angela was luckier than Ms. Leniata. She had no male relatives to protect her (a common profile for accused ""witches"") and was horribly tortured, but lived, the article says. A ""sorcery survivor,"" today she is in hiding with her small son. ""Those victims who lived to tell the tale owe their lives either to individual police members or to a strong church leader who intervened for them,"" Father Gibbs told the Global Mail. ""In effect it means that, if sufficiently motivated to act, the power of the police and civil authorities, or the power of the church, can be enough to defend a person who is otherwise powerless,"" he said.",2013,"Papua New Guinea"
"355","U.N. Calls on Papua New Guinea to Curb Violence After Burning Death of Woman","LA","GENEVA -- Spurred by the killing this week of a young woman accused of witchcraft in Papua New Guinea, the United Nations on Friday called on the country to address increasing vigilante violence against people accused of sorcery and to revoke a controversial sorcery law. The United Nations human rights office in Geneva said it was deeply disturbed by the killing of the woman, Kepari Leniata, 20, who was stripped, tortured, doused in gasoline and set on fire on Wednesday as hundreds of spectators watched. The killing in Mount Hagen, the Western Highlands provincial capital, reportedly was carried out by relatives of a 6-year-old boy who, they claimed, had been killed by her sorcery. The crowd blocked police officers and firefighters who tried to intervene. ''This case adds to the growing pattern of vigilante attacks and killings of persons accused of sorcery in Papua New Guinea,'' Cecile Pouilly, a spokeswoman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters in Geneva. Ms. Pouilly said that police were continuing their investigation of a case in Jiwaka Province in November, when people held three women and two men for 20 days for allegedly using sorcery to kill another person, torturing them with iron rods and knives heated over fires before killing them. According to Amnesty International, violence against those accused of sorcery is endemic in Papua New Guinea. In a statement on Friday, the human rights organization cited reports that in July, the police arrested 29 members of a witch-hunting gang who were murdering and cannibalizing people they suspected of sorcery. A United Nations investigator who visited Papua New Guinea in March also found that women, particularly widows and those with no other family members to protect them, were disproportionately affected by the violence against suspected sorcerers, which included torture, rape, mutilations and murder. ''I was shocked to witness the brutality of the assaults perpetrated against suspected sorcerers,'' the investigator, Rashida Manjoo, said in a statement after her visit, reporting that many of the people she interviewed said sorcery accusations were commonly used to deprive women of their land and property. ''Any misfortune or death within the community can be used as an excuse to accuse such a person of being a sorcerer,'' Ms. Manjoo said. Attacks often were carried out by young men and boys acting on the instruction of their community and under the influence of alcohol and drugs given to them, Ms. Manjoo said she was told. They also often acted with impunity, she said, because witnesses feared talking to the police and followed a social tradition of ''wantok'' or solidarity. Responding to Wednesday's attack in Mount Hagen, the United Nations human rights office and Amnesty International urged Papua New Guinea's government to implement the recommendations of a constitutional commission that called in November for the repeal of the country's sorcery law. Human rights groups say the 1971 law, which criminalizes sorcery and recognizes the accusation of sorcery as a defense in murder cases, contributes to the violence. The commission's report and recommendations, however, have not yet been presented to the country's Parliament, Ms. Pouilly said. ''We don't know why nothing has been done since November,'' she said.",2013,"Papua New Guinea"
"356","Public Rapes Outrage Brazil, Testing Ideas of Image and Class","LA","RIO DE JANEIRO -- The attacks have stunned this city. In one, an assailant held a gun to the head of a 30-year-old woman while raping her in front of passengers on a bus as the driver proceeded down a main avenue. In another, a 14-year-old girl from a hillside slum was raped on one of Rio's most famous stretches of beach. In yet another case, men abducted and raped a working-class woman in a transit van as it wended through densely populated areas. The police failed to investigate, and a week later the same men raped a 21-year-old American student in the same van, pummeling her face and beating her male companion with a metal bar. ''Unfortunately, it had to happen to her before anyone would help me,'' said the Brazilian woman raped in the transit van. ''I was like, 'Could this have been avoided if they had paid attention to my case?' '' A recent wave of rapes in Rio -- some captured on video cameras -- have cast a spotlight on the unresolved contradictions of a nation that is coming of age as a world power. Brazil has a woman as president, a woman as a powerful police commander and a woman as the head of its national oil company -- and yet, it was not until an American was raped that the authorities got fully involved and arrested suspects in the case. In some ways, Brazil's experience echoes recent events in India and Egypt, where horrific attacks have prompted outrage and soul searching, revealing deep fissures in each society. In Brazil, it has unleashed a debate about whether the authorities are more concerned about defending the privileged and Rio's international image than about protecting women at large. In India, the recent death of a student, who was gang-raped as her male companion was beaten on a bus under similar circumstances, has highlighted a prevailing view that women, no matter how much progress they make, are still fair game, unprotected by an ineffectual government. And in Egypt, where the collapse of the old police state has led to an outbreak of sexual assaults in Tahrir Square in Cairo, some newly emboldened conservative Islamists publicly blame the women, saying they put themselves in harm's way. It is perhaps paradoxical that the issue has popped up so forcefully in Brazil, a country that has gone to great lengths to protect and promote women's rights. There are special cars for women to ride on trains to avoid being groped, as in parts of India. There are special police stations here staffed largely by women. And there is a general view that holds women as equal, fully capable of excelling in even the most powerful posts. ''We're living a schizophrenic situation, in which important advances have been made in women reaching positions of influence in our society,'' said Rogéria Peixinho, a director of the Brazilian Women's Network, a rights group here. ''At the same time, the situation for many women who are poor remains atrocious.'' Indeed, the public discussion about the string of sexual assaults in Rio was relatively muted before the American student was attacked in late March after boarding a transit van in Copacabana, a beachfront district frequented by tourists. The reason, some experts argue, was that the earlier victims were largely poor or working class, reflecting one of Brazil's enduring struggles: extreme class divisions in society. ''For a large part of the political leadership, these rapes only get to be a concern if they affect someone rich or damage Brazil's image abroad,'' said Malu Fontes, a newspaper columnist who criticized the lack of attention paid to rapes of poor women in Rio, which is preparing to hold the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. ''We like to believe in Brazil that we live in a peaceful, happy place, when the truth of our existence is far more complicated,'' she said. ''It's like we're Narcissus gazing into a pool of sewage.'' Rio's public security officials acknowledge that they have faced a sharp increase in the number of reported rape cases, which surged 24 percent last year to 1,972 in the city. But they argue that the increase has taken place nationally, reflecting a change in legislation in 2009 to broaden the definition of rape to include oral and anal penetration, as well as efforts to make it easier for women to file rape complaints. Brazil has made strides in its efforts to reduce violence against women. As early as the 1980s, it helped pioneer the creation of police stations with female officers to help victims register domestic violence, sexual assaults and other gender-related crimes. And in 2006, legislation was enacted nationwide intended to establish special courts for prosecuting acts of domestic violence with stricter sentences. But while Rio's authorities have succeeded in lowering rates of certain violent crimes, like homicides, the recent rapes have focused new attention on the dangers of riding Rio's buses and vans, an essential part of life for many residents. In the days after the rape of the American student, Mayor Eduardo Paes announced a ban on transit vans, which are privately owned and sometimes operating without permits, in Rio's prosperous South Zone. The ban prompted criticism that the mayor was giving priority to the safety of wealthy seaside areas over grittier parts of the city where the vans are still allowed to operate. A spokesman for Mr. Paes countered that the ban was not related to the rapes, but part of a broader public transportation plan under consideration for months. The spokesman added that the mayor had also forbidden vans to tint their windows, in an effort to prevent crimes within the vehicles. Officials in the state of Rio de Janeiro said that rapes in buses, vans or subway cars accounted for less than 1 percent of all cases in recent years. ''There are no signs of an epidemic of rapes within public transportation,'' said Pedro Dantas, a spokesman for Rio's public safety department. Still, the string of cases in Rio, including the rape of a 12-year-old girl on a bus last year, are part of a larger pattern of attacks and harassment aboard transit vehicles in several cities, including two rapes this month around the capital, Brasília. In the city of Curitiba, lawmakers are reviewing a bill that would introduce women's-only buses. Eleonora Menicucci, Brazil's minister for women's affairs, noted that no nation was immune to shocking crimes against women, pointing to the abduction and long imprisonment of three women in Cleveland. But she said Brazil had worked hard to encourage women to come forward to report rapes, and she contended that perpetrators would be prosecuted regardless of the backgrounds of the assailants or the victims. She cited a case in the city of Queimadas, where six men from relatively privileged circumstances were swiftly arrested, tried and convicted last year in the gang rape of five women, two of whom were killed after recognizing their assailants. But critics remain skeptical, arguing that the main reason the rape of the 14-year-old girl from a slum drew public attention was that it occurred on the beach in front of Leblon, one of Rio's most exclusive neighborhoods. Sérgio Cabral, Rio's governor, called the assault on the American student an ''atrocity'' but emphasized that he did not expect it to affect the image of Rio, which he was said was experiencing a ''forceful moment with big events and investments.'' A picture caption on Saturday with the continuation of an article about a recent wave of rapes in public locations in Rio de Janeiro that have cast a spotlight on conflicting notions of image and class in Brazil misstated the circumstances of the creation of women-only cars on trains in Rio. They were created several years ago in response to harassment concerns, not recently in response to the rapes.",2013,"Brazil"
"357","Papua New Guinea, Where Violence Can Seem Like the Norm for Women","LA","Papua New Guinea, a developing country of seven million people with a growing market in the mining of natural resources, is one of the most violent places in the world for women, according to the United Nations. In the country's remote Highlands, the Australian government found that nearly every woman has experienced some form of physical violence, including sexual violence. After decades of abuse from her husband, Agnes, who is now living in a safe house said: ''I thought that that was normal for a woman to be beaten by her husband. I never thought it wasn't right.'' The photographer Carey Wagner spent several weeks in this South Pacific island country documenting how a complex blend of traditional beliefs and lopsided gender dynamics have created a culture of violence in which women are particularly vulnerable. ''Men are being taught that this is the way that you should treat your wife, your sister or even your mother,'' said Paulina Castillo, a psychologist affiliated with a Doctors Without Borders clinic in Tari that treats women suffering from bush knife wounds or sexual abuse. Doctors and nurses at this remote clinic say they have never seen such regularly occurring violence outside of conflict zones. While violent customs are hard to overcome, the country is taking small steps to bring gender violence under control. In September, Parliament passed a bill that makes all forms of domestic violence a crime punishable with fines and jail time. ''In our culture, men think that they are the bosses and they have the right to control the woman,'' said Lydia, who recently filed an order for protection against her husband. ''I want women to know we have our own rights.''",2014,"Papua New Guinea"
"358","Honduran Beauty Queen and Her Sister Are Found Dead 6 Days After Disappearing","LA","MEXICO CITY -- María José Alvarado was to travel from Honduras to London on Wednesday to compete with some of the world's most glamorous young women in the Miss World pageant. Instead, seven months after she was crowned Miss Honduras, the police there said that her body, and that of her older sister, had been pulled from the sand of a riverbank near where she disappeared. A self-described foodie who loved Prada and lip gloss, Ms. Alvarado, 19, worked as a hostess on a popular television variety show, and was pursuing a degree in computing at a local technical college. She and her sister, Sofía, had not been seen since last Thursday, when they attended a birthday party for Sofía's boyfriend, Plutarco Ruiz, at a water park near their home in western Honduras. Mr. Ruiz was arrested Tuesday and the police told local news media that he is the leading suspect in deaths of the sisters. Their disappearance has riveted the country, where violence against women is all too common. Honduras has the highest peacetime murder rate in the world, according to the United Nations, and an estimated 95 percent of killings there go unsolved. Ill-trained police forces and underfunded prosecutors are unable -- and sometimes unwilling -- to investigate killings. But in the case of the missing beauty queen and her sister, the authorities sent trucks filled with military police officers rumbling through the western township of Santa Barbara and the surrounding areas in search of the women. Violence against women has risen sharply in Honduras over the past few years: The number of women killed rose 263 percent from 2005 to 2012, according to estimates from the Violence Observatory at the National Autonomous University of Honduras. ''Many girls die this way but because they aren't famous, nobody pays attention,'' said Salvador Nasralla, who ran for president last year on an anticorruption platform and who hosts the television show X-0 Da Dinero, on which María José had appeared. Widespread poverty, economic inequality and the spread of drug trafficking and gang violence have contributed to an increasingly savage environment in Honduras. Efforts by President Juan Orlando Hernández to fight mounting crime by creating a militarized police force have also contributed to an aggressive climate that further threatens women's rights, according to a report by a coalition of Honduran women's groups prepared for the United Nations. ''The climate of fear, in both the public and private spheres, and the lack of accountability for violations of human rights of women, is the norm rather than the exception,'' said Rashida Manjoo, the United Nations special rapporteur on violence against women, after a July visit to Honduras. Sofía Alvarado, 23, was a teacher and had been dating Mr. Ruiz for about three months, according to the girls' mother, Teresa Muñoz. The sisters shared a bedroom in their mother's modest home. The director of the National Police, Gen. Ramón Sabillón, said at a news conference Wednesday that Mr. Ruiz had shot Sofía during an argument after she danced with another man at the party. María José was shot twice in the back as she tried to flee, said General Sabillón, according to The Associated Press. In a statement on the Miss World website on Wednesday, Julia Morley, the chairwoman of the pageant, said, ''we are devastated by this terrible loss of two young women, who were so full of life.'' She said the pageant would hold a special memorial service with all of the Miss World contestants in London on Sunday. ''We are receiving messages of condolences and support from our Miss World family across the world, who all share our sadness at such a tragedy,'' she said. The police in Honduras said a second man, Aris Maldonado, was also arrested on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the owner of the water park, his wife and daughter were arrested on charges that they helped cover up the crime, officials said, adding that they expected to make additional arrests. Leandro Osorio, the director of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, told local news media that the police had found a gun in Mr. Ruiz's possession that they suspect was used in the shooting. His white Toyota pickup truck had been used to move the women's bodies and then sent to a nearby garage to be painted, Mr. Osorio said.",2014,"Honduras"
"359","A Clear Vision for Colombia; Italy's Role in the Great War; The Full Story on Women's Rights","LA","Re ''Colombia's compromise with murder'' (Opinion, Nov. 13) by José Miguel Vivanco and Max Schoening: Your article shows no awareness of the New Colombia. President Juan Manuel Santos has the strongest credentials in human rights protection and promotion. His administration has received international recognition, including from Human Rights Watch, for the progress made through victims' reparation and land restitution laws, and the historic peace process that aims to put an end to the 50-year armed conflict. At the core of this process lies the objective of recognizing and fulfilling the rights of the victims, past and present, and the guarantee of nonrepetition. Only a government with this record has the legitimacy to advance a clear judicial framework for the investigation and prosecution of human rights violations, including those committed by members of the armed forces. Legislation submitted to Congress, and the additions resulting from wide and public debate, interprets the political decision of the Santos administration to reassure that any criminal behavior that is not directly related to an act of service, including extrajudicial executions, will always be subjected to ordinary (civilian) justice. Contrary to the article's claims, the legislation will ensure accountability, transparency and due justice. That's the New Colombia's commitment. Luis Carlos Villegas, Washington The writer is the ambassador of Colombia to the United States. Italy's role in the Great War Re ''Remembering the end of the Great War'' (Nov. 12): Alan Cowell's interesting article mentions Britain, France and Belgium as the European victors of the Great War. But does anyone remember that Italy was a very significant contributor to that victory? Italy's part is regularly forgotten. Ask any member of America's millennial generation, and 9 out of 10 will probably tell you they didn't even know Italy was in the war. Professional historians, of course, know differently. Brian R. Sullivan, a former Yale professor and editor of the recently published book ''My Fault: Mussolini as I Knew Him'' by Margherita Grassini Sarfatti, wrote this about the Italian counteroffensive against the Austro-Hungarian empire: ''The Italian army fought with magnificent courage and skill. ... After several days of ferocious resistance, the Austro-Hungarians gave way. As they retreated, their army fell to pieces. The war on the Italian front ended a few days later.'' That war cost Italy at least half a million dead and 600,000 wounded or mutilated. Are old prejudices against Italy the cause of that lack of memory by her former allies? Mauro Lucentini, New York The full story on women's rights Re ''Comfort women and Japan's war on truth'' (Review, Nov. 15): Mindy Kotler claims that ''human rights and women's rights are pillars of American foreign policy.'' A large body of respected research, such as William Blum's ''Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions Since World War II'' and Michael Otterman's ''American Torture'' show that Ms. Kotler's claim is highly contestable. Particularly in an article about foreign (Japanese) human rights abuses, it is troubling that the author would make such brusque and matter-of-fact claims regarding American conduct. Ironically, Ms. Kotler's claim sheds important light on what drives the Japanese government's intransigence around the comfort women issue: the perception of a double standard and the resulting domestic political capital. Statements that assume the centrality of human rights in American foreign policy actually reinforce this notion of a double standard. For those of us who hope to see the issue of the Japanese Empire's treatment of comfort women practically addressed, tackling this perception (or reality) of a double standard would probably be a good place to start. Paul Duffill, Sydney, Australia The writer is a visiting scholar at the Center for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney. If truth be told, ordinary Japanese people are not aware of the truths that are described in this essay. This is due in part to the fact that the government has not given us the full story. Our leaders even continue to argue about whether wartime sexual slavery existed or not. Hirokazu Sato, Osaka, Japan",2014,"Colombia"
"360","Turkey Begins Campaign Against Homosexuality","MENA","Turkey's security forces, which have been waging a resolute campaign against terrorism, separatism and anarchy, have now struck out against male homosexuals. The Istanbul police raided the downtown Beyoglu district last weekend, closing down 11 places of entertainment that were said to illegally employ male homosexuals. At the same time, 22 male homosexuals were taken into custody, detained for 24 hours and removed from the Istanbul area amid scenes of protest and confusion. The military regime, which was established last September to restore law and order, has had considerable success in curbing political violence. Now it appears to be moving to cure what it perceives to be other ills of society. Obscene Magazines Banned In line with this ''curative'' action, the Adana Martial Law Command and the Sixth Army Corps in southeastern Turkey Until recently, homosexuality was an unpublicized and unaccepted phenomenon in this traditionally ''macho'' society. The only visible signs of homosexuality were to be found among the boy dancers in the rural areas. A few years ago, however, there was a kind of breakthrough when several transvestite nightclub singers and artists began to gain widespread popularity. Newspapers were full of their pictures and activities and helped to spread their fame. In fact, the top singer of traditional Turkish music today is Bulent Ersoy, a 29-year-old homosexual who recently underwent an operation to change his sex. Transvestites Are Warned At the beginning of the year, the authorities made it clear that under the new military rule, transvestites would not be tolerated.  The Istanbul Security Department warned that men would no longer be permitted to wear women's clothing on stage or in private life. Several popular singers, including Mr. Ersoy, were called into the Security Department and made to sign statements.  ''I declared that I would wear normal clothes while performing my art and from now on would not indulge in acts and manners which are not good for the eye,'' Mr. Ersoy was quoted as saying. Apparently unwilling or unable to give up his way of life, Mr.  Ersoy went to London last month and had a much-publicized operation to become a woman. Turkish newspapers now refer to the singer as ''Miss Ersoy.'' 22 Rounded Up in Raids In the recent crackdown on homosexuals, the police raided bars, nightclubs and dance halls, detaining 22 men dressed in women's clothes. They were said to have been engaged in ''illicit'' activity. Last week the Istanbul newspapers said in extensive reports on the incident that the 22 homosexuals had been detained and then expelled from Istanbul. Yalcin Peksen, a writer for the influential left-wing daily Cumhuriyet, reported that as journalists and photographers filled the room at the Security Department, some of the 22 homosexuals posed for pictures. When they were about to leave for the railway station, there was an uproar, with some of the homosexuals screaming and tearing off their clothes. Finally they were herded back into the room and the journalists were told to leave. After an hour, the homosexuals were reportedly ''calmed down,'' taken to the railway station and sent back to wherever they had come from, with a warning that if they returned to Istanbul, they would be imprisoned for six months.",1981,"Turkey"

As the situation became clearer, the police reported that 20 people had been killed and 16 wounded, and identified the killer as James Oliver Huberty. The ethnic identification proved incorrect. Even if the ethnic identification had been accurate, however, the comment should not have been published.

"363","CONGRESSMAN SAYS GIRL WAS CREDIBLE","MENA","The co-chairman of a Congressional panel has defended his decision to conceal the identity of a teen-age Kuwaiti girl whose account of Iraqi atrocities helped to stir American opinion in favor of the Persian Gulf war, arguing that the fact that her father was the Kuwaiti Ambassador to the United States did not alter her credibility. An article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times on Monday asserted that it was irresponsible for the Congressional Human Rights Caucus to propagate the accusation that Iraqi soldiers had removed scores of babies from Kuwaiti hospital incubators and left them to die without identifying the young woman beyond her first name, Nayirah. The girl's account, which was later disputed by independent human rights monitors, created a furor that helped convince several Senators to vote in favor of authorizing military action against Iraq. In the article, John R. MacArthur, publisher of Harper's Magazine, also criticized the Congressional panel for not demanding proof that the young woman had witnessed the atrocities she described. Sought to Protect Relatives Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California and co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, confirmed in an interview Tuesday the assertion that he obeyed the wishes of Saud Nasir al-Sabah, Kuwait's Ambassador to Washington, to conceal the 15-year-old's identity, saying he did so to protect relatives and friends living in Kuwait at the time. ""The notion that any of the witnesses brought to the caucus through the Kuwaiti Embassy would not be credible did not cross my mind,"" Mr. Lantos said. ""I have no basis for assuming that her story is not true, but the point goes beyond that. If one hypothesizes that the woman's story is fictitious from A to Z, that in no way diminishes the avalanche of human rights violations."" Representative John E. Porter of Illinois, the Republican co-chairman of the caucus, said that Mr. Lantos had not revealed the woman's identity to him either, but that he was not disturbed. ""The media happened to focus on her,"" he said. ""If she hadn't testified, they would have focused on something else."" In a statement, Ambassador Sabah said that his daughter had witnessed the atrocities she described, and that her presence in Kuwait at the time can be verified by the United States Embassy in Kuwait. Donations by Kuwaiti Lobby Mr. MacArthur, who has written a book on censorship and propaganda during the Gulf war, suggested in his article that Mr. Lantos and Mr. Porter did not choose to verify the teen-ager's accusation partly because of their close connections to Hill and Knowlton, a public relations company hired by Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a Kuwait-financed group that lobbied Congress for United States military intervention. Hill and Knowlton helped select the witnesses heard by the caucus. The article also said that the Congressional Human Rights Foundation, a private group founded by Mr. Lantos and Mr. Porter in 1985 to promote human rights, had its offices in Hill and Knowlton's Washington headquarters and that the public relations company provided a $3,000 rent reduction to the foundation. Furthermore, Hill and Knowlton's client, Citizens for a Free Kuwait, had donated $50,000 to the foundation. Mr. Lantos categorically denied that such donations had any relationship to his caucus's October 1990 hearing, saying it had also held hearings criticizing human rights violations by the Indonesian Government, another Hill and Knowlton client. Unlike Congressional committees, the human rights caucus does not originate legislation. Designed to highlight human rights abuses, the caucus receives its financing from funds appropriated to the offices of individual members of Congress.",1992,"Kuwait"
"364","Jan. 30 -Feb. 6: Human Rights Report; China Is Judged Harshly And Women Get Attention","MENA","Each year, when the State Department issues its report on human rights around the world, attention inevitably focuses on those findings that affect other parts of the nation's agenda. This year, the State Department criticized summary executions in Iran, acts of genocide in Bosnia and violations in more than 100 other countries. What drew more attention was its assessment of China, which was criticized for holding thousands of political prisoners, cracking down on freedom of speech and religion and putting dissidents in mental hospitals. This critique is hardly academic; President Clinton has pledged not to extend China's preferred-trading status unless it makes significant progress on human rights, and the report seemed to leave him little room to do so. There have been several recent actions -- freeing several political prisoners and allowing the Red Cross to visit others -- that indicate some Chinese concern about making the grade. But Timothy E. Wirth, the State Department official who oversees human rights policy, said ""much more significant progress is going to be necessary."" In addition, this year's report focused closely, for the first time, on the situation of women around the world. It painted an ugly picture. Maids are beaten in Kuwait. Young Thai women are coerced into prostitution. Most Sudanese girls face ritual mutilation. And in many African countries, women receive one-third as much education as men. Feminist groups, having suggested such a focus, applauded and expressed hope that the attention would improve the situation of women around the world.   STEVEN GREENHOUSE",1994,"Iran"
"365","A Well-Founded Fear","MENA","She makes women's clothes. In today's Algeria, that is a political act, and potentially a fatal one. Until last year, when she abandoned her market stall in Algiers, 38-year-old Naima Belahi imported fabric from France and Italy and sewed it into beaded evening gowns or stylish short dresses. Then, last March 10th, Algeria's Islamic insurgents ordered all women to veil themselves within a week or risk becoming legitimate targets of murder. The day after the deadline, militants killed a 16-year-old high school student who was walking to class without a head scarf. Ms. Belahi, visiting the U.S. at the time, was afraid to return home. She neither makes nor wears the shroudlike Islamic dress that must cover the female body. To do so, she feels, would be to signal agreement with the extremists. She has taken refuge with a Connecticut family and applied for political asylum. Unfortunately for Ms. Belahi, her case has fallen into a chaotic system that almost never considers persecution of women a basis for asylum. Despite growing worldwide abuse of women by religious extremists -- not just in Algeria but also in Afghanistan, Sudan, the Gaza Strip and Saudi Arabia -- the Immigration and Naturalization Service works from a sketchy manual that advises against accepting most sex-based claims. Asylum seekers must show a ""well-founded fear of persecution."" This can be based on race, religion, nationality or political views. Less commonly, it can be based on membership in a ""particular social group"" that is subject to abuse. In Algeria, more than 50 women have been killed since the Islamic insurgency began in 1992. Many more have been knifed or raped for working alongside men or wearing Western dress. The murdered women have included the principal of a co-ed school, a secretary who worked at a police station to support her unemployed siblings and a 22-year-old woman wearing jeans and buying cigarettes -- enough to identify her to the militants as a ""prostitute."" Yet when an Algerian doctor applied for asylum here this year, saying she had been threatened with death because she supervised male physicians, the I.N.S. case officer said that violence in Algeria was ""too random"" to support her claim to belong to a ""particular social group"" at risk of persecution. If Algeria's violence is considered too random to warrant asylum, awkward questions arise about countries -- including a close U.S. ally, Saudi Arabia -- where abuse of women is systemic. In 1993, after almost two years of deliberation, Canada granted asylum to a Saudi student known as Nada who had argued that she risked flogging and imprisonment for walking in the street with her hair and face uncovered. In the U.S., asylum experts say that Nada's predicament would most likely have been viewed by the I.N.S. as a matter of cultural mores rather than as persecution. But substitute race for sex and the American position seems untenable. Imagine a country half black and half white, where the blacks may not legally leave the house without a white's permission, or where they may be caned in the street for refusing to wear the official segregating dress. That is the situation for women in Saudi Arabia. Last spring, some experts in immigration law at Harvard Law School submitted guidelines on asylum for women to the I.N.S. with the hope that they might become the basis for a fairer assessment of claims of persecution. With anti-immigrant sentiment rampant in the Republican Congress, however, any attempt to liberalize I.N.S. standards is sure to meet resistance. Yet asylum seekers constitute a tiny fraction of the people seeking admission to the U.S. each year. Opening the gate wider to persecuted women is hardly likely to result in a flood of new applicants. Most of the persecuted women live in countries where men control their right to leave the country, or even the house. By granting asylum to women like Naima Belahi, the Algerian seamstress, the U.S. could send a powerful message to those who distort religion to justify terror. The message would be that Americans, too, hold certain things sacred -- and among them are liberty, equality, the pursuit of happiness and the right to hold one's own beliefs.",1995,"Algeria"
"366","Egypt to Appeal Ruling on Genital Cutting","MENA","The Egyptian Government will not allow female genital cutting in hospitals despite a court ruling in June that declared a ban on the practice null and void, Health Minister Ismail Sallam said in remarks published today. Mr. Sallam, quoted in the Government newspaper Al Akhbar, said his ministry was challenging the ruling at a higher level, the Supreme Administrative Court. A lower court, championing the Islamic fundamentalist cause against the Government, had declared last month that the official did not have the authority to ban the practice. Human rights and feminist groups deplored the decision, saying it would allow doctors to continue performing a ritual tantamount to mutilation. Some fundamentalists say the practice has its origins in Islam, but this is widely disputed. The newspaper said that according to Mr. Sallam, the ministry would not allow the operation to be performed in hospitals while the Supreme Administrative Court was reviewing the case. In the operation, usually performed on prepubescent girls, part or all of the clitoris and surrounding genitalia are excised. Sometimes the vaginal opening or even the external labia are sewn together. Side effects include hemorrhaging, surgical shock and sexual dysfunction.",1997,"Egypt"
"367","Court Backs Egypt's Ban On Mutilation","MENA","In a judgment that women's rights groups say will resonate throughout the Islamic world, Egypt's highest court yesterday upheld a ban on the genital cutting of girls and women, a ritual widely practiced in Africa. The decision by the supreme administrative court marks the culmination of several years of debate in Egypt between Government officials and some Islamic conservatives, who contend that the practice they call female circumcision is a cultural or religious issue, and not a matter for government or the courts. Yesterday's ruling overturned a lower court decision challenging the ban that was imposed by the Egyptian Health Ministry in 1996. The ruling cannot be appealed. Violations carry a three-year jail sentence. ""Circumcision of girls is not an individual right under Sharia,"" the court said in its judgment, striking down the argument that Islamic law condones the practice. ""There is nothing in the Koran that authorizes it,"" the court said. Asma Abdel Halim, a Sudanese lawyer based in New York who has been helping African women campaign against the practice, said that the Egyptian decision ""will give a tremendous boost to women, because they will now have a very strong weapon to use."" ""This decision from Egypt's highest court is really profound,"" Ms. Abdel Halim said in an interview yesterday. ""It is significant because Egypt has for a long time been the center of both Islamic scholarship and Islamic jurisprudence, and many people look up to Egypt."" Ms. Abdel Halim said it was also important that in Egypt, as elsewhere where what women's groups call female genital mutilation is practiced, the battle is being waged by local women. The practice includes removing a girl's clitoris, and sometimes much of the outer genital area, to strip her of sexual feelings. The ruling counters accusations that only outsiders -- ""neo-colonialists"" in the opinion of some who defend the practice -- are intent on ending it, she said. In Gambia in November, a grass-roots organization called the Gambia Committee on Traditional Practices succeeded in persuading the Government to lift censorship on the subject of genital mutilation, giving private groups freedom to campaign against it. Jessica Neuwirth, an American lawyer who is president of Equality Now, an international women's human rights organization that helped the Gambian and Egyptian campaigns, among many others, said on Sunday that Egypt's female genital mutilation task force should get the credit for making the issue of genital mutilation public. The task force included Government officials and representatives of a range of private organizations like the Egyptian Society for Prevention of Harmful Practices to Woman and Child. The cutting of a girl's clitoris and sometimes the outer lips of the vagina -- rough surgery often performed by traditional practitioners or family members wielding knives or razors -- can leave her severely damaged, prone to infections and, frequently, incontinent. Many girls bleed to death during or after the procedure. In extreme cases, women's organizations say, girls' or women's mutilated vaginas are stitched shut, then unstitched before and restitched after intercourse with their husbands, an attempt to make them appear to be permanently virgins. In Egypt, where the practice is very common among not only Muslims but also Coptic Christians, private and some Government clinics have been teaching medical staff members and patients about the dangers of genital cutting. Today's court decision ended -- at least legally -- a controversy that began when Egypt tried to stop the practice in Government hospitals and heightened after Health Minister Ismail Sallam announced in July 1996 that genital mutilation would be banned across the board in Egypt. The ban followed a long campaign by Egyptian human rights organizations and women's groups. In June of this year, Mr. Sallam's ban was overturned by a lower court in a case brought by proponents of genital excisions, who argued that it was an Islamic practice. The leader of the challenge was Sheik Yussef al-Badri. He argued in court that Islam had condoned the practice for 14 centuries. Islamic conservatives who defended the practice are not expected to give up the fight after yesterday's ruling. Sheik Badri was quoted by news agencies after the decision as saying that the high court had made a mistake and the judge would have to answer to God. A lawyer for his side threatened public opposition to the ruling. ""We want to tell people, the Prophet did not forbid circumcision and Muslims must not forbid it,"" said the lawyer, Ahmed al-Khuli.",1997,"Egypt"
"368","Slain Woman Was Daughter Of Diplomat","MENA","A young woman found shot to death in Cunningham Park in Queens on Thursday was identified yesterday as the 19-year-old daughter of the second-ranking diplomat in Yemen's Mission to the United Nations, officials said. The police said the victim, Lamis Kalaz of 150-28 76th Road, Kew Gardens Hills, was identified by her father, Ahmed Ali Kalaz, who was listed by United Nations officials as the Deputy Permanent Representative of Yemen's Mission. The woman had been shot twice, once in the head and once in the chest, and was found in one of the park's parking lots near Francis Lewis Boulevard and Union Turnpike in Fresh Meadows, about two miles east of her home. Investigators said they did not know who had killed her or why, but there was no suggestion that her death was related to her father's diplomatic work. The police regarded the murder of a member of a diplomat's family in New York City as extraordinary, especially at a time of dramatic declines in reports of violent crimes in the city. Veteran police officials and those who work in diplomatic circles said they could not recall a similar case. The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who was traveling in Uganda, was informed of the death but made no immediate statement. ""Of course, the Secretary General will express his condolences to the family and the members of the Yemeni delegation,"" said David Wimhurst, a spokesman. Neither the family of the slain woman nor the Yemeni Mission, which is located at 866 United Nations Plaza in Manhattan and is led by Ambassador Abdalla Saleh Al-Ashtal, issued a statement on the woman's death. The Republic of Yemen is a poor desert land of 14.5 million people at the southwest corner of the Arabian Peninsula. Dwight Williams, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said only that the Mayor ""is confident that the Police Department is investigating the matter thoroughly."" It was unclear how and when Ms. Kalaz went to Cunningham Park. Investigators said she may have been killed before dawn Thursday. She was found by a passer-by at 7 A.M., shot in the face and chest and lying on her side in a pool of blood in a parking lot on the western edge of the 324-acre park. She was clothed in blue stretch pants, a white T-shirt and a fake-leather jacket. The police said there were no signs of a sexual assault. The police declined to say whether robbery was suspected, though they said nothing was found in the victim's pockets. Lacking identification, the woman was listed as Jane Doe and taken to the Chief Medical Examiner's office in Manhattan, the police said. She was identified there by her father, who had reported her missing. No weapon was recovered, the police said. Investigators found a soda bottle on a picnic table 12 feet from the body, and were to test it for fingerprints to determine whether the victim, or possibly her assailant, had drunk from it. But the police declined yesterday to say if any prints had been found. Cunningham Park and the neighborhoods surrounding it are regarded as some of the safest areas in Queens, though some residents said they did not venture into the park at night. A spokesman for the city's Parks and Recreation Department, Craig Konieczko, said no one had been killed in Cunningham Park in four years.",1998,"Yemen"
"369","U.N. Criticism Angers Charities Buying Sudan Slaves' Release","MENA","Private charities that are buying freedom for enslaved children and young women in Sudan, have reacted angrily to recent criticism of them from Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. ""It is very difficult to understand why Unicef should say our activities are intolerable,"" said John Eibner head of Christian Solidarity International, of Zurich, which since 1995 has bought and set free 5,942 Sudanese children, spending about $50 a child. ""What is intolerable is to leave these women and children in the hands of brutal captors,"" said Charles Jacobs of the American Anti-Slavery Group in Boston, which helps raise money to support Christian Solidarity.  At a news briefing in Geneva in early February, a Unicef spokeswoman, Marie Heuzer, described the slave redemption program as ""intolerable"" after Christian Solidarity raised the topic by appealing to Secretary General Kofi Annan to condemn slavery in Sudan and to create a special program to trace and free enslaved women and children. Today, a Unicef spokesman, Peter Crowley, said the agency still has ""genuine concerns"" about buying freedom for children, adding that they were shared by some human-rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch. He said that buying back slaves did not offer ""a lasting solution"" to the problem, which he said can only come through bringing about an end to Sudan's on-again, off-again 30-year-old civil war pitting the Muslim north of the country against the Christian and animist south. The children were also being returned to villages that remain in the war zone and were subject to future slave raids. Another objection was one of principal, he said, because the buy-back program implicitly accepts that human beings may be bought and sold. This could also encourage slave-taking for profit. Mr. Crowley argued that buying freedom does nothing to change the underlying ""social attitudes"" of a people who are used to owning slaves and regard doing so as perfectly normal. Unicef has also contended that redeeming slaves for money helped prolong the civil war by giving combatants extra cash for buying arms and ammunition. But Christian Solidarity insists it pays for the slave it buys with Sudanese pounds to avoid introducing dollars into the region because they could be used for purchasing arms. Human Rights Watch emphasized that its own position on the slave buying issue is ""nuanced."" Reed Brody, the organization's Advocacy Director, agreed that buying back slaves creates a ""real danger of fueling a market in human beings"" in a country as desperately poor as Sudan. He called slavery there a ""very troubling issue"" but said that the real challenge it raises is that of finding an end to a long war which he said neither side can ever hope to win. Mr. Brody pointed out that human-rights organizations and the United Nations Human Rights Commission have long been calling for international monitors to be sent to Sudan to trace children taken into slavery and secure their liberation. But no action has been taken. In a 1996 report on slavery in north Africa, a representative of the Human Rights Commission accused Sudan's Government forces of regularly abducting and transferring women and children from southern conflict zones to the north, where they disappeared.  http://www.nytimes.com",1999,"Sudan"
"370","Fired Diplomatic Employee Can Sue Saudis, Judge Rules","MENA","A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that a former employee of the Saudi Mission to the United Nations who claimed that she was fired for espousing women's rights may sue for discrimination despite Saudi claims that her suit is barred under diplomatic immunity. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court, held that the suit by Rajaa Al Mukaddam, who worked as a senior speechwriter in the Saudi Mission for 14 years before she was dismissed in 1998, fit a narrow exception to diplomatic immunity, opening the door to the possibility of monetary damages against the Saudis. Ms. Al Mukaddam, a naturalized United States citizen born in Lebanon, claimed in her lawsuit that she had also endured several years of sexual harassment and hostility from ""male fundamentalist members"" of the Saudi Mission, which increased after she complained. Ms. Al Mukaddam, whose age was not available, claims that she was abruptly fired after she made a presentation to the United Nations secretary general about creating a foundation to provide support to one million poor women worldwide. A lawyer for the Saudi government said it was considering its options, which include an immediate appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, an exceptional step allowed in lawsuits against foreign governments. Usually, pretrial rulings may not be appealed until a trial is over. The lawyer, Alexandra A. E. Shapiro, said the Saudi Mission fired Ms. Al Mukaddam ""for legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons,"" but would not elaborate. She said the ruling placed the Saudi government and potentially other foreign governments in a position where they are ""essentially subject to blackmail."" The Saudi government, she said, would either have to waive its diplomatic privileges to defend itself in the lawsuit -- for example, allow Saudi officials to testify -- or simply not defend the suit and be forced to pay a judgment ""even where, as in this case, the claims have no merit,"" Ms. Shapiro said. She added that the United States could find itself in similar situations abroad; for example, it might have to defend its employment practices at a diplomatic mission in a country with a very different legal system or customs, like one governed by religious law. Bobbi C. Sternheim, who represents Ms. Al Mukaddam, said that her client had no comment because the case was pending, but that Ms. Al Mukaddam was ""very pleased"" with the ruling, ""and we are confident that we will prevail at further proceedings."" In seeking the suit's dismissal, the Saudi government said Ms. Al Mukaddam was ""a professional civil servant whose duties were to carry out a foreign policy function,"" the judge wrote. The Saudis cited the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 and the Vienna Convention, both of which it said gave its mission absolute immunity with regard to hiring and firing decisions. The Saudis' view was supported by the United Nations. A United Nations official, defending the immunity argument, wrote to the judge that any measure that might hinder the ability of a mission to function would contravene the United Nations Charter. In issuing the decision, which was released Friday, Judge Kaplan did not address the merits of the suit, and accepted the allegations as true for the limited purpose of deciding whether to allow the suit to go forward. Judge Kaplan ruled that Ms. Al Mukaddam fit an exception to diplomatic immunity that applies to commercial activity. The judge also noted that she was hired in the United States and was not a Saudi civil servant, and that her work, which included research and clerical tasks and drafting speeches that were delivered by Saudi officials to the United Nations, was not of a diplomatic nature. http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Saudi Arabia"
"371","U.N. Panel Says Strict Saudi Laws Violate Rights","MENA","In a rare public rebuke, a United Nations panel criticized Saudi Arabia today, saying it discriminated against women, harassed youths who violated dress codes and applied ""inhuman"" forms of punishment, including flogging and stoning. The panel, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, said ""narrow interpretations of Islamic texts"" by Saudi authorities have led to violations of an international agreement protecting the rights of children. The committee's comments came after it examined Saudi Arabia's compliance with the United Nations treaty on children's rights. The inquiry marked the first time Saudi Arabia has allowed a public review of its human rights record. Saudi officials could not be reached for comment today, the Muslim Sabbath. Saudi Arabia follows Shariah, a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Courts may hand down sentences of amputation for robbery and public execution for murder, rape, sodomy and drug trafficking. Women are not allowed to drive and must be covered head to toe in public. ""The committee is concerned by the persistence of discrimination,"" the panel said in a statement. It highlighted treatment of girls, children born out of wedlock and Saudi women married to foreigners. The panel said Saudi law did not define the age of adulthood, leading to concern that people under 18 may be put to death. The panel also voiced concern at ""restrictions on the freedom of religion"" and about reports that the religious police in Saudi Arabia ""routinely harass and assault persons under 18 for dress code infractions.""",2001,"Saudi Arabia"
"372","Broadcast of Rape Angers Women's Groups in Israel","MENA","Israeli state television this week showed a home video of a rape that was taped by the rapist himself, generating outrage from women's groups. In the video, which was shown midweek on the Israeli Broadcasting Authority's Channel One evening news, a Haifa man was shown physically attacking and verbally abusing his housecleaner. The woman's naked body was at times exposed to the camera, although her face was blacked out, and she was moaning and begging to be left alone. The attacker wore a long coat and his face was not shown. The news anchor explained that the television station had obtained the clip as part of six hours of videotape in which an attacker documented his raping and sodomizing of a woman. The man, identified as Sergi Golov, has been convicted of the rape and is awaiting sentencing by a Haifa court, the reporter said. Rafik Halabi, head of the Channel One news department, told the Israeli news wire, Itim, ""The pictures were difficult and we blacked out the faces,"" he said. ""This is a document that should shock society, in order to protect women from the aggression of men, and I hope the broadcast will lead to the suppression of this shocking phenomenon."" But female politicians and women's advocacy groups said they could not see the socially redeeming value of broadcasting the tape and called it a ""second rape"" of the woman. They demanded that the broadcasting agency explain why the video had been shown and whether the woman had given her permission, suggesting that a ratings competition with the privately owned Channel Two had motivated the producers of the news. ""To broadcast the video of a rape in the guise of a report about violence against women is the worst possible thing to do to victims of rape,"" Yuli Tamir, a departing minister in Prime Minister Ehud Barak's cabinet, told the Maariv newspaper.",2001,"Israel"
"373","In Turkey, a Matter of Conviction; Women Who Spoke Against Police Abuse Face Prosecution","MENA","Nazli Top was walking home from work nine years ago when she was stopped at a security checkpoint. She says she was taken to a police station where she was held captive for 10 days by officers who beat her, prodded her with electric shocks until her body went numb, then raped her with a truncheon. She was 32 years old and three months pregnant. Last June, Top told her story at Turkey's first public conference on the abuse of women in police custody -- an event women's rights advocates hailed as a milestone in a country in which sexual violence against women is frequently ignored, covered up or deemed taboo for public debate. Six months later, Top and 18 other conference speakers and organizers were charged with ""insulting and raising suspicions about Turkish security forces."" If convicted, each could receive a six-year prison term. ""The police who did this should be standing here -- not me,"" Top told the judge hearing her case. ""I am being victimized for the second time."" The prosecutions come during an intensifying struggle over freedom of expression and individual rights in a country torn between the march toward integration with the European Union and an entrenched culture that protects government institutions from rigorous public scrutiny. ""If this was a democratic country, officials would start investigations against the police instead of going after the people making the accusations,"" Top, a nurse in the research laboratory of a hospital in suburban Istanbul, said in an interview. Human rights advocates say Turkey's laws against insulting or belittling the government are often used to silence journalists, intellectuals, government opponents and victims of abuse by police and military forces. European Union officials evaluating Turkey's membership application have demanded it abandon or moderate such laws. Amnesty International asked Turkish authorities to drop the charges against Top and her co-defendants ""who are guilty only of peacefully expressing their views."" Instead, the government recently reviewed the speeches made by several of the participants and filed new charges against five of the women, accusing them under Turkey's anti-terrorism laws of spreading separatist propaganda, according to Fatma Karatas, an attorney and one of the women facing the additional charges. Those laws, which cover a broad range of religious and ethnic issues, are among the most frequently used in freedom of expression cases in Turkey, Karatas said. Another of the five women targetted with the additional charges is a 45-year-old Kurdish mother of five who is suing seven policemen for torture and rape during 33 days she was detained in 1992 in southeastern Turkey, where Kurdish separatists led a rebel uprising against Turkish forces. Prosecutors in the cases against the conference participants did not return several telephone calls requesting comment on the government's position. Government authorities traditionally defend the laws used in this case as necessary to protect the state from separatist and religious extremist groups. ""This conference was the first of its kind,"" said Nahide Kilic, an official of Initiative Against Sexual Abuse and Rape in Custody, an Istanbul-based victim support group that helped organize the meeting last June. ""People came forward and talked about their experiences to set an example for those too scared to come forward. Now, with these charges, the state wants to silence the people."" Participants in the Assembly Against Sexual Harassment and Rape Under Detention, which was attended by about 2,000 people, said they were stunned by the government's charges because the conference had been approved by the government and most of the victims had revealed details of their allegations in unsuccessful court cases against the police or in other official complaints. Many of the speakers highlighted the court's reluctance to prosecute members of the security forces accused of raping or otherwise abusing detainees, especially women. ""Amnesty International has documented a general climate of impunity for those suspected of torture and ill-treatment in Turkey,"" the human rights group wrote in a recent report. ""Even where complaints of serious human rights violations are pursued by the authorities and security officers are prosecuted, only a negligible proportion of them are eventually convicted. In cases where a conviction occurs, security officials often receive the lightest possible sentences."" Amnesty International cited figures it said were obtained from the Turkish government that show convictions for only 10 of 577 security officials accused of torture between 1995 and 1999. During the same period, 2,851 investigations into other forms of alleged ill-treatment of detainees resulted in 84 convictions. Turkish authorities have said they were attempting to eradicate such incidents of torture and were trying to increase protection for detainees. But women's rights advocates said Top's case was representative of the victims' experiences. Top was walking home from the hospital where she worked on a late spring afternoon in 1992 when police investigating an attack on a nearby police vehicle stopped her to check her identification. After driving her to a police station and questioning her for hours, Top said one of the policemen told her, ""Now we're going to take you to the operating room. But it's not like the ones you've seen in your hospital."" ""They beat me with sticks with sharp ends,"" Top said, her hands shaking as she recounted the incident. ""They tied my hands behind my back and hung me from a rope. They hit me like a punching bag. ""They put electric shocks on my breasts and genitals and all over my body. They kept increasing the voltage. After awhile I was numb, I didn't even feel the electricity. Then they raped me with a truncheon."" Top said she survived by talking to the baby she was carrying, even though she feared the fetus had died from the abuse. Her son survived. When police released her several days later after pressing no charges, Top was taken to a crowded room where a doctor was examining detainees. The doctor asked, ""Do you have any complaints?"" ""I was tortured,"" Top said. ""Everyone is tortured,"" the doctor replied. ""Do you have any other complaints?"" Top's case against the police who allegedly detained her dragged on for 2 1/2 years until the judge dropped all charges against them, accepting the prosecutor's explanation that Top had inflicted bruises on herself and had obtained a fake medical report from the hospital where she worked. Top said she decided to address the Istanbul conference last year because, ""When I was apprehended, there was no organized resistance. Now there is, and I'm part of it.""",2001,"Turkey"
"374","Iran Executes Worker Who Strangled 16 Women Over 2 Years","MENA","A man who strangled 16 women with their head scarves in the northeastern city of Mashad was hanged early this morning in the prison compound, state radio reported. Saeed Hanai, 39, a construction worker, was sentenced to death after he confessed that he had strangled 16 women, many of whom had criminal records for drug abuse and were said to have worked as prostitutes. ""They were as worthless as cockroaches to me,"" Mr. Hanai was quoted as saying on Tuesday in the daily Norouz, a day before his execution. ""Toward the end, I could not sleep at night if I had not killed one of them that day, as though I had become addicted to killing them,"" he was quoted as saying. The arrest of Mr. Hanai came more than two years after the first body of a strangled woman was found. Many Iranians had speculated that the police, who are controlled by religious hard-liners, were intentionally lax in finding the killer since the victims were drug abusers and prostitutes. Mashad, where Mr. Hanai killed the women, is a holy city and home to a major Shiite Muslim shrine. Residents had feared that an extremist religious group might be behind the slayings, particularly after hard-liners were blamed for the murders of dissidents in Tehran. Mr. Hanai admitted to killing 16 women; the bodies of 19 women have been found in Mashad in the two years since the first death. Mr. Hanai's arrest came after Parliament took up the case with the highest provincial authorities. The deputies summoned the security and intelligence chiefs and eventually a special squad was sent to Mashad from Tehran. Mr. Hanai said in court that he began killing the prostitutes after his wife was mistaken for one. He said he blamed the large number of prostitutes in the city for the incident and believed killing the women was a religious obligation. He said he chose his victims while riding in his car or on his motorbike and took them to his home when his wife and three children were away. Then he strangled them with their head scarves, wrapped their bodies in head-to-toe black chadors and dumped them in the streets. After the third killing, he told the court, he dumped the body on a street, waited for the police to come and then helped them load the corpse into an ambulance. He was arrested after an intended victim became suspicious and managed to punch him in the stomach and run away. She reported the incident a few days later, according to Iranian news media reports, after she overcame the fear of what the police would do to her. Following Mr. Hanai's arrest, hard-liners began a campaign in his support, arguing that he had tried to clean the country of corruption. The Keyhan daily reported that many in Mashad had been happy with the killings. Another report said a lawyer had volunteered to defend him. But the hard-liners were silent after it became clear that Mr. Hanai had taken many more prostitutes to his home and had intercourse with 13 victims before killing them. He was also found guilty of theft and forging papers that helped him introduce himself as a member of the so-called morality police working for the office for promotion of virtue and prevention of vice. He told the court that he had used the papers to harass people he thought were engaged in deviant acts -- unmarried couples in public together or women not properly covered. He said 80 more were on what he called his hit list.",2002,"Iran"

"376","THREATS AND RESPONSES: AFGHANISTAN; Rights Group Says Governor In Afghan West Abuses Power","MENA","Human Rights Watch, in a new report, accuses one of Afghanistan's most powerful regional governors of creating a ""virtual ministate"" in western Afghanistan where ""political intimidation, arrests, beatings and torture"" are widespread. The human rights group, in a report to be issued on Tuesday, also contends that the commander, Ismail Khan, who controls the western province of Herat, is reinstituting Taliban-era restrictions on dress for women and is banning Western movies and music. The group also says the United States and the United Nations are not doing enough to rein in Mr. Khan, who is accused of personally ordering political arrests and beatings, and it accuses the United Nations of turning a blind eye to the violations in the hope of maintaining stability. Mr. Khan, an ethnic Tajik who battled the Taliban, is also accused of overseeing the systematic harassment of ethnic Pashtuns, the country's largest ethnic group and a large source of support for the Taliban. ""One of the underlying purposes of this report is to challenge this conventional wisdom outside of Afghanistan that the situation is solved, that it's been liberated,"" John Sifton, co-author of the report, said in a telephone interview from New York. ""The truth that most people who have been outside of Kabul know is that the security situation in most of Afghanistan is deplorable,"" he said. ""Herat is just the worst example of it."" Mr. Khan could not be reached for comment today. In the past, he has denied abusing his authority. Fighting between the forces of Mr. Khan and a Pashtun commander based south of Herat, Amanullah Khan, has flared in recent weeks. On Sunday, aides to the Pashtun commander accused Ismail Khan's forces of firing a rocket into a market and killing two civilians. The account could not be confirmed. The report accuses Mr. Khan of violently suppressing all dissent to his rule in the Herat area. Challengers to his rule, it said, are subject to beating and torture. ""Herat has remained much as it was under the Taliban,"" the report says. ""A closed society in which there is no dissent, no criticism of the government, no independent newspapers, no freedom to hold open meetings, and no respect for the rule of law."" While recognizing that Mr. Khan has greatly increased access to education for women, it accuses him of placing severe social restrictions on men and women reminiscent of the Taliban. The report says the government instructs men and women to wear non-Western, Islamic clothes. Men are instructed not to shake hands with women. People caught committing what are considered vice crimes, like drinking alcohol, can be publicly denounced on television, or their heads can be shaved as punishment. The report calls on the United States, which has Special Forces soldiers stationed in the area, to pressure Mr. Khan to reform and to support aggressively an expansion of an international peacekeeping force now limited to Kabul. ""From the U.N. we want to see increased human rights monitoring,"" Mr. Sifton said.

The Iranian authorities, ending their silence on a difficult issue for an Islamic government, have acknowledged that prostitution has become widespread even though it is banned in Iran and violators face a lashing and hefty fines. For years, the existence of brothels was not acknowledged in the press, but newspapers have begun reporting on brothels that have been shut and on the arrest of prostitutes and pimps. In reporting the arrests, Entekhab quoted the commander of the police force in the northeastern province of Khorassan, Eskandar Momeni, as saying that the networks are involved in prostitution, money laundering, kidnapping and murder. The members of the groups were arrested after six months of surveillance in the city of Mashad. Some members have received death sentences, Mr. Momeni said. The paper also reported the arrest of a 74-year-old woman identified as Batool who had run a brothel in central Tehran since 1984. According to the paper, the woman told the police that she picked ambitious young women and promised to find them good jobs and rich husbands, or to send them to Europe. She kept them at her apartment in the middle-class neighborhood of Mirza-Shirazi and sold their sexual services.",2002,"Iran"
"378","Veiled and Worried in Baghdad","MENA","A single word is on the tight, pencil-lined lips of women here. You'll hear it spoken over lunch at a women's leadership conference in a restaurant off busy Al Nidal Street, in a shade-darkened beauty shop in upscale Mansour, in the ramshackle ghettos of Sadr City. The word is ""himaya,"" or security. With an intensity reminiscent of how they feared Saddam Hussein, women now fear the abduction, rape and murder that have become rampant here since his regime fell. Life for Iraqi women has been reduced to one need that must be met before anything else can happen. ""Under Saddam we could drive, we could walk down the street until two in the morning,"" a young designer told me as she bounced her 4-year-old daughter on her lap. ""Who would have thought the Americans could have made it worse for women? This is liberation?"" In their palace surrounded by armed soldiers, officials from the occupying forces talk about democracy. But in the same cool marble rooms, when one mentions the fears of the majority of Iraq's population, one can hear a representative of the Ministry of the Interior, which oversees the police, say, ""We don't do women."" What they don't seem to realize is that you can't do democracy if you don't do women. In Afghanistan, women threw off their burqas when American forces arrived. In Baghdad the veils have multiplied, and most women are hiding at home instead of working, studying or playing a role in reconstructing Iraq. Under Saddam Hussein, crimes against women -- or at least ones his son Uday, Iraq's vicious Caligula, did not commit -- were relatively rare (though solid statistics for such crimes don't exist). Last October, the regime opened the doors to the prisons. Kidnappers, rapists and murderers were allowed to blend back into society, but they were kept in check by the police state. When the Americans arrived and the police force disappeared, however, these old predators re-emerged alongside new ones. And in a country that essentially relies on rumor as its national news, word of sadistic abduction quickly began to spread. A young Iraqi woman I met represents the reality of these rumors, sitting in her darkened living room surrounded by female relatives. She leans forward to show the sutures running the length of her scalp. She and her fiance were carjacked by a gang of thieves in July, and when one tried to rape her she threw herself out of the speeding car. She says that was the last time she left the house. She hasn't heard a word from her fiance since he went to the police station to file a report, not about the attempted rape, but about his missing Toyota RAV-4. ""What's important isn't a woman's life here, but a nice car,"" she said with a blade-sharp laugh. Two sisters, 13 and 18, weren't as lucky. A neighbor -- a kidnapper and murderer who had been released in the general amnesty -- led a gang of heavily armed friends to their home one night a few weeks ago. The girls were beaten and raped. When the police finally arrived, the attackers fled with the 13-year-old. She was taken to an abandoned house and left there, blindfolded, for a couple of weeks before she was dropped at her door upon threat of death if anyone learned of what had happened. Now she hides out with her sister, young brother and mother in an abandoned office building in a seedy neighborhood. ""What do you expect?"" said the 18-year-old. ""They let out the criminals. They got rid of the law. Here we are."" Even these brutalized sisters are luckier than many women in Iraq. They have no adult male relatives, and thus are not at risk for the honor killings that claim the lives of many Muslim women here. Tribal custom demands that a designated male kill a female relative who has been raped, and the law allows only a maximum of three years in prison for such a killing, which Iraqis call ""washing the scandal."" ""We never investigate these cases anyway -- someone has to come and confess the killing, which they almost never do,"" said an investigator who looked into the case and then dismissed it because the sisters ""knew one of the men, so it must not be kidnapping."" This violence has made postwar Iraq a prison of fear for women. ""This issue of security is the immediate issue for women now -- this horrible time that was triggered the very first day of the invasion,"" said Yanar Mohammed, the founder of the Organization of Women's Freedom in Iraq. Ms. Mohammed organized a demonstration against the violence last month. She also sent a letter to the occupation administrator, Paul Bremer, demanding his attention. Weeks later, with no reply from Mr. Bremer, she shook her head in the shadowy light of her office, darkened by one of frequent blackouts here. ""We want to be able to talk about other issues, like the separation of mosque and state and the development of a civil law based on equality between men and women, but when women can't even leave their homes to discuss such things, our work is quite hard,"" she said. Baghdadi women were used to a cosmopolitan city in which doctorates, debating and dancing into the wee hours were ordinary parts of life. That Baghdad now seems as ancient as this country's Mesopotamian history. College students are staying home; lawyers are avoiding their offices. A formerly first-world capital has become a city where the women have largely vanished. To support their basic liberties will no doubt require the deeply complicated task of disentangling the threads of tribal, Islamic and civil law that have made the misogyny in each systemic. This is a matter of culture, not just policy. But to understand the culture of women in Iraq, coalition officials must venture beyond their razor-wired checkpoints and step down from their convoys of Land Cruisers so they can talk to the nation they occupy. On the streets and in the markets, they'll receive warm invitations to share enormous lunches in welcoming homes, as is the Iraqi custom. And there they'll hear this notion repeated frankly and frequently: without himaya for women, there will be no place for democracy to grow in Iraq.",2003,"Iraq"
"379","World; In Brief","MENA","the middle east TEHRAN -- Hundreds of Iranian women marked International Women's Day yesterday with a demonstration demanding equal social and political rights, a first in this country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. The women, wearing the head scarves and long coats required by law, and a small group of men held a rally at a central Tehran park. They were watched by a large contingent of police -- including about 400 women who in January became the first women to undergo training to be police officers since 1979. ""Half of the votes cast in favor of lawmakers were by women. How can you fail to recognize and support the rights of your wives, mothers and sisters? Why aren't women given top managerial or ministerial posts?"" activist Zohreh Arzani asked the gathering. In the crowd, some women held up signs against violence by men -- and against a U.S.-led war on Iraq. Associated Press MEXICO CITY -- President Vicente Fox criticized officials in Chihuahua state for not solving a string of brutal rapes and murders in the border town of Ciudad Juarez. Speaking at an event marking International Women's Day, Fox said investigators in Chihuahua, where Juarez is located, have not focused on solving the murders of dozens of women there. ""The killings of women in Ciudad Juarez are acts of violence that are unpardonable,"" Fox said. Police believe that the rape and slayings of more than 75 women in Juarez over the past decade may be connected. Last month, police discovered the bodies of three women in the desert near Juarez, a city of 1.3 million people across the border from El Paso, Tex. While it is unclear if a serial killer is involved, the crimes have been similar. Young women were kidnapped, usually on their way to work or school, raped, strangled and left in the desert outside Juarez. Last month, a court upheld the conviction of an Egyptian man for one of the first of the Juarez murders, which began in 1993. Associated Press LIMA, Peru -- Interpol reissued an international arrest warrant charging Peru's former president, Alberto Fujimori, with murder after receiving additional information from the government, officials said. Interpol suspended the original warrant Feb. 27 and gave Peruvian officials 14 days to provide evidence tying Fujimori to a paramilitary death squad and to demonstrate that the charges were not politically motivated. Prosecutors have accused Fujimori of authorizing the 1991 massacre of 15 people at a party in a poor Lima neighborhood, and the 1992 killings of nine university students and a professor. The former president has lived in Japan since fleeing a corruption scandal that toppled him in November 2000. He denies the charges. Associated Press BELGRADE -- Ratko Mladic, a Bosnian Serb general indicted on genocide charges stemming from Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, is not in Serbia and his whereabouts have not been known for a year, Serbia's interior minister said. Belgrade officials have denied allegations by Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, that Mladic was living in Serbia under army protection. Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic acknowledged that Mladic had received support in the past, but said he was no longer being protected. Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, the political leader of Bosnia's Serbs during the war, top the list of suspects still wanted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal. They have been indicted for genocide and other war crimes allegedly committed during the Bosnian war.

"380","Officer Testifies of Her Two Sexual Assaults in the Army","MENA","For the first time since the Department of Defense ordered a senior-level investigation into reports of sexual assaults against servicewomen stationed in the Central Command area surrounding Iraq, an officer who said she had been sexually abused told her story on Wednesday at an open hearing before Congress. The officer, Capt. Jennifer Machmer of the Army, testified at a crowded Capitol Hill hearing that she had faced two sexual assaults and a spoken sexual intimidation since going on active duty in September 2000. The most recent assault took place in Kuwait last March, Captain Machmer said, less than a month after she was deployed to Iraq. Because of the abuse and what Captain Machmer characterized as the military's repeatedly dismissive response to her complaints, ''my future has been put on hold and is still on hold,'' she told the panel, convened by the Congressional Women's Caucus. In addition to Captain Machmer's testimony, written statements from several other military women who had been sexually abused were submitted at the hearing. They included that of an Army Reserve major who said she had been raped last March by a fellow soldier in a women's latrine during a missile attack alert and a sergeant who said she had been raped in Afghanistan last spring by an officer serving in the forces of another country. ''If we do not address this problem here and now, I predict the Pentagon will witness a growing exodus of women in uniform, and growing problems in filling the critical positions they occupy,'' said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, co-chairwoman of the bipartisan caucus. The Congressional panel also heard testimony from people who are providing assistance to soldiers who have been sexually abused and from Anita K. Blair, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for personnel programs. ''Sexual assault is criminal conduct and will not be tolerated in the Department of Defense,'' Ms. Blair said. The Pentagon group investigating sexual abuse, which began work in mid-February, is to issue its findings by April 30. Over roughly the past 18 months there have been 112 reports of sexual misconduct by members of the United States military in Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Bahrain. Other recent reports of widespread abuse in the military, including reports of two dozen sexual assaults at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas in 2002, were referred to repeatedly at the hearing as examples of long-running, systematic problems in responding to the issue. Witnesses testified to the need for a number of services, including expanded mental health and trauma counseling and better medical care. A central theme was the need for confidentiality for victims. Advocates said that victims in the military, even more than civilian victims of assault, were reluctant to report abuse for fear of being isolated within their units and hindering their chances for advancement. Captain Machmer, who is being medically discharged as a result of her abuse, said the cumulative effect of the lack of support was a lack of trust in the military system. ''It's sad to say,'' she said in an interview after the hearing. ''But I trusted the Iraqis more than I trusted some of the people I worked with.''",2004,"Iraq"
"381","Iran Jails More Journalists and Blocks Web Sites","MENA","Iran has continued its crackdown on journalists, with two arrests in the past week, and has moved against pro-democracy Web sites, blocking hundreds of sites in recent months and making several arrests. Mahboubeh Abbas-Gholizadeh, the editor of the magazine Farzaneh and an advocate of expanded rights for women, was arrested Nov. 1 after she returned from London, where she had attended the European Social Forum. Fereshteh Ghazi, a journalist for the daily newspaper Etemad, who also writes about women's issues, was arrested four days earlier after she was summoned to court to answer questions, said her husband, Ahmad Begloo. Ms. Ghazi wrote a letter in support of a woman who had been sentenced to death for killing a senior security official whom the woman accused of trying to rape her. As part of its crackdown, the government has blocked hundreds of political sites and Web logs. Three major pro-democracy Web sites that support President Mohammad Khatami were blocked in August. A university in Orumieh in northwestern Iran shut down its Internet lab, contending that students had repeatedly browsed on indecent Web sites. The crackdown suggests that hard-liners are determined to curtail freedom in cyberspace. Many rights advocates had turned to the Internet after the judiciary shut down more than 100 pro-democracy newspapers and journals in recent years. The number of Internet users in Iran has soared in the last four years, to 4.8 million from 250,000. As many as 100,000 Web logs operate, and some of them are political. The move to block Web sites has the support of a senior cleric, Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi, who declared in September in the hard-line daily newspaper Kayhan that Web sites should be blocked if they ''insult sacred concepts of Islam, the Prophet and Imams,'' or ''publish harmful and deviated beliefs to promote atheism or promote sinister books.'' When the most recent wave of arrests began in September, authorities arrested the father of one Web technician, Sina Motallebi, who has taken refuge in the Netherlands. Mr. Motallebi had his own Web log and helped run one of the political Web sites. The father, Saeed Motalebi, was held for 11 days and then released. ''It seems that they do not want to deal with political figures who are behind the Internet sites and are willing to pay a price for what they are doing,'' said Alireza Alavitabar, a political scientist who is involved in the Emooz Web site. ''Instead they want to deprive the Web sites of their staff and the capability to run them,'' he said. Hanif Mazroui, the son of a former member of Parliament, Rajabali Mazroui, was arrested two months ago. He was a computer technician who worked for the daily Vaghayeh Etefaghieh, which was shut down. He has had no job since then. Omid Memarian, who was arrested Oct. 10, was a journalist and a well-known figure among private aid groups. He had his own Web log in both Persian and English. Mr. Memarian tried to attend a conference on Iranian civil society in New York before his arrest. He had obtained a visa, but in Frankfurt, American authorities refused to allow him to board his flight, saying that he was on a ''no-fly'' list, Human Rights Watch reported. He was arrested a few days after his return to Tehran. ''They want to find out how the Web sites are run, intimidate these young people and put an end to this medium,'' said Rajabali Mazroui, Hanif Mazroui's father. The judiciary is drafting a law that will define cybercrimes. The chief of the judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Shahroudi, has said the law will define the punishment for ''anyone who disseminates information aimed at disturbing the public mind through computer systems.'' It is not clear where the arrested journalists and technicians are being held. People who have spoken to their families have not said what the charges against them are. However, the judiciary spokesman, Jamal Karimirad, said last month that they would be tried on charges of ''acting against national security, disturbing the public mind and insulting sanctities.''",2004,"Iran"
"382","Turkey's Law Overhaul Overwhelms Courts and Citizens","MENA","In Judge Dursun Genel's snug little courtroom, the feuding couples shuttle in and out with stories of exhausted dreams and unhappy marriages. ''We'll never have peace,'' a young woman recently told the judge, agreeing with her estranged husband that the only solution to their problems was divorce. ''But who will look after you?'' Judge Genel asked. ''Under the law, you know, you have the right to make a financial claim,'' he added. ''I don't want anything from him,'' the woman responded. ''I just want you to make sure he doesn't threaten me anymore.'' So it goes in Turkey's newly established family courts where women now have equal rights in marriage, and courts are obligated to put restraining orders on bullying spouses. Family courts are just one product of the sweeping changes that have both transformed and swamped Turkey's legal system. An avalanche of new laws, geared to bring the nation closer to European Union norms, has altered the way the state treats everything from police brutality and juvenile delinquents, to commercial transactions and industrial pollution. ''We all have to work harder to stay abreast of the changes,'' said Judge Genel, the chief judge of a district family court in downtown Ankara and the host of a new television show that teaches the public about the new laws. ''But there have been excellent steps taken, and I think, from the reaction I've seen, that society was ready for them.'' The changes started three years ago but were accelerated under Prime Minister Recip Tayyip Erdogan, who has used a hefty parliamentary majority to rewrite hundreds of laws since taking office 21 months ago. In addition, a third of the articles in the Turkish Constitution have also been amended. The government's aim was to meet the eligibility criteria for starting membership talks with the European Union, which required stronger protection of free speech and human rights, and greater civilian control over the powerful military. As a result, Turkey abolished the death penalty and the feared state security court. It created intellectual property courts, consumer courts, juvenile courts and family courts. Treason was redefined, police powers limited, criminal penalties revised, trademark laws created and press laws revamped. In short, just about every field of law changed. Even the most experienced lawyers and judges have found themselves cramming like first-year law students and signing up for training seminars while cases pile up by the tens of thousands at courthouses. While complaints about the substance of the changes have been few, the velocity has prompted concern. ''Nowhere in the world have so many laws that effect you from the day you are born until the day you die, been passed in such a rush,'' said Sezgin Tanrikulu, president of the bar association in Diyarbakir, the provincial capital of Turkey's southeastern region. ''Unfortunately the civil code that regulates social and civil life was issued and put into practice in one month and the new penal code changes will come into effect in six months,'' he said. ''This is not enough time for either the judges or for society to adapt.'' In some courts, the sheer volume of new laws and procedures has overwhelmed the system's ability to absorb and understand the changes. The average processing time for a case at the Supreme Court increased to 283 days in 2003 from 53 days in 2000, according to the Ministry of Justice. Backlogs in the lower courts have increased similarly. ''We used to not even have to look at the codes and read the law books because we knew exactly what article or code was involved in a case,'' said Hikmet Uyar, chief judge of a district felony court in Ankara. ''Now the penalties have changed, the statute of limitations has changed and the article numbers have changed.'' More delays seem inevitable. A package changing more than 450 articles in the Turkish penal code flew through the Parliament last month and has been signed by the president. Once it takes effect next spring, the courts will have to re-examine each case to determine whether to apply the old law or the new law, because each defendant is entitled to be judged by whichever would be most beneficial. Judge Uyar said he could only hope to get through his caseload quickly. ''We want to finish what we've got as soon as possible and make a fresh start,'' he said. Much of the burden is administrative. This year, for example, the legal age for juvenile offenders was increased to 18 from 15, and specialized juvenile courts were created. That meant that thousands of pending cases involving youths of 16, 17 and 18 were moved out of the criminal courts, creating an immediate backlog for understaffed juvenile court judges. In Diyarbakir, some 4,000 cases are awaiting action in the new juvenile court, hearings are being put off for a year and some changes for the benefit of juvenile offenders have yet to take effect, Mr. Tanrikulu said. ''According to the law, these courts should have attending psychologists but, until now, I haven't come across any,'' he said. ''It's the same with the family courts. There is supposed to be a social worker assigned to each case, but there are hardly any available.'' Backpedaling on some changes has also caused confusion and delays for even the simplest suits. Some tasks of justices of the peace, like the assignment of a power of attorney, were transferred to the new family courts, but after a year of complaints and backlogs, the government reversed itself and sent those matters back to the justices of the peace. ''We felt like Ping-Pong balls thrown from one side to another,'' said Emre Kirkses, an Instanbul lawyer who handles divorce and family law cases. ''In the end, this conflict cost me one year on a case.'' Legal specialists have also predicted a tidal wave of appeals to the Supreme Court until police officers, prosecutors and judges familiarize themselves with the new definitions of crimes and new constitutional rights established for individuals. ''We've improved the laws on human rights, but not sufficiently,'' said Ibrahim O. Kaboglu, a constitutional law professor at Marmara University in Istanbul. ''The institutions have not yet adapted to the reforms.'' Dozens of people have been arrested and convicted in the past year for committing crimes that are no longer crimes under new Turkish human rights and civil liberties laws, Professor Kaboglu said. On the other hand, he said, Supreme Court judges have begun to issue decisions in cases involving freedom of expression that give precedence to international conventions on human rights over Turkish law. At the Supreme Court in Ankara, judges said they had been waiting decades to see many of the changes that Turkey had adopted in less than two years. Chief among the changes was the creation of a judicial branch to handle appeals from the lower courts, a change passed this month that is expected to trim the Supreme Court's caseload. ''We've been wishing for a court of appeals since 1946,'' Mehmet Handan Surlu, the court's deputy chief administrator, said. And there is general agreement that, for all the administrative and practical headaches they create, the wholesale changes in Turkish law were overdue. ''Sure there are troubles in the transition and the courts don't have enough personnel and we all have to get used to specialization in the legal system,'' said Hatice Kaynak, an Ankara lawyer who handles civil cases. ''The concept of the law has changed, from the idea of protecting the state to protection of the individual. But we're ready for it. The public was ready for it. And whatever problems we face getting used to the changes will be worth it.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2004,"Turkey"
"383","Unrelenting Attacks on Women in West Sudan Provoke an International Outcry","MENA","Even with the eyes of the world on this burned-out swath of western Sudan, threats of oil sanctions against the government and the trickle of African Union monitors into the countryside, one brutality has apparently continued undeterred: violence against Darfur's women. Women were insulted, beaten and raped as their families were chased from their homes at the height of the war in this region. They continue to be insulted, beaten and raped as they try to eke out a living far from home in the miserable camps of the displaced across Darfur. Judging from the accounts by victims themselves, as well as those of aid workers, human rights monitors and African Union military observers posted in Darfur, the victims are overwhelmingly women who belong to African communities here, and the perpetrators armed men who belong to Arab tribes. Since early 2003, the war in Darfur has pitted the Arab-led government of Sudan against rebels who are led by members of African tribes. Whether violence against women constitutes a war crime or whether it is part of a campaign of genocide remains unanswered. The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, has appointed a panel of experts to determine whether the violence in Darfur meets the international legal definition of genocide. If previous United Nations inquiries are any guide, this one is not likely to offer swift answers. Definitions aside, the more pressing question for people here, not to mention the credibility of the international community, is this: Can anything be done to stop it and then bring a measure of redress? ''Depending on the magnitude of it, it can constitute a crime against humanity,'' said Louise Arbour, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights. Investigators in Darfur have not yet determined the magnitude. Eight of them are in the region, spread across an area the size of France. For now the victims are left to the whim of local law enforcement, inwhich, it is apparent, there is little or no confidence. A recent inquiry by the Sudanese government turned up two cases of rape during the entire 18-month-long war in Darfur. Ms. Arbour, of Canada, rebuked the government, saying it was ''in denial.'' [On Oct. 23 the Sudanese agriculture minister, the government's chief negotiator in peace talks mediated by the African Union, described reports of widespread rape as ''a lot of fabrication.''] Violence against women in this conflict is not limited to rape. They are also verbally abused, threatened, robbed and beaten with whips meant for animals, the reports say. These days they are most vulnerable when they trek out to do women's work -- fetch firewood. Some of them bear gunshot wounds to the ankle, a sign that their attackers tried to keep them from fleeing. Others are marked as violated women. One woman in a refugee camp in eastern Chad lifted her veil not long ago to reveal a violent gash on her right cheek, and then she began weeping. She was sexually assaulted by five men, all in military garb, she said, during an attack on her hometown, Karnoi. A report by Amnesty International, the London-based rights group, says some women have been raped in front of their relatives. Fear and distrust in local law enforcement authorities runs so deep that the crimes are rarely reported to officials. When they are, victims and independent human rights observers say, little is done. No international legal mechanism has been set up. Military observers from the African Union cease-fire commission take reports of abuse, but all they can do is report the cases to the United Nations human rights agency. ''It's a little bit ambiguous,'' the United Nations official said. The evidence on the ground has been overwhelming. In January, during the height of the war, refugees fleeing into Chad said in interviews that attacks on their villages by the Sudanese military and the Arab militiamen whom they call janjaweed -- or marauders on horseback -- were frequently accompanied by sexual violence against women as they tried to flee. In August a refugee woman in a camp called Kounoungo in eastern Chad described vividly how two men on horses had hunted her down as she tried to run away from an attack on her village. One held a gun to her head while the other raped her. She was pregnant at the time. In the same camp, another woman held up the product of a violent assault: a baby boy with wavy hair, whom she called the son of a janjaweed. Sexual violence has been a tried-and-true way for armed men to sow terror among civilians in wartime, from the Balkans to Colombia and Congo to the genocide in Rwanda. The latter offers a particularly trenchant lesson for Sudan: Ten years later only a handful of allegations of rape have been investigated and prosecuted, according to a recent report by Human Rights Watch, the New York-based advocacy group. Here, even after women have fled attacks on their hometowns and villages, they have not found refuge. In early September investigators with the United Nations refugee agency tracked down 13 women who said they had been raped in a period of 10 days just beyond a displaced people's camp near Nyala, the state capital of Southern Darfur. In late September a 13-year-old girl was taken by donkey cart to the African Union cease-fire commission's office here with a chilling tale. Three men in uniform found her one afternoon as she was gathering firewood on the edge of town. They called her Tora Bora, a reference to the place in Afghanistan that once was a stronghold of Al Qaeda. The pro-government militias here use the name to refer to the rebels or anyone they deem to be their sympathizers. The men took turns raping her. African Union monitors found blood caked on the dry earth. Another woman, Hawa Ishak Mahmood, said she was on her way to seed someone else's farm on the outskirts of Kebkabiya in the summer when four men on camel and horseback stopped her in her tracks. They accused her of looking like a member of the Zaghawa tribe, which dominates the chief Darfur rebel group. Despite her denials, they beat her with the butt of their guns and wrestled her to the ground, she said. Then they took turns raping her. She no longer ventures out to work on anyone else's farm. She no longer collects firewood. Her children, ages 4 to 15, subsist on aid rations. ''Always, when people go out, they get beaten, they get raped,'' she said. Reports like this no longer surprise Seth Appiah-Mensah, the African Union sector commander here. ''It's very common, almost on a daily basis,'' he said. ''When you report it the authorities say it's not true. They always insist their soldiers are disciplined, they're under Shariah, they won't do this.'' The Shariah is the Islamic legal code. Who is committing the assaults remains unclear. Men in uniform here can be regular soldiers or members of pro-government militias. The lines are blurry. Besides, the African Union's mission is to monitor violations of the cease-fire between the government forces and the rebels. Rapes and other attacks against women are criminal offenses, and the organization has no law enforcement authority. In early October the police arrested a man who had gone to file a complaint with the African Union cease-fire commission about attacks on several women outside a displaced people's camp near El Fasher, the state capital of Northern Darfur. He was freed only through the intercession of a United Nations human rights investigator.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2004,"Sudan"
"384","Soldiers Facing Extended Tou ...","MENA","Army officials announced that thousands of active-duty and reserve soldiers who are nearing the end of their volunteer service commitments could be forced to serve an entire tour overseas if their units are chosen for deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. The order applies to all Army soldiers who are deployed in the future and means that many troops could face extended terms in the military after their formal contracts expire. Army officials said the move promotes cohesion by preventing Army divisions from being depleted before they go into battle. But military experts and lawmakers said the decision indicates that the Army is being stretched thin by multiple operations, with some calling the program a draft in disguise. All 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait and Qatar are serving under the same stop-loss conditions, but Army officials decided to announce a policy that alerts all troops for the future. The U.S. military intends to keep about 140,000 troops in Iraq through 2005. --  Josh White A federal judge in San Francisco struck down the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act Tuesday, ruling that the law jeopardizes other legal forms of abortion and threatens the health of women who end their pregnancies. U.S. District Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton concluded that the bill -- approved by wide margins in Congress last year and signed by President Bush -- was unconstitutional. Hamilton adopted most of the arguments put forward by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in finding that the measure was too vague, that it placed an unfair burden on women seeking certain kinds of abortions and that it did not do enough to protect women's health. The ban on the procedure that critics call ""partial birth abortion"" was already on hold temporarily as three courts heard legal challenges to it, but Hamilton's decision  prohibits the Justice Department from enforcing the law at any of Planned Parenthood's 900 clinics, which perform  half the nation's abortions. Planned Parenthood physicians who perform the procedure outside the organization's clinics also are protected. Doctors call the procedure ""intact dilation and extraction."" It requires partly delivering an intact fetus, typically during the second trimester, and puncturing the skull. It is unclear how many abortions are performed this way each year, but it is a small percentage. Many abortion providers argue that it is necessary because it can be lifesaving for some women and can protect the fertility of others. Opponents say that it ends the life of a being that had at least partly left its mother's body. --  Marc Kaufman Jose Padilla, the former Chicago gang member accused of planning to set off a radiological bomb in the United States, also plotted with some of al Qaeda's top operatives to blow up U.S. apartment buildings using natural gas and had sworn to carry out attacks when he was arrested two years ago, according to a release of classified interrogation information by the government. The summary of the case against Padilla, a U.S. citizen, also alleges that he met repeatedly with senior leaders of the al Qaeda terrorist network, including lieutenant Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, who took a keen interest in Padilla because he speaks English and held a valid U.S. passport. The allegations were unveiled as part of a defense of the government's treatment of Padilla, one of two U.S. citizens held for long stretches without charges in the United States as ""enemy combatants,"" without access to courts or lawyers. Their cases are pending before the Supreme Court. Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey Jr. said information gleaned from interrogations of Padilla shows that he was intent on killing innocents in the United States but ""would likely have ended up a free man"" if prosecuted in the criminal justice system, because his attorney would have advised him to tell authorities nothing. --  Dan Eggen Allegations of sexual assault in the U.S. Army have climbed steadily over the past five years, and the problem has been abetted by weak prevention efforts, slow investigations, inadequate field reporting and poor managerial oversight, according to internal Army data and a new report from an Army task force. The report, sparked by complaints from women's groups and female lawmakers about an apparent increase in reported assaults against U.S. servicewomen in Iraq and Afghanistan, states that the Army lacks ""an overarching policy"" for dealing with the problem, and that as a result it ""does not have a clear picture of the sexual assault issue."" The report also states that the Army lacks a ""comprehensive, progressive . . . program to train solders and leaders in the prevention of and response to sexual assault."" It said commanders within the region covered by the military's Central Command have not always reported sexual offenses to Army investigators, even when they took action against those involved. The Army's internal report echoes conclusions drawn in earlier, military-wide assessments. Data released separately by the Army Criminal Investigative Division, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by The Washington Post, made it clear that the number of sexual assault cases reported to the division increased each year from 1999 to 2003. --  R. Jeffrey Smith Deposed Haitian president  Jean-Bertrand Aristide arrived in South Africa on Monday for an open-ended stay close to one of his most steadfast international supporters, President Thabo Mbeki. Aristide's  exile has taken him across the Atlantic three times since leaving Haiti on Feb. 29 in the face of a rebel insurgency. A South African air force jet had flown him, his wife and their two young daughters from Jamaica, where they had been since March. South African officials called Aristide's exile here a ""temporary visit"" and said he had not been granted political asylum. Aristide was Haiti's first democratically elected president, but after seven months was removed in a military coup in 1991. He was restored to power three years later behind a U.S. invasion. In 2000, Aristide was elected president again, but opposition parties boycotted the vote as unfair. He has accused the United States of kidnapping him on Feb. 29 and forcing him to leave Haiti -- a charge U.S. officials deny. --  Craig Timberg",2004,"Iraq"
"385","Turks to Fight 'Honor Killings' of Women","MENA","In a nondescript building in a remote part of Istanbul, a young woman sat in front of a television on a recent day watching a chilling scene unfold. Panning across the dank walls of a cave, the camera stopped on a primitive drawing of a female form, then dissolved into a modern crime scene showing the chalk outline of a woman's body on a road. ''Every year, dozens of women fall victim,'' said the menacing voice of Atilla Olgac, an actor who plays the most fearsome character on Turkey's most popular television drama. ''Don't be a part of this shame; don't turn a blind eye to murders committed in the name of honor.'' The video is part of a nationwide campaign in Turkey to bring an end to so-called honor killings, in which a woman is killed by her husband or a male relative for behavior that is perceived as a slight to the dignity and respectability of her family. Rights organizations in Turkey and abroad have long denounced the practice as brutal and unfair to women; men who engage in the same activities are not held accountable. The 24-year-old woman was watching a preview of the television spot with officials from a women's shelter. She had been staying there for three days, the latest stop in a series of moves intended to keep her at a safe distance from a family that had decided she must return to her abusive husband, or die. Identified by shelter officials only as Nazan, she was married against her will when she was 15 and is now the mother of three children. Nazan said she fled her home after years of physical abuse and returned to her family declaring that she wanted a divorce. She begged to stay with her father for safety, but she said he considered her actions an affront to the family honor, and in an effort to force her back to her husband became abusive himself, leaving knife scars on her arms, legs and back. According to official records, 43 women in Turkey were victims of honor killings in 2004. But human rights activists say the number is far greater than that, with families reporting deaths as suicides or simply filing missing persons reports. ''Women's groups have been active in raising consciousness to prevent honor killings in the past few years but what they needed was a national campaign to support their work,'' said Nilufer Narli, a sociologist from Kadir Has University in Istanbul. She praised the campaign, which also includes billboards and fliers. ''Panels and conferences reach the elite, but you need television and movies to reach people in the street.'' The promotional television spots are scheduled to be broadcast on donated time on at least 10 television stations and hundreds of radio stations nationally starting this week. Honor killings are most common in the country's rural southeast, and among poorer and less educated Turks. In Diyarbakir, the largest city in the region, there are no shelters, despite efforts by local groups. ''Women are deeply hesitant to come to us,'' said Reyhan Yalcindag, deputy director of the Diyarbakir Human Rights Association. ''Even if they had the courage to file an official complaint, they still must go back to the home where they are targets, and live among the very people they have made charges against.'' ''There are only 14 shelters in Turkey, and none in the southeast,'' she said. ''These are not acceptable figures.'' The media campaign in Turkey is the first combined effort on the issue of honor killings involving both governmental and nongovernmental organizations, as well as clerics, and it is being financed by a grant from the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. At the same time Turkey, in hopes of being granted entry into the European Union, is working to bring its human rights standards in line with those of the West and to modernize its criminal justice system. A new penal code, ratified in September 2004, eliminated ''protection of family honor'' as a mitigating circumstance in murder trials and introduced heavier penalties for honor killing convictions. Another law recently passed by Parliament calls for the creation of a women's shelter in every large municipality in the country. But some critics say the changes are not enough. Despite the removal of the family honor provision, the commission making the legal changes left a loophole in the law, preserving ''unjust provocation'' as an available defense that could be invoked in honor killing cases. And while Ms. Yalcindag welcomed the potential addition of hundreds of new shelters, she said she was skeptical about the support they would get. ''Cities will be obliged to build more shelters, but it is the responsibility of the central government to ensure their security,'' she said, ''and there has been no promise made on that.''",2005,"Turkey"
"386","A Policy Of Rape","MENA","E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com  All countries have rapes, of course. But here in the refugee shantytowns of Darfur, the horrific stories that young women whisper are not of random criminality but of a systematic campaign of rape to terrorize civilians and drive them from ''Arab lands'' -- a policy of rape. One measure of the international community's hypocrisy is that the world is barely bothering to protest. More than two years after the genocide in Darfur began, the women of Kalma Camp -- a teeming squatter's camp of 110,000 people driven from their burned villages -- still face the risk of gang rape every single day as they go out looking for firewood. Nemat, a 21-year-old, told me that she left the camp with three friends to get firewood to cook with. In the early afternoon a group of men in uniforms caught and gang-raped her. ''They said, 'You are black people. We want to wipe you out,''' Nemat recalled. After the attack, Nemat was too injured to walk, but her relatives found her and carried her back to camp on a donkey. A neighbor, Toma, 34, said she heard similar comments from seven men in police uniforms who raped her. ''They said, 'We want to finish you people off,''' she recalled. Sometimes the women simply vanish. A young mother named Asha cried as she told how she and her four sisters were chased down by a Janjaweed militia; she escaped but all her sisters were caught. ''To this day, I don't know if they are alive or dead,'' she sobbed. Then she acknowledged that she had another reason for grief: a Janjaweed militia had also murdered her husband 23 days earlier. Gang rape is terrifying anywhere, but particularly so here. Women who are raped here are often ostracized for life, even forced to build their own huts and live by themselves. In addition, most girls in Darfur undergo an extreme form of genital cutting called infibulation that often ends with a midwife stitching the vagina shut with a thread made of wild thorns. This stitching and the scar tissue make sexual assault a particularly violent act, and the resulting injuries increase the risk of H.I.V. transmission. Sudan has refused to allow aid groups to bring into Darfur more rape kits that include medication that reduces the risk of infection from H.I.V. The government has also imprisoned rape victims who became pregnant, for adultery. Even those who simply seek medical help are harassed and humiliated. On March 26, a 17-year-old student named Hawa went to a French-run clinic in Kalma and reported that she had been raped. A French midwife examined her and confirmed that she was bleeding and had been raped. But an informer in the clinic alerted the police, who barged in and -- over the determined protests of two Frenchwomen -- carried Hawa off to a police hospital, where she was chained to a cot by one leg and one arm. A doctor there declared that she had not been raped after all, and Hawa was then imprisoned for a couple of days. The authorities are now proposing that she be charged with submitting false information. The attacks are sometimes purely about humiliation. Some women are raped with sticks that tear apart their insides, leaving them constantly trickling urine. One Sudanese woman working for a European aid organization was raped with a bayonet. Doctors Without Borders issued an excellent report in March noting that it alone treated almost 500 rapes in a four-and-a-half-month period. Sudan finally reacted to the report a few days ago -- by arresting an Englishman and a Dutchman working for Doctors Without Borders. Those women who spoke to me risked arrest and lifelong shame by telling their stories. Their courage should be an inspiration to us -- and above all, to President Bush -- to speak out. Mr. Bush finally let the word Darfur pass his lips on Wednesday, after 142 days of silence, but only during a photo op. Such silence amounts to acquiescence, for this policy of rape flourishes only because it is ignored. I'm still chilled by the matter-of-fact explanation I received as to why it is women who collect firewood, even though they're the ones who are raped. The reason is an indication of how utterly we are failing the people of Darfur, two years into the first genocide of the 21st century. ''It's simple,'' one woman here explained. ''When the men go out, they're killed. The women are only raped.''",2005,"Sudan"
"387","Behind Failed Abu Ghraib Plea, A Tangle of Bonds and Betrayals","MENA","In a military courtroom in Texas last week was a spectacle worthy of ''As the World Turns'': Pfc. Lynndie R. England, the defendant, holding her 7-month-old baby; the imprisoned father, Pvt. Charles A. Graner Jr., giving testimony that ruined what lawyers said was her best shot at leniency; and waiting outside, another defendant from the notorious abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, Megan M. Ambuhl, who had recently wed Private Graner -- a marriage Private England learned about only days before. To some, the grave misdeeds at Abu Ghraib, where the three soldiers worked for six months in 2003, have become a twisted symbol of the American military occupation of Iraq. But the scandal is also one rooted in the behavior of military reservists working at the prison, an environment that testimony has portrayed as more frat house than military prison, a place where inmates were routinely left naked and soldiers took pictures of one another simulating sex with fruit. The reservists' treatment of Iraqi prisoners and their entanglements with one another -- pieced together from documents, court testimony, e-mail and interviews -- have produced a dark soap opera, one whose episodes have continued to play out in the months since the scandal erupted, and culminated in the Texas courtroom last week. As with any soap opera, past episodes help explain the most recent. Private England, who is now waiting for charges to be filed against her again, and Private Graner began dating while they were training with their Army Reserve unit, the 372nd Military Police Company, based in Cresaptown, Md. A hell-raising young woman from West Virginia, Private England, now 22, was married at 19, on a whim, she told friends, and violated her parents' wishes when she joined the Reserve in high school to make money for college. Private Graner, 36, a Pennsylvania prison guard and a former marine, had rejoined the military in a burst of patriotism after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He was fresh from an ugly divorce in 2000. His ex-wife, Staci Morris, had taken out three protective orders against him, and after he was arrested for harassing her in 2001, Private Graner admitted that he had dragged her around by her hair. He introduced the two women, and Ms. Morris said she felt ''selfish relief'' that with someone new, her ex-husband would stop being obsessed with her. And she liked Private England, finding her quiet and adoring. ''If he was as charming with her as he is with most women at the beginning, I can understand it,'' Ms. Morris said. ''Charming, compliments, you name it. The things you would love to hear as a young woman.'' Just after the 372nd received orders to go to Iraq in February 2003, Private Graner, Private England and another soldier had a last party weekend in Virginia Beach. They drank heavily, and when their friend passed out, Private Graner and Private England took turns taking photographs of each other exposing themselves over his head. In Iraq, Private England was disciplined several times for sleeping with Private Graner, against military rules. She flouted warnings to stay on the wing where she worked as a clerk, and spent most of her nights in the cellblock where he worked the night shift. One night in October, he told her to pose for photographs holding a leash tied around the neck of a naked and crawling detainee. He e-mailed one home: ''Look what I made Lynndie do.'' The now infamous pictures of detainees masturbating, he said, were a birthday gift for her. Specialist Ambuhl, who has been discharged from the Army, was Private Graner's partner on the nightshift. If he and Private England were loud and bawdy -- they made a video of themselves having sex -- Ms. Ambuhl was soft-spoken and serious. Private England had joined the army to see the world; Ms. Ambuhl had already been on college study trips to Kenya and the Galapagos Islands. She had worked as a technician in a medical laboratory in Virginia, where she grew up, and like Private Graner, signed up to defend the nation after Sept. 11. She had been involved with another soldier in the unit. But by late December, she had ended that relationship and started one with Private Graner. In e-mail messages, the two dreamily recalled their nights stolen away in the crowded prison cells where the military police lived. ''I was missing u too,'' she wrote just after Christmas 2003. ''When I heard your voice coming up the stairs, it made me happy and kinda nervous too (good nervous).'' She reassured him that she would not get back together with her ex-boyfriend. But Private Graner had not completely cut off relations with Private England. On Jan. 2, 2004, he was caught sleeping in Private England's quarters and demoted. A few days later, Ms. Ambuhl e-mailed him again. ''I really do care about you,'' she wrote. ''It's just that part of me says I just got hurt from a relationship so don't put myself in the position to get hurt again.'' She fantasized about when they might be truly alone. ''Is it going to feel strange for just the two of us to be in a room together, with no chance of anyone walking in??'' she wrote a few days later. ''Just kidding, I can't wait.'' They talked about taking a leave together in February. But on Jan. 13, a soldier slipped investigators a disk with the graphic photographs of detainees. The investigation began the next day. Private Graner, quickly identified as the ringleader in the abuse, e-mailed his father in early March to discuss the accusations against him, then popped ''more good news:'' Private England was two months pregnant -- he spelled her name Lynndee -- and the pregnancy would most likely get them sent home from Iraq. They found out she was pregnant two days after breaking up. ''I stopped seeing her back in january but when all this garbage came out i started seeing her again,'' he wrote. ''chances are very good that it is my child....o well....daddy what did you bring home from the war????'' Ms. Ambuhl sent Private Graner e-mail in mid-March, after stumbling over old photos of them. ''it seems like a dream that we were ever together, if you could call it that.'' ''doin ok lately?'' she asked. ''U seem kinda distant.'' She let off a flash of exasperation with Private England. ''We never tried to exclude u and England,'' she wrote. ''You never wanted to go to chow or anything with us. And she does exactly what you do so you can't help that.'' Private England -- but not Private Graner -- was sent back to the United States because of the pregnancy. The Army moved Private Graner and Ms. Ambuhl, along with four other soldiers under investigation, to a tent apart from the rest of their unit. And they resumed their relationship. In April, Ms. Ambuhl e-mailed Private Graner an article headlined, ''Study Finds Frequent Sex Raises Cancer Risk.'' She added, ''We could have died last night.'' Privates England and Graner were no longer speaking when their son was born in October. She named him Carter Allan England. Ms. Ambuhl, who had by then pleaded guilty and been discharged, was subpoenaed to testify at Private Graner's trial at Fort Hood, Tex., in January. On the stand, prosecutors forced her to acknowledge the relationship, and accused her of lying to protect Private Graner. ''You don't want your friend to go to jail, do you?'' the lead prosecutor, Maj. Michael Holley, asked. ''No, sir,'' she said quietly. The two spent evenings together during the trial, and it was there that Private Graner proposed. He was convicted, sentenced to 10 years in a military prison and demoted from specialist to private. He had earlier been demoted from corporal. Ms. Ambuhl had gone back to work at the laboratory and was living with her parents. They accompanied her to Fort Hood for the wedding in April. Another man stood in for Private Graner, because he had begun serving his sentence and Ms. Ambuhl, as an admitted co-conspirator, is not allowed to see him. Private England heard about the wedding from her lawyers, who heard about it from a reporter the Friday before her trial was to begin. She had worked out a plea agreement that limited her time in prison to 30 months, and the jury could have given her less time. She planned to have her son live with her mother while she was in prison. Ms. Morris, Private Graner's ex-wife, had been subpoenaed to tell the jury that Private Graner was a bad influence, and over pizza in a hotel room, she befriended Private England. She told Private England that she regretted not warning her away from him at the beginning. ''She said, 'I guess I should be grateful for Megan?''' Ms. Morris recalled, ''And I said, 'Yeah, honey, you should be.''' The day before his testimony, Private Graner sent a note to reporters saying he regretted that ''Lynn'' had pleaded guilty and hoped her plea would get her a light sentence. Private England did not return any such affection. She leaned down to a courtroom artist sketching Mr. Graner: ''Don't forget the horns and goatee.'' Prosecutors advised defense lawyers against putting Private Graner on the stand, but they did it anyway. He testified that he had ordered Private England to remove a prisoner from a cell by a leash and that it had been a legitimate military exercise. This presented what seemed to be a contradiction -- a defendant pleading guilty but presenting a witness who testified that she was innocent. The military judge threw out her plea agreement and ordered that the court-martial process start over. ''It's nothing you did,'' the judge, Col. James L. Pohl, told her, ''It's what he did.'' Private England turned to Ms. Morris. ''Well, he screws everything up, doesn't he?'' Ms. Morris recalled Private England saying. ''I have to agree with you,'' Ms. Morris replied.

"388","Afghan Court Gives Editor 2-Year Term for Blasphemy","MENA","For the first time since the fall of the Taliban's Islamic government four years ago, a journalist has been convicted by a Kabul court under the country's blasphemy laws. Ali Mohaqiq Nasab, the editor of a monthly magazine for women called Women's Rights, was sentenced Saturday to two years in prison by the primary court in Kabul. The sentence will automatically go to appeal. The sentencing came after a strenuous battle between Kabul's conservative judges, led by members of the Supreme Court, and the liberal minister of information and culture, Sayed Makhdum Raheen, and revealed the strains between moderates and conservatives in the government of President Hamid Karzai. The prosecutor called for the death penalty, accusing the editor of apostasy, the abandonment of the faith, so the sentence appeared to have been a compromise. But it was a reminder that Afghanistan is still ruled by the Islamic legal code, Shariah, and that on issues of religion, conservatives are determined to enforce it. ''He could not provide a defense against the prosecutor and was found guilty of disrespecting Islamic law and was convicted to two years' imprisonment,'' said Ansarullah Maulavizada, chief of the public security tribunal in charge of the case. He contended that the magazine had run two articles in its latest issue about apostasy that violated the law by saying that while apostasy was taboo, it was not a crime under Islam. The authorities apparently ordered the issue removed from the newsstands. Mr. Raheen, the information and culture minister, said, however, that the court had bypassed a commission that was supposed to make recommendations in cases involving the news media and that the commission had found no blasphemy after examining the articles. Mr. Nasab, an Afghan who lived in Iran as a refugee, is an Islamic scholar and has degrees from more than one Islamic university there, Mr. Raheen said. He was arrested early this month and had won two postponements, one to find a lawyer and a second after he said he was ill. Mr. Nasab was shown on the Afghan commercial television channel, Tolo TV, at the trial. ''I do not accept the decision of the court,'' he said. He said he did not have a lawyer, although it was unclear whether he had chosen not to hire a lawyer or had not been able to find one. Mr. Maulavizada said Saturday that Mr. Nasab had been given enough time to prepare. Mr. Raheen had intervened in the case, recommending leniency. Under a new law governing the news media, put into effect under Mr. Karzai, the Commission for Investigating Media-Related Offenses has been charged with reviewing cases and advising the court. The commission's recommendations are not binding. ''This procedure was not legal at all -- to send someone to jail like that,'' Mr. Raheen said when Mr. Nasab was arrested. To emphasize that point, Mr. Raheen convened a meeting of the group on Wednesday. The commission interviewed Mr. Nasab and examined the two articles in question, one written by Mr. Nasab and one by an Iranian author. ''We found there was no blasphemy in the articles at all,'' Mr. Raheen said in an interview. ''We believe it was a media mistake, that the way he has explained things creates misunderstanding, so we gave him advice to be more careful so as not to create misunderstanding.'' He added that the court's anger had been directed against the article written by the Iranian, and that the commission had recommended the dismissal of Mr. Nasab as editor because his inexperience had led him to publish something that resulted in a misunderstanding. The commission includes two religious scholars, one of them a former Supreme Court judge; a member of the Academy of Sciences; two independent professional journalists; the journalism dean of Kabul University; and a member of the human rights commission, Mr. Raheen said. The case also has political overtones, since Mr. Nasab, a Shiite who had been an unsuccessful candidate in the parliamentary elections in September, had already come in conflict with senior, conservative Shiite clerics during the campaign, said Robert Kluyver, a representative of the Open Society Institute in Afghanistan. The magazine ''has been published for a number of years now, and although its articles are quite critical, they are well researched and not defamatory,'' Mr. Kluyver said in an e-mail message about the case. The religious issues addressed in the articles in question, and the scholarly way they were addressed, would be common in any other Islamic country, including Iran, he said. This is not the first time that accusations of blasphemy have been raised against editors and writers under Mr. Karzai's government, but until now Mr. Raheen has managed to discourage convictions by the conservative judges and members of the Supreme Court. ''I don't want any kind of damage to the freedom of speech,'' he said. ''I have been working very hard on this.'' He added, ''There are always some fanatics behind these things, and they take sides very quickly.'' Bomb Kills 2 in Afghanistan By The New York Times The attack came a day after insurgents killed six police officers in neighboring Helmand Province.

Shirin Ebadi, the lawyer who won the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize, has been threatened with arrest unless she closes the Center for Protecting Human Rights in Tehran. The center provides free legal representation to journalists, students and dissidents who face prosecution for peaceful assembly and criticizing the government.

He is free awaiting the outcome of his appeal, but there is no timetable for the decision. In the meantime, other prominent Iranians are languishing in prison, among them, Ali Akbar Mousavi Khoini, a former member of Parliament, who was arrested in June as he prepared to take part in the women's rights demonstration, and Ramin Jahanbegloo, one of Iran's best-known scholars, who was arbitrarily arrested in April. The European Union recently expressed alarm at the deterioration of human rights in Iran, as have Human Rights Watch and other nongovernmental organizations.

"391","Violence Against Palestinian Women Is Increasing, Study Says","MENA","Discriminatory laws, traditional practices and a severe shortage of emergency shelters combine to perpetuate violence against women by their family members and intimate partners in the Palestinian territories, according to a report to be issued on Tuesday by Human Rights Watch, a New York-based watchdog group. The report, ''A Question of Security: Violence against Palestinian Women and Girls,'' is based on extensive interviews over the last year with victims, police officers, social workers and officials of the Palestinian Authority. It says that while there is ''increasing recognition'' by the authorities of violence against women and girls, ''little action has been taken to seriously address these abuses.'' In fact, the report says, ''there is some evidence that the level of violence is getting worse while the remedies available to the victims are being further eroded.'' The report concedes that there is a significant lack of comprehensive data on the scale of violence, but it says that studies and statistics compiled by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics and women's groups, in many cases with help from abroad, ''record high levels of violence perpetrated by family members and intimate partners, aggravated during times of political violence.'' The offenses include domestic violence, rape, incest, child abuse and violent responses to so-called honor crimes, like adultery, that embarrass the clan, family or community. Laws dating from Jordanian and Egyptian administration in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, respectively, do not fully protect the rights of women, the report says. It notes, for example, that the laws provide reduced penalties to men who kill or harm female relatives who are accused of adultery, allow only male relatives to file incest charges on behalf of minors and absolve from criminal prosecution rapists who agree to marry their victims and remain married for three years. Rape laws distinguish between victims who are virgins and those who are not. Husbands may divorce wives at will with verbal notification while wives must obtain a judicial divorce, and can only initiate divorce on the basis of inflicted harm. The report also notes that given traditions of male authority and the enclosed nature of Palestinian communities, it is difficult for a female victim to seek redress or help with any guarantee of privacy. Those who complain to the police or the courts sometimes put themselves in more danger from an embarrassed family or clan. The system ''prioritizes the reputations of their families in the community over their own well-being and lives.'' Police officers, lacking a sophisticated system of legal options, and clan leaders, seeking to protect the reputation of the family, ''regularly 'mediate' and 'resolve' these cases, typically by returning the abused women to the 'care and protection' of her attacker, without ever referring the case to the courts or the woman to social or other services she might need,'' the report says. There are few women's shelters in the West Bank and none in Gaza; some women who need protection are put in women's prisons instead. The report notes that the Palestinian Authority is not a sovereign state, that the West Bank is under Israeli occupation and that the current fighting with Israel, which intensified in 2000, has only weakened the sway and reduced the resources of the Palestinian administration and the police. Still, the report urges the Palestinian Authority to change laws or enact new ones that criminalize family violence and to repeal provisions that perpetuate or condone such violence. It also urges that Palestinian officials survey the rate of violence against women, set up government-run hot lines and additional shelters, and provide guidelines and training to the police, health and social workers and the courts on how to handle crimes of abuse. The report also recommends a program of public education about the issue. Even more important, the agency urges the Palestinian Authority to pursue crimes against women and girls with ''effective investigations and prosecutions.'' The report also urges Israel to ease travel restrictions for judges, emergency workers and social service providers and to help Palestinian victims of abuse use shelters in Israel, including those used by Arab citizens of Israel. ''The problem is that no one sees this abuse as a crime,'' Lucy Mair, a researcher in the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch and a co-author of the report, said in an interview. ''It's seen as a family or social problem, and some behavior is not even criminalized.'' Farida Deif, a researcher in the Women's Rights Division, is the other co-author. The difficulties created by the current political situation, including travel restrictions and a cutoff of Western budget support and other funds to a Palestinian Authority led by Hamas, Ms. Mair noted, ''has led to the deterioration of existing institutions, erodes available remedies and makes the situation worse.''",2006,"Palestine"
"392","Silence and Fury in Cairo After Sexual Attacks on Women","MENA","There is fear in the shops along Talat Harb Street, and shame. It is not because of what the people who work here say they witnessed, the crowds of men groping women and pulling at their clothing. They fear the police returning, and they are shamed by their own silence. ''You know how our government works,'' said a store clerk, his voice pulled tight as he was guided by a co-worker back into a shop just as he had begun to recount the attacks he witnessed. Another clerk told a reporter, ''After you left the last time, state security came in and asked if we spoke to the press and demanded that we not speak to anyone.'' Recently, reports surfaced on Egyptian blogs, on television and in newspapers that groups of men had roamed the city streets during a holiday weekend and attacked young women -- actually chased them down in packs. There were accounts from witnesses and victims. But in the culture of Egypt's one-party state, the charges were received as a critique of the security services. There was no collective soul-searching, no government call for an investigation. There was, instead, adamant denial followed up by state-sponsored intimidation of potential witnesses. ''What those sick people described humiliates all Egyptians,'' said an official with the Interior Ministry, who asked not to be identified. ''You think Egyptians would see something like this happening and stand back and watch?'' There has been a lot of state-versus-the-people news coming from Egypt lately: the riot police storming a university to quell protests, and a member of Parliament thrown in jail for criticizing the military. There is an abiding sense that Egypt is out of order, and a frustration over systemic incompetence and negligence: a ferry disaster in which more than 1,000 people died, train crashes that killed hundreds, and fossilized government bureaucracies that seem incapable of responding. But the reaction to what happened during Id al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, has infused a deep sense of despair, deeper than usual, among the small segment of this society pressing for human rights, democracy, rule of law -- and improved status for women. ''There is nothing that works right,'' said Ahmed Fouad Negm, Egypt's most popular contemporary poet. ''Everything is corrupt and loose. And because the regime does not engage in political dialogue, it resorts to police repression. How can a state run on police?'' Talat Harb Street runs from the chaotic center of Cairo, Tahrir Square, which is an arterial roundabout where the Arab League of Nations has its headquarters and the Egyptian Museum displays the mummified remains of great pharaohs, like Ramses. Not long ago, when the holy month of Ramadan ended, crowds poured into the streets to celebrate. It was Easter on Fifth Avenue or New Year's Eve in Times Square. ''All of a sudden, these guys attacked us and came in between us and harassed us,'' a reveler told Al Ahram, the semi-official newspaper. ''They groped us in a way that is worse than anyone on the crowded street could imagine.'' There is still uncertainty over what exactly happened in the streets that day. What is certain, though, is that the police have been adamant that very little occurred, and that anyone who suggests otherwise is degrading Egypt's reputation. ''An individual called Wael Abbas who has an Internet site called The Egyptian Conscience is the one who invented this lie,'' reported a pro-government newspaper, Rose Al Youssef. Mr. Abbas is a young man who never goes anywhere without his digital cameras. He said he witnessed packs of young men hunting down young women, grabbing at their bodies. ''I saw two girls wearing those khaliji abaya,'' he said referring to the black flowing gowns favored by women in the Persian Gulf region. ''Guys surrounded them and pulled their clothes and veils and groped them.'' He posted his account on his Web site, then fled after his mother received a suspicious phone call from someone seeking his work address. He hid for two days, he said. His is hardly the only account. ''We saw a girl running and went into the Syrian restaurant called Madyafa,'' an unidentified witness said on a television show, ''El Ashera Masa'an.'' ''At this point someone had torn her shirt.'' On the satellite television show ''Al Qahira Al Youm,'' another witness said, ''They attacked girls walking, tore their clothes.'' He added: ''Shameless. And there were no police in the street.'' But the authorities say none of it happened. Minor disturbances, a few cases of harassment, they said, but nothing like what was reported. And the authorities were determined to silence those who sought to validate the more offensive accounts. ''What they wrote is not only an exaggeration; they are complete fabrications and they are trying to make a case and issue out of a non-issue,'' the Interior Ministry official said. ''Not one woman reported one case to any official body.'' Human rights groups say it is not surprising that women -- who did speak with the news media when they were promised anonymity -- would not file police reports. In this society, women are often blamed when they are the victims. Family dignity can be lost no matter who initiated the contact, no matter how violent it may be. The government understands that reality and has tried to use it at times to press people to cooperate. Last year, the police watched as thugs sexually assaulted women who protested a referendum to change the way the president is elected. Small groups of women have been trying to dodge the police to stage demonstrations, voicing their outrage not only over the gropings but also over the official response to the attacks. In the end, what is more troubling, the fear of being assaulted or the realization that the state does not care? ''This is not the first time this has happened, but the dangerous part is that it is the first time that it happened in such a collective way,'' said Nesreen Khaled, one of the demonstrators. ''Where are the police that are always there at the mosques? Where are the regular people to stop this from happening?''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2006,"Egypt"
"393","Iranian Women Are Arrested After Protests Outside Court","MENA","Iranian authorities arrested 33 women on Sunday after protests outside a court where five of them were being tried for leading a campaign to gain more legal rights for women, newspapers reported Monday. The five women were put on trial after they organized a demonstration for women's rights last June, the ILNA news agency reported. The agency said the women had been charged with endangering national security, agitating against the government and taking part in illegal gatherings. The arrests on Sunday were part of a crackdown against political activity by women and protests in general since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad' came to power in 2005. Authorities broke up last June's demonstration and arrested 70 people. The five organizers now on trial are Noushin Ahmadi Khorassani, Parvin Aradalan, Shahla Entesari, Soosan Tahmassebi and Fariba Davoudi Mohajer. The five, who have not been in custody, were arrested Sunday after they left the court. The daily newspaper Etemad Melli reported Monday that all 33 of the women were taken to the notorious Evin prison, which has the largest number of political prisoners in the country and where many prisoners say they have been tortured. Women have been pursuing two major campaigns since last year. One calls for authorities to change a law that permits stoning women to death if they are convicted of adultery. The other is an ambitious project to collect a million signatures for a petition that calls on authorities to change laws that discriminate against women. Iran's laws codify traditions that place little value on a woman's life and give only slight credence to women's opinions. For instance, a woman's testimony in court is worth half that of a man and, if a woman is killed, the compensation due her family is also half that required for a man's death. The laws also deny women equal rights in divorce, custody and inheritance. Both campaigns have been publicized worldwide and have drawn support from some well-known Iranians. Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner, has supported the campaigns. Zahra Eshraghi, the granddaughter of the founder of Iran's revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has signed the petition on discriminatory laws, the daily newspaper Kayhan wrote Monday. Human Rights Watch condemned the arrests and called for the women's immediate release. ''By targeting peaceful advocates, the government is demonstrating its intolerance for civil action,'' said Sarah Leah Whitson, the head of the group's Middle East and North Africa division. ''The authorities should listen to women's rights advocates and work with them to reform discriminatory laws, instead of persecuting them and perpetuating a system of discrimination.''",2007,"Iran"
"394","33 Activist Women Arrested in Tehran; Group Was Protesting Trial of 5 Others","MENA","Amnesty International yesterday demanded the swift and unconditional release of 33 prominent Iranian female activists arrested last weekend and jailed in Tehran's notorious high-security Evin prison. The women were arrested after peacefully protesting the trial of five other activists and grass-roots organizers against discrimination in the legal system. On the eve of the U.S. State Department's release of its annual human rights report and only days ahead of celebrations marking International Women's Day, Iran's best-known female activists were arrested early Sunday after they gathered with placards outside Tehran's Revolutionary Court. The five women whose trial they were protesting had held a public rally last June 12 to call for equal rights for women under Iran's penal laws, family code and blood money practices. At the time, club-wielding security officers rounded up 70 people. Under Iran's penal code, girls as young as 9 can be executed by hanging or stoning for adultery or what are referred to as morality crimes, while for boys the age limit is 15. If an Iranian girl dies in an accident, her family receives only half the compensation paid to the families of young male victims, according to traditional practices. ""Rather than arresting peaceful demonstrators, the Iranian authorities should be taking seriously women's demands for equality before the law and addressing discrimination against women wherever it exists in the Iranian legal system,"" said Irene Khan, Amnesty's secretary general, in a statement distributed by the group's Washington office. ""Practically the entire top layer of the women's movement in Iran, except for Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, who happens to be in Italy, is in jail,"" said Hadi Ghaemi of Human Rights Watch in New York. Under Iran's constitution, protesters have the right of assembly provided they are not carrying arms or defaming Islam. Yet Nusheen Ahmadi Khorasani, Shahla Entesari, Parvin Ardalan, Sussan Tammasebi and Fariba Davoodi Mohajer went on trial Sunday  on charges of acting against national security by participating in an illegal gathering. All but Davoodi Mohajer, who is visiting her daughter in Washington, appeared in court with their attorneys Sunday morning. When they emerged from the chambers to observe the commotion surrounding the arrests of the other women outside, the four defendants were rearrested, Ghaemi said in a telephone conversation from New York. In calling for gender equality, the protesters outside the court used a play on words similar to a slogan used by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to rally public support for nuclear energy. Rights activists have launched a campaign to collect a million Iranian signatures for a petition to end legalized discrimination against women. ""In Iran's prison system, there are eight women sentenced to death by stoning, while only two men have that sentence applied against sexual crimes or extramarital relations,"" Ghaemi said. If only one woman has witnessed a serious crime, the suspect goes free because her testimony is worth only half that of a man in court, he said. Although Iran, a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has promised not to execute anyone under 18, in August 2004 it publicly hanged 16-year-old Atefeh Sahaleh Rajabi in a public square in the city of Neka for ""crimes against chastity."" With 159 people executed by the state in 2004 , allegedly in accordance with Islamic law, Iran was second only to China in the number of death sentences it carried out that year. Amnesty has expressed concern that Ahmadinejad's  focus on a return to pure revolutionary values is making such executions more common.",2007,"Iran"
"395","Workers Allege Abuse by Kuwaiti Attache","MENA","Three Indian women who worked in the McLean home of a Kuwaiti military attache filed a lawsuit yesterday alleging that they were brought to the United States illegally and abused and exploited by the diplomat and his wife. One of the women, Mani Kumari Sabbithi, fled the family's home after the diplomat and his wife became angry over a mistake she made in preparing a meal for the couple's triplets, then 1  year old, the suit alleges. The wife, Maysaa Al Omar, pulled Sabbithi's hair and threatened to cut off her tongue, the suit alleges. The husband, Maj. Waleed Al Saleh, started screaming at Sabbithi and pushed her to the floor, knocking her out, the suit alleges. Soon after, Sabbithi went to the home of a sympathetic neighbor to whom the women had confided their problems, according to the lawsuit. A few months later, in January 2006, the other two workers, Joquina Quadros and Gila Sixtina Fernandes, fled as well, pretending they were going upstairs to do laundry but instead ducking out while their bosses were in the basement, the lawsuit said. Filed against the couple and the government of Kuwait, the lawsuit is the latest legal effort to curb the exploitation of foreign domestic workers, particularly by diplomats, whose immunity can make it difficult for authorities to investigate allegations of abuse, let alone act to halt such conduct. Jasem Albudaiwi, the first secretary of the Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington, said Kuwaiti officials learned of the allegations yesterday after media  inquiries about the lawsuit and were not able to immediately address the accusations. ""We're investigating all aspects,"" Albudaiwi said. ""We in the embassy don't tolerate any sort of abuse, especially of domestic helpers."" Al Saleh, who lives in the 7000 block of Elizabeth Drive, did not respond to a request made through an embassy spokeswoman for comment on the allegations against him and his wife. The lawsuit was filed at the federal courthouse in Washington by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union. It seeks an unspecified amount of damages for economic losses as well as mental and emotional anguish. Like many domestic workers who accompany expatriates on assignments to the United States, the women had been granted visas that are conditioned on their continued employment with the person who sponsored them  --  a condition that gives the employer tremendous leverage and that can pose a perilous obstacle to filing a complaint about mistreatment. In this case, the women came from impoverished backgrounds in rural India, the suit said. They alleged a range of abuse, threats and exploitation. At least two of the women were given contracts promising salaries of roughly $1,300 a month for eight-hour work days, the suit alleges.  Instead, they were forced to work up to 12 to 18 hours every day doing ""backbreaking work"" by caring for the couple's four children and performing numerous household chores, the suit said. They were paid just a few hundred dollars a month, according to the suit. In addition, the money was never given directly to them but instead was sent to relatives in the Middle East, the suit alleges. Now living in New York state, Fernandes, 39, Quadros, 40, and Sabbithi, 33, have been granted special temporary visas issued to victims of human trafficking, said a lawyer for the women, Claudia Flores of the ACLU. The ACLU's Women's Rights Project in New York and the law firm Dechert LLP drafted the suit, which alleges human trafficking, forced labor, involuntary servitude, false imprisonment, assault, battery and other violations of the law. Flores said arguments of diplomatic immunity can be overcome if the case involves a commercial relationship outside the scope of official responsibilities. In those instances, she said, the diplomat's conduct might not be covered by the Vienna Convention. The exploitation of foreign domestic workers, particularly from South Asia, is a pervasive problem in Kuwait, the lawsuit claims, citing reports by the U.S. State Department and the advocacy group Human Rights Watch.",2007,"Kuwait"
"396","Voice for Abused Women Upsets Dubai Patriarchy","MENA","For years, Sharla Musabih has fought a lonely battle to protect battered wives and victims of human trafficking here. She founded the Emirates' first women's shelter here and she became a familiar figure at police stations, relentlessly hounding officers to be tougher on abusive husbands. She has also earned many enemies.  Emiratis do not often take kindly to rights advocates drawing attention to the dark side of their fast-growing city-state on the Persian Gulf, better known for its gleaming office towers and artificial islands. Still, no one was quite prepared for the stories that started appearing in Dubai newspapers  this month.  Suddenly, unidentified  female victims were coming forward to say that ''Mama Sharla'' herself had abused them, forced them to work as servants and sold their stories to foreign journalists for thousands of dollars, pocketing the proceeds. She even sold one woman's baby, the articles said, hinting at criminal investigations. To Ms. Musabih and her supporters, the accusations, which appear to be baseless, are the latest chapter in a long campaign of threats and defamation that began with angry husbands and has grown to include prominent clerics, and even the directors of a new government-financed women's shelter, who, she says, would like to silence her. The ferocity of the dispute is unusual for Dubai, and  underscores a  major challenge facing this proudly apolitical business capital. The city's few rights advocates have always been quietly shunted aside. But as the conservative Muslim ethos of Dubai's native Arab minority rubs  against the varied perspectives of a much larger foreign population, debates about how to approach taboo subjects like domestic violence and the city's prevalent prostitution are getting louder. Battling Tradition Ms. Musabih, 47,  a boisterous American transplant who was born and raised on Bainbridge Island, Wash., argues that confrontation is essential in fighting the patriarchal Arab traditions that allow men to beat their wives with impunity. She and her supporters also say the Emirates have not acknowledged the severity of their problem with human trafficking, the brutal business in which foreign women are lured here with promises of jobs and then forced into prostitution or servitude. Last year the United States State Department placed the Emirates and 31 other countries on a watch list for failing to effectively combat the illegal trade. ''When a woman has three broken bones in her back, and the police don't take it seriously, yes, I get angry,'' Ms. Musabih said. Others say Ms. Musabih's aggressive approach -- which includes appeals to foreign news media as well as tough, face-to-face lobbying -- is inappropriate in the Arab world, and has needlessly fueled the backlash she now faces. That assertiveness may also have made it easier to dismiss her as an outsider. Although she has lived here for 24 years, converted to Islam, is an Emirati citizen, wears a veil and has raised six children here with her Emirati husband, Ms. Musabih is still unmistakably American, from her moralistic  zeal  to her habit of calling the women in her shelter ''darlin'.'' ''I have told her sometimes I think she is wrong, she goes too far,'' said Lt. Gen. Dahi al-Khalfan, the chief of the Dubai Police, who has supported Ms. Musabih in the past but now tends to criticize her work as divisive. ''There is a case between husband and wife;  let the court decide! Leave it.'' Safety and a Ticket Home Ms. Musabih dates her work as an advocate from  1991, when she started tracking domestic violence cases and offering women shelter in her home in Dubai. In 2001, she rented a two-story house in the Jumeira district and opened a shelter for abused women and their children, naming it City of Hope. On a recent afternoon, children's toys littered the floors in the shelter's sunlit living room, and several women snacked in the kitchen, while others sprawled on couches watching television upstairs. Although Ms. Musabih has had some dedicated assistants over the years, it is basically a one-woman show; she deals with everything from belligerent former husbands to buying plane tickets, sometimes with her own money, for foreign women to return to their home countries. ''I've repatriated 400 victims in the past six months,'' said Ms. Musabih, a fast-talking, energetic figure who presides over the shelter like an overworked mother. Establishing the shelter was unusual enough in the Arab world, where going outside the family to resolve domestic conflicts has little basis in law or custom. Ms. Musabih's personal advocacy made her work even more startling. She would counsel women to leave their husbands if they were being beaten, and help represent them in  courts or foreign consulates. She would also march into police stations and yell at officers if she felt they were not protecting women in danger. In the Arab world it is virtually unheard of for a woman to behave this way toward a man, and the officers sometimes felt they had been publicly humiliated. Some women who have spent time in the shelter say this tough approach is necessary. The police in Dubai ''won't do anything to protect you while you're legally married,'' said one former resident of the shelter, who declined to give her name because she still fears repercussions,  from her husband and from others who oppose Ms. Musabih. After her husband beat her repeatedly, the woman said, she appealed to the police, who made her husband sign a promise that he would not do it again. He violated the pledge again and again, she said, but the police did nothing, even after he broke into another house where she was seeking refuge and raped her. ''The police told me, 'We can't do anything, he's your husband,' '' she said. But Ms. Musabih's approach clearly shocked and angered many, and not just the husbands  whose wives found shelter. A prominent cleric, Ahmed al-Kobeissi, recently gave interviews to Dubai newspapers in which he said Ms. Musabih's work ''goes against the traditions of Emirati people'' because she ''instigates wives against their husbands.'' Mr. Kobeissi also voiced indignation at Ms. Musabih's suggestion that Emirati men are among the clients of Dubai's many prostitutes. Ms. Musabih's work took on a higher public profile when she joined a crusade against the practice of using children, some as young as 4, as camel jockeys, once common in the Persian Gulf. Her advocacy led to a number of television and newspaper reports about the horrific abuses practiced on young jockeys, and appears to have helped lead to a ban on the practice in the Emirates in 2005. Ms. Musabih is full of praise for the Emirati government's response on this issue, and says it responded quickly and effectively to her appeals to change the laws. But her highly public approach to the problem is said to have angered some influential Emiratis, who felt she had embarrassed the leadership instead of allowing the matter to be settled quietly. In the early spring of 2007, government officials approached Ms. Musabih about plans for a new state-sanctioned women's shelter, apparently intended to replace hers. At first she welcomed the idea, because her shelter was often crowded and she was struggling to manage financially. They praised her pioneering work and said she could help direct the new shelter as a board member. As the project evolved, it became clear that the government's approach was vastly different from Ms. Musabih's. It hired a director with a background in management and a more subdued style. On the grounds of an old rehabilitation center 20 minutes from Dubai with high fences and guards, the new shelter, known as the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children, resembles an American low-security prison. Ahmed al-Mansouri, the chairman of the foundation's board, says there was a need for a more organized approach and a shelter that, unlike Ms. Musabih's, was licensed by the government. He says she was not making adequate progress on the legal cases of the women in her shelter, a claim she vehemently disputes. He also describes the familial chaos of the City of Hope shelter as a ''horrible way of living.'' Certainly, the new shelter is more spacious, and has better access to schooling for the women's  children. Feeling of Betrayal In October, buses arrived at City of Hope and they moved  35 women to the foundation shelter. But Ms. Musabih soon  began to feel  that the directors of the new shelter had betrayed her and were negligent with the women in some cases, a claim the foundation denies. She says the foundation was more interested in getting foreign women back to their home countries with a minimum of embarrassment, than in investigating wrongs that had been done to them and preventing those wrongs from recurring. If the new shelter was meant to replace Ms. Musabih and quiet her down, it became clear over the following months that it would not work. City of Hope continued to take in new women, and as Ms. Musabih kept criticizing the Dubai Foundation's approach, her relations with its directors became steadily nastier. When one of the women who was moved to the foundation tried to commit suicide in December, Ms. Musabih accused its staff of negligence. After a heated exchange, the foundation's director, Afra al-Basti, sued Ms. Musabih for slander. It was then that the scandalous articles  about Ms. Musabih began appearing in Dubai newspapers. The sources for those articles appear to have been women at the foundation shelter who, like some of their counterparts at the City of Hope, are vulnerable or unstable, and have been drawn into the dispute  boiling  around them. Some speak no English or Arabic, and are easily manipulated. How exactly they came to spread false stories about Ms. Musabih's selling babies or taking thousands of dollars from foreign journalists is still not clear. Ms. Musabih, speaking by phone from Ethiopia, where she is setting up a shelter, said she felt betrayed. ''I never thought it would go this far,'' she said. ''These people think I'm an enemy of the state and that I need to be controlled.'' But even some of her supporters wonder whether Ms. Musabih, for all her pioneering accomplishments, could not have avoided all the ugliness if she had been willing to do things more quietly. ''With Sharla, it is 'No, I am right,' and she always deals with people straight on,'' said Awatif Badreddine,  a supervisor at City of Hope. ''But I tell her you have to deal with people differently here. The Arabs don't like this. Sometimes you have to go around to get what you want.''",2008,"UAE"
"397","Former Israeli President Drops Plea Deal","MENA","In a dramatic courtroom twist, Moshe Katsav, the former president of Israel, backed out of a plea agreement on Tuesday that required him to admit to having committed sexual offenses against female employees. The decision could lead to the spectacle of a long, sordid trial and possibly the reinstatement of rape charges that had been dropped in the plea bargain. The court session was supposed to start proceedings on the deal that had been reached with the state prosecutor nine months ago. But Mr. Katsav told the court he had decided to go to trial to clear his name instead. ''I wish to fight for my innocence,'' Mr. Katsav told a three-judge panel at the Jerusalem Magistrates Court, as his wife, Gila, and other family members sat on the bench by his side. ''I want to put an end to this persecution.'' The announcement stunned many Israelis. In a statement after the court hearing, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz expressed amazement at the conduct of Mr. Katsav's lawyers, who had told the prosecutor's office of the decision to renege on the deal only an hour before the hearing. ''In any event, one must assume that the implications of this move are clear to Moshe Katsav,'' he said. There had been fierce public criticism of the deal, in which possible rape charges against the former president were dropped in exchange for an admission of guilt for lesser offenses, including committing an indecent act, sexual harassment of two employees and harassing a witness. For months, Mr. Katsav's lawyers and the state prosecutors defended the deal as the High Court of Justice considered six public petitions for its annulment. In late February, the High Court upheld the agreement, with the court's five-judge panel split 3 to 2. Chief Justice Dorit Beinisch, in the minority, argued that the deal was seriously flawed. According to its terms, Mr. Katsav was to serve no jail time, but receive a one-year suspended sentence and pay several thousand dollars in compensation to two women. He was also required to resign from the presidency last June, two weeks before his term was to expire. After Mr. Katsav's announcement, the prosecution and the court agreed to cancel the indictment that had been issued in the context of the plea agreement. Mr. Mazuz will reconsider the evidence against Mr. Katsav before filing a fresh indictment, with or without rape charges. The prosecutors had previously argued that problems of evidence led them to a plea agreement in the first place. Mr. Katsav has always maintained his innocence. Last June, his lawyers suggested that he agreed to admit to the lesser offenses only to spare his family the ordeal of a trial. In court on Tuesday, Mr. Katsav said that he knew he was ''choosing the hard way,'' and that he was fully aware of the consequences. Leaving the courtroom, one of his lawyers,  Avigdor Feldman, said his client could not ''admit to charges he did not commit.'' Mr. Feldman said that he would continue to represent Mr. Katsav, and that the former president had made his decision in consultation with his lawyers,  who ''supported it.'' Zecharia Schenkolewski, a lawyer for a woman identified in the plea agreement only by the initial L., said that if necessary the woman would testify against Mr. Katsav in court. The woman, who worked in the president's office, has accused Mr. Katsav of sexual misconduct and witness harassment. It was Mr. Katsav's first appearance in court, nearly two years after the allegations against him started coming out. In the street outside the court, dozens of women and a few men demonstrated in white T-shirts printed with the slogan ''We are all A.,'' referring to the woman who first accused Mr. Katsav of rape, whose case was dropped in the plea deal. There were shouts of ''rapist'' from the protesters as Mr. Katsav made his way into the small, packed courtroom, smiling wanly. He was holding hands with his wife, who was visibly upset. Many had expected Mr. Katsav's lawyers to seek some kind of delay. The hearing had already been postponed for two weeks, with the defense lawyers contending that they had not received some of the investigation materials from the prosecutor's office. Representatives of women's groups expressed satisfaction that Mr. Katsav would go to trial, but said they had no way of knowing whether it was another stalling tactic by Mr. Katsav and his lawyers. ''We were against the plea arrangement to begin with,'' said Miriam Schler, director of the Rape Crisis Center in Tel Aviv, who was among the protesters outside the courthouse. ''We hope there can now be a fair trial.'' She said the ordeal that the women who filed the complaints against Mr. Katsav had gone through had already deterred many young women from complaining to the authorities about sexual crimes. Mr. Katsav would be the first former head of state to go on trial in Israel. After resigning from the presidency, a mainly ceremonial post, he was succeeded by the elder statesman Shimon Peres. Legal commentators said Mr. Katsav was taking a big risk by asking to go to trial. After the court hearing, one of the women's lawyers said Mr. Katsav was ''fighting for his life.''",2008,"Israel"
"398","A Young Life Hangs in the Balance in Afghanistan's Cultural War; Death Ordered for Challenging Islam","MENA","While trolling the Internet last October, Afghan journalism student Sayed Perwiz Kambakhsh came across some articles that questioned the limits of women's rights under Islam. According to Afghan prosecutors, he downloaded the articles and circulated them on campus. In the West, it would have been an innocent act. In Afghanistan, it has just earned him a death sentence. Now inside a provincial Afghan prison cell, Kambakhsh, 23, sits at the center of a cultural war between two powerful forces that have clashed repeatedly in the six years since the Taliban's extreme Islamic rule ended in Afghanistan. One is the sway of conservative Islamic leadership and entrenched values that traditionally have dictated every aspect of Afghan religious life. The other is the fast-growing, Internet-driven influence of Western ideas that encourage young Afghan students and professionals to challenge everything, even their faith. As many older, devout Afghans view it, Kambakhsh committed an unforgivable sin against Islam by circulating the articles, one of which questioned why Muslim men can have more than one spouse at a time but women can't. They support the court's harsh ruling, partly as punishment and partly as a deterrent to such behavior and thinking. ""We believe in free speech, but Islam is more important to us than anything. When someone insults our religious traditions, he is not a journalist, he is a traitor,"" said Enayatullah Balegh, the imam of a large mosque in Kabul, the Afghan capital. Kambakhsh's actions, he said, were tantamount to ""insulting 30 million Afghan Muslims. The court has given the right punishment."" As many younger, educated Afghans view it, Kambakhsh was engaging in the kind of intellectual debate that is inevitably entering Afghan society, healthy for its democratic development and legally protected by its constitution. They view the court's action as unjust, cruel and motivated by political pressure to quash investigative journalism. ""If it is illegal to read and write something, then this is not a democracy; it's a dictatorship,"" said Rahimullah Samander, president of the Afghan Independent Journalists' Association. He said the ruling, handed down last month by a panel of judges in the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif, was symptomatic of an older generation of Afghan religious and militia leaders who view themselves as a bulwark of Islamic tradition. ""They want to show they still have power,"" he said. Afghan officials and analysts said this week that Kambakhsh is highly unlikely to be put to death. The lower-court decision has already been appealed and could eventually reach the Supreme Court, which is headed by a respected, Western-educated judge. Moreover, the final decision on any execution rests with President Hamid Karzai, who generally opposes the death penalty and has found ways to circumvent it in several previous capital cases. Aside from the religious issues involved, several irregularities have been discovered in the handling of the case by police and the court. Kambakhsh, who did not have a lawyer or a public trial, was hauled from his cell after court hours and privately informed of his sentence by a panel of judges. It is also unclear whether he apologized to the authorities -- which is grounds for leniency under sharia, or Islamic law -- or was forced to confess to a crime he did not commit. ""There will be several opportunities to review the case very carefully, by very serious experts,"" said Rashid Rasheed, a spokesman for the Supreme Court. ""Sharia law is very broad-minded and forgiving. If this accused gentleman has apologized and he is not stubborn, I am hopeful that things will not go harshly and that this will be seen as a fault rather than a criminal offense."" Nevertheless, the case has provoked a domestic and international firestorm, once again squeezing Karzai's government between the demands of Western democracies -- which helped free Afghanistan from harsh Islamic rule in late 2001 -- and the demands of a largely conservative Muslim society that is deeply resentful of foreign interference and highly sensitive to any slight against its religion. The Kambakhsh case is only the latest in a series of incidents in which journalists and publishers have come under legal and religious pressure for disseminating material or ideas deemed anti-Islamic. Late last year, a government press aide, Ghaus Zalmai, was arrested and nearly lynched for circulating a translation of the Koran in Afghan Dari that senior religious scholars had not approved. He is still in prison awaiting trial. This time, deluged with protests from international human rights groups and governments that provide the bulk of aid and security for his country, Karzai has tried to find a diplomatic middle ground. Last week, asked about Kambakhsh during a one-day visit here by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, he carefully promised that ""justice will be done, in the right way."" At home, the controversy has brought out competing public demands from organized groups on both sides of the culture war. An influential council of religious scholars has pressed for Kambakhsh's execution and also for the return of harsh public punishments once carried out by Taliban authorities. Its leaders say that they fear young Afghans will fall prey to the libertine influence of the West and that the international community's aid is not worth the undermining of Islam. ""If Afghanistan is a free country, the foreigners should not interfere. If they support this boy, people will start to hate them,"" said Balegh, the imam. ""We appreciate the help of foreign troops, but if the Americans and the British are coming here and sending their money to use against Islam, we don't want them. Either we have our own laws and traditions or we are an occupied country."" At the same time, newly emboldened civic organizations have held unprecedented street protests defending Kambakhsh in Kabul and Jalalabad, while national press associations appear to have played a careful role in persuading authorities to take a closer look at the case. Nevertheless, these groups say they feel under increasing threat from the combined forces of conservative religious and armed political groups that still command enormous power, especially in rural provinces where Karzai's government is weak. They assert that the prosecution of Kambakhsh was intended to intimidate his older brother, an established journalist in Mazar-e Sharif who has investigated corruption and abuses by former militia leaders. ""They are putting pressure, they are trying to censor the press. As long as we have such contradictions in our own laws and constitution, it will continue,"" said Samander, president of the journalists' association. He noted that police searching Kambakhsh's home had confiscated writings on human rights and modern thought, including a classic study of religion by Will Durant. ""I have that book here in my office,"" he said with a wry grimace.",2008,"Afghanistan"
"399","Iranian Activists Criticize New Restrictions on Web Sites","MENA","Iranian bloggers and activists on Tuesday condemned a move by a government panel to block access to several Web sites related to women's issues and human rights. ""It's like a big attack,"" said Parvin Ardalan, who works for http://www.change4equality.net, a Tehran-based feminist Web site affected by the new restrictions. ""Now, most sites related to women's and human rights issues have been blocked in one day,"" she said. Ardalan's site is part of a campaign to collect 1 million signatures aimed at pressuring the government to change what activists call discriminatory laws against women. ""The authorities want to silence us,"" she said. Web sites maintained by opposition groups, dissidents and even some supporters of the government have been blocked in the past. Iran also bars access to thousands of Web sites that show pornography. The Ministry of Islamic Guidance and Culture's supervisory board for the media notified Iranian Internet service providers Saturday about the new restrictions, which affected dozens of sites, according to a report Tuesday in Ettemaad-e Melli, a newspaper in Tehran that is often critical of the government. The supervisory board answers to the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, which determines the country's educational, scientific, cultural and social objectives. The 36-member council sets parameters for what is allowed on the Iranian Internet, but the board decides which sites should be blocked. It is unclear who sits on the board, although its members are thought to include representatives of the judiciary, the intelligence service and other government agencies. The board has in the past effectively banned Web sites supportive of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Access to a blog by the wife of government spokesman Ghollam-Hossein Elham was restricted this year. Elham said that access was blocked because of his wife's critical articles about Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and powerful anti-Ahmadinejad politician. ""The limits of the filtering are pornography and anti-revolutionary sites. This is illegal censorship,"" Elham said to the Khorasan newspaper in April. The blog is now accessible in Iran, but some other sites supportive of the government remain blocked. ""Newspaper censorship, social oppression and filtering are not logical unless you look at them as sub-parts of overall oppression,"" said Asieh Amini, a journalist and activist in Tehran. Her blog, http://varesh.blogfa.com, has been blocked since Saturday. From 1999 to 2005, Iran's judiciary closed dozens of newly founded newspapers critical of the government, prompting many journalists to move to the Web. In 2003, Iranian authorities started restricting access to Web sites, a technique which can be bypassed by filter breakers or other tools to avoid digital censorship. These programs are slow, and filtered Web sites lose many readers. According to Iranian blogging services, last year there were more than 700,000 blogs in Farsi, many of which are written from abroad. ""It makes one really depressed to see his or her site being filtered, but it also shows that the authorities are afraid,"" said Jadi Mirmirani, a human rights activist. ""It means: we do not tolerate any alternative news sources or any new ideas.""",2008,"Iran"
"400","Sudan Court Fines Woman For Wearing Trousers","MENA","A Sudanese woman who wore pants in public was fined the equivalent of $200 but spared a whipping on Monday when a court found her guilty of violating Sudan's decency laws. The woman, Lubna Hussein, an outspoken journalist who had recently worked for the United Nations, faced up to 40 lashes in the case, which has generated considerable interest both inside and outside Sudan. Mrs. Hussein vowed to appeal the sentence and even walked into the court in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, wearing the same pair of loose-fitting green slacks that she had been arrested in. Manal Awad Khogali, one of her lawyers, said the judge hearing the case had called only police witnesses to testify and refused to allow Mrs. Hussein -- who had pledged to use her trial to bring attention to women's rights in Sudan -- to defend herself. ''He didn't give us a chance,'' Mrs. Manal said. After the trial was over, Mrs. Hussein, a 34-year-old widow, seemed defiant as ever. ''I will not pay a penny,'' she told The Associated Press. The judge had threatened to jail her for one month if she did not pay the fine. But according to The A.P., Mrs. Hussein said flatly: ''I would spend a month in jail. It is a chance to explore the conditions in jail.'' On Monday night, after refusing her lawyers' advice to pay, Mrs. Hussein was whisked off to jail, though her lawyers said that in the coming days a committee formed for her defense might pay the fine and free her. Sudan is partly governed by Islamic law, which calls for women to dress modestly. But the law is vague. According to Article 152 of Sudan's penal code, anyone ''who commits an indecent act which violates public morality or wears indecent clothing'' can be fined and lashed up to 40 times. It was the potential lashing, customarily carried out with a plastic whip that can leave permanent scars, that seemed to raise so many eyebrows. On Monday, diplomats from the British, French, Canadian, Swedish and Dutch Embassies showed up at the Khartoum courthouse, along with a throng of female  protesters, many wearing pants. Witnesses said several bearded counterprotesters in traditional Islamic dress also arrived and yelled, ''God is great.'' Riot police officers broke up the demonstration and took away more than 40 women. Sudanese officials said they were released shortly afterward. Witnesses said the police beat up at least one woman. Mrs. Hussein is a career journalist who recently worked as a public information assistant for the United Nations in Sudan. She quit, she said, because she did not want to get the United Nations embroiled in her case. But just as it did with the closely watched case of a British schoolteacher who faced whippings and a prison sentence in 2007 for allowing her 7-year-old students to name a class teddy bear Muhammad, the Sudanese government sought a compromise. Sudan's leaders are eager to normalize relations with the United States and other Western countries and appeared to come up with a solution in which Mrs. Hussein was punished but not so severely as to attract more international outrage. She was arrested in July, along with 12 other women, who were caught at a cafe wearing trousers. ''I am Muslim; I understand Muslim law,'' Mrs. Hussein said in an interview on Friday. ''But I ask: What passage in the Koran says women can't wear pants? This is not nice.''",2009,"Sudan"
"401","Journalist Jailed for Blasphemy Is Released Early in Afghanistan","MENA","An Afghan journalism student who was jailed for asking questions in class about women's rights under Islam has been freed after nearly two years, a media rights group said Monday. The student, Parwiz Kambakhsh, was convicted of blasphemy and originally sentenced to death. Rights groups have said he was a victim of an Afghan justice system that panders to religious conservatives at the expense of individual freedoms. He was released several weeks ago after President Hamid Karzai signed a pardon in secret, according to the rights group Reporters Without Borders, which talked to his lawyer. Mr. Kambakhsh has since fled Afghanistan out of fear that he will be the target of reprisal attacks, the group said. Afghan officials said they could not confirm his release. Mr. Kambakhsh was studying journalism at Balkh University in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif and writing for local newspapers when he was arrested in October 2007, at the age of 23. Prosecutors said he showed contempt for Islam by asking questions about women's rights and by distributing an article he had taken off the Internet that asks why Islam does not give women equal rights. He also supposedly wrote his own comments on copies of the article. The original death sentence set off an international uproar, and in a second trial, judges lightened the sentence to 20 years. Rights groups sent thousands of petitions condemning the imprisonment and calling for Mr. Kambakhsh's release. The case will be remembered as a ''miscarriage of justice marked by religious intolerance, police mistreatment and incompetence on the part of certain judges,'' Jean-Francois Julliard, secretary general of Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, said in a statement.",2009,"Afghanistan"
"402","Iranians Gather in Grief, Then Face Police","MENA","Robert F. Worth reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Nazila Fathi from Toronto.  Thousands of people gathered in Tehran on Thursday to commemorate those killed in Iran's post-election crackdown, but a vast deployment of police officers used tear gas and wooden batons to disperse them, in some of the largest and most violent street clashes in weeks. The mourners gathered at the freshly-dug graves of protesters, including Neda Agha-Soltan, a young woman whose bloodied image has become an icon of the opposition movement. As opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi arrived at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, the police barred him from entering, and angry mourners chanted ''Neda lives! Ahmadinejad is dead!'' referring to Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, witnesses said. Later, large crowds massed in several areas in central and northern Tehran, but riot police mostly beat them back, and there were reports of a number of arrests. Opposition leaders had hoped for a vast and peaceful public outpouring, despite the withering summer heat and the Interior Ministry's refusal to grant permission for the gathering. Outrage over the deaths in prison of several protesters has spread to Iran's hard-liners in recent days, and Thursday was a day of unusual symbolic importance: the end of the 40-day mourning period after Ms. Agha-Soltan and others were killed. But the authorities, after releasing 140 detainees on Tuesday in an apparent effort to defuse the issue, were equally determined to prevent a broad show of popular discontent. Hundreds of police officers surrounded the mourners at the cemetery, and riot police officers began gathering in force in central Tehran early in the day. On Wednesday, the leader of the Revolutionary Guards in Tehran, Abdullah Araghi, issued a stern warning against any public mourning ritual, saying, ''We are not joking -- we will confront those who want to fight against the clerical establishment,'' the semiofficial Fars news agency reported. Some opposition supporters were heartened by the turnout on Thursday. ''You see they never thought this many people would turn out in the heat like this,'' said a 45-year-old woman at the cemetery, where thick crowds of people chanted slogans deriding President Ahmadinejad as a dictator and calling on him to resign. ''They can't stop it now.'' On Thursday, Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, became the latest prominent figure to speak out forcefully against prison deaths and abuses that occurred during the crackdown. ''Crimes have taken place and people have died,'' Mr. Khatami told a group of lawmakers. ''Our people, young women and men, have been treated in ways that if it had taken place in foreign prisons, everyone would be screaming that it must be confronted.'' Conservative figures in Parliament have made similar comments, and at least two investigations of the prison abuses are underway. A number of senior hard-line figures attended a mourning service on Tuesday for one of those who died in prison, Mohsen Ruholamini, the son of an adviser to Mohsen Rezai, a conservative presidential candidate, the Tabnak Web site reported. On Thursday the government made another conciliatory gesture, moving Saeed Hajjarian, a prominent reformist who is seriously ill, from prison to a ''state-owned'' house with proper medical facilities, the semiofficial Mehr news agency reported. Two other detainees, a political activist and a journalist, were also released, opposition Web sites reported. Public anger is rising at a difficult time for Mr. Ahmadinejad, who won the election on June 12 in a landslide that opposition supporters say was rigged. This month Mr. Ahmadinejad refused a direct order from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to drop a contested cabinet appointment. That provoked many hard-liners, who have warned that he may not last as president if he does not show more respect for the revered Ayatollah Khamenei. The deputy ultimately withdrew, but Mr. Ahmadinejad then named him chief of staff. Some on both sides of Iran's political divide have linked the prison abuse to Mr. Ahmadinejad's flouting of Ayatollah Khamenei's authority, hinting that a broader lack of accountability is the problem. Lawmakers have complained that they were not given access to the those arrested after the election, who are widely believed to be under the control of the Revolutionary Guards. Many in the opposition say the election amounted to a coup by the guards, where Mr. Ahmadinejad spent formative years. ''This is the only way that we can stop everything from falling into the hands of the Revolutionary Guards,'' said a 29-year-old physiotherapist who came to the cemetery. ''You see, now they don't even take notice of the clerics, it's gone that far.'' The mourning ceremony quickly turned into a tense standoff between the police and opposition supporters. At one point, mourners gathered around Mehdi Karroubi, a reformist cleric and presidential candidate. The police surrounded them, apparently trying to intimidate Mr. Karroubi, who spoke to the crowd without a megaphone. Later, after Mr. Moussavi was denied entry by the police, mourners began chanting angry slogans, and the police charged with their batons, leaving many people bruised and bleeding. A number of people were arrested, including two prominent filmmakers, Jafar Panahi and Mahnaz Mohammadi, Web sites reported. ''I was telling them not to beat this girl -- she was on the ground -- and then they hit me on the legs,'' said a 45-year-old woman, who was sitting on the grass, recovering. ''If only these dead would rise up and help us.'' Later, many of the mourners headed to central Tehran to regroup at the Grand Mossalah, a vast prayer hall. But the police had closed the station that is nearest the hall, witnesses said. Instead, the mourners got off one stop before the station, and were met by riot police officers wearing protective gear and clutching bulletproof shields. The police charged at the protesters, scattering them, witnesses said. Similar confrontations took place throughout the evening as protesters gathered in Vanak Square and other places. As in earlier protests, young women were often at the forefront, hurling rocks at riot police officers and shouting in their faces. ''It is clear from the number of people that they have not felt intimidated by the arrests and killings,'' one witness said. ''The crowd is still as large as it was weeks ago, and you see people from all classes and ages.''",2009,"Iran"

"404","Iran's Human Rights Test","MENA","Iranians are expected to turn out in record numbers tomorrow to elect a president. The world is watching. For many Iranians, this election will be a litmus test of the current government's claim that Iran is ""the freest country in the world."" While it is not officially on the ballot, the future of human rights in Iran is at stake. In the past four years -- and particularly since the Obama administration came into office -- the government in Tehran, which has said it seeks to bring ""kindness and justice to the world,"" has stepped up its harassment of human rights defenders. Its actions have put the Iranian government in violation of some of its own laws as well as some of its international commitments, including the 1998 U.N. Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. Women are frequently targets for such harassment. More often than not, their only ""crime"" seems to be that they are tirelessly working to bring about a more democratic system in Iran. In my legal work in the past two years alone, I have defended more than 50 women unjustly jailed or detained by the Iranian government for their efforts to enact legislation that is less discriminatory to women than existing laws, exercise their basic political rights and enjoy freedom of the press. The situation for many women is difficult. Consider the recent case of Roxana Saberi, a young Iranian American journalist who was sentenced in April to eight years in prison for spying for the United States while working for the BBC and National Public Radio; not only was there nearly no evidence against her, but Saberi was denied even the basic right to defend herself. (On appeal, Saberi's sentence was reduced to two years, suspended; she was released and has returned to the United States.) A great deal of government pressure is also imposed on the young women who launched the One Million Signatures Campaign, a grass-roots movement to reform the legal system and educate the public about discrimination against women. So far, they have collected signatures -- many of them from Iranian men -- and have talked face to face with thousands of Iranians about the importance of legal reform. This work is a powerful example of how a vibrant civil society is acting as a catalyst for change in Iran. From the Iranian government's perspective, however, this work is too powerful. The government has launched a countercampaign against these women, and dozens have been imprisoned, harassed and denied travel documents to leave the country. Although I am more well known internationally than most human rights defenders in Iran, I am not immune to the government's wrath. Last December, Iranian police raided and shut down the offices of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, an organization that I chair, on the illegitimate grounds that it was operating without a permit. The following week, government officials raided my  law office and seized my computers and files. Shortly after, police stood by as a group of ""demonstrators"" attacked my home and office. It is sad that peaceful protests organized by women seeking more legal rights end with arrests and violence at the hands of Iranian police -- while police officers look the other way during violent demonstrations outside my home. Worryingly, in the lead-up to the elections, groups working to ensure free elections have also been targeted. Mehdi Mo'tamdi-Mehr, a member of the Committee to Defend Free, Healthy and Fair Elections, has been arrested. Many Iranians fear these elections will not be free or fair. I am often asked about the elections, but what I think about who should win doesn't really matter. As a lawyer and as someone who has spent my career fighting for and within the Iranian legal system, I am more concerned with the legality of the protection of human rights within Iran. The true mark of success in Iran will be an election that follows due process. Politicians come and go -- but a healthy, functioning and fair legal system is the people's long-term guarantee for greater human rights. In 2010, Iran will be up for a U.N. Universal Periodic Review on human rights. One of the important issues addressed in that review will be the manner in which government officials have treated human rights defenders. This week I wrote to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, calling upon him to reopen the Defenders of Human Rights Center and to end the harassment of civil, political and human rights activists. In 2005, I wrote that Iran is undergoing a process of ""awakening"" -- it is a society undergoing profound social change. The latest government crackdowns on journalists and human rights defenders are unacceptable, but they will not deter Iranians from their chosen path. Iranians deserve a system that protects their rights. I am confident that this bold young generation of activists will not let the irrational acts of those who seek to hold our country back prevent them from systematically working to move Iran forward. It is not an easy path, but most worthwhile ones rarely are. Shirin Ebadi, a lawyer, is a founding member of the Nobel Women's Initiative.

"405","The Hidden Victims of Wartime Rape","MENA","Lara Stemple is the director of graduate studies and of the Health and Human Rights Law Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law.  Los Angeles AS disturbing new reports of male rape in Congo made clear, wartime sexual violence isn't limited to women and girls. But in its ongoing effort to eradicate rape during conflict, the United Nations continues to overlook a significant imperative: ending wartime sexual assault of men and boys as well. Sexual violence against men does occasionally make the news: the photographs of the sexual abuse and humiliation of Iraqi men at the Abu Ghraib prison, for example, stunned the world. Yet there are thousands of similar cases, less well publicized but well documented by researchers, in places as varied as Chile, Greece and Iran. The United Nations reported that out of 5,000 male concentration camp detainees held near Sarajevo during the Bosnian conflict, 80 percent acknowledged having been abused sexually. In El Salvador, 76 percent of male political prisoners told researchers they had experienced sexual torture. Rape has long been a way to humiliate, traumatize and silence the enemy. For many of the same reasons that combatants assault women and girls, they also rape men and boys. Nevertheless, international legal documents routinely reflect the assumption that sexual violence happens only to women and girls. There are dozens of references to ''violence against women'' -- defined to include sexual violence -- in United Nations human rights resolutions, treaties and agreements, but most don't mention sexual violence against men. Ignoring male rape has a number of consequences. For one, it not only neglects men and boys, it also harms women and girls by reinforcing a viewpoint that equates ''female'' with ''victim,'' thus hampering our ability to see women as strong and empowered. In the same way, silence about male victims reinforces unhealthy expectations about men and their supposed invulnerability. Such hyper-masculine ideals encourage aggressive behavior in men that is dangerous for the women and girls with whom they share their lives. Sex-specific stereotypes also distort the international community's response. Women who have suffered rape in conflict have likely endured non-sexual trauma as well. But when they are treated as ''rape victims,'' their other injuries get minimized. Conversely, when men have experienced sexual abuse and are treated solely as ''torture victims,'' we ignore the sexual component of their suffering. Indeed, doctors and emergency aid workers are rarely trained to recognize the physical signs of male rape or to provide counseling to its victims. Our failure to acknowledge male rape leaves it in the shadows, compounding the humiliation that survivors experience. For instance, the majority of Tamil males in Sri Lanka who were sexually assaulted during that country's long civil war did not report it to the authorities at the time, later explaining that they were simply too ashamed. The United Nations has attempted to take wartime rape seriously. In 2000 the Security Council passed Resolution 1325 which, among other things, promotes gender-sensitive training in peacekeeping, encourages hiring more women in peacekeeping roles and calls for better protection of women and girls in conflict zones. This is a crucial undertaking, but the agreement neglects to address sexual violence against men and boys. At a ceremony last year marking the resolution's 10th anniversary, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the United States would develop a plan to accelerate the advancement of its goals, including $44 million for women's equality initiatives around the world. This is an important commitment. But the American government should expand its efforts to include the many international programs working with men and boys to challenge entrenched ideas about manhood and to stop the cycle of violence. The International Criminal Court, nearly all American states and many countries use a sex-neutral definition of sexual assault. The United Nations and the White House must likewise move beyond the shortcomings of Resolution 1325 and commit to ending wartime sexual violence against everyone.",2011,"Iraq"
"406","For Afghan Woman, Justice Runs Into Unforgiving Wall of Custom","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- When the Afghan government announced Thursday that it would pardon a woman who had been imprisoned for adultery after she reported that she had been raped, the decision seemed a clear victory for the many women here whose lives have been ground down by the Afghan justice system. But when the announcement also made it clear that there was an expectation that the woman, Gulnaz, would agree to marry the man who raped her, the moment instead revealed the ways in which even efforts guided by the best intentions to redress violence against women here run up against the limits of change in a society where cultural practices are so powerful that few can resist them, not even the president. The solution holds grave risks for Gulnaz, who uses one name, since the man could be so humiliated that he might kill his accuser, despite the risk of prosecution, or abuse her again. The decision from the government of President Hamid Karzai is all the more poignant coming as Western forces prepare to leave Afghanistan, underscoring the unfinished business of advancing women's rights here, and raising questions of what will happen in the future to other women like Gulnaz. Indeed, what prompted the government to act at all was a grass-roots movement that began after Gulnaz was featured in a recent documentary film commissioned by the European Union, which then blocked the film's release. Supporters of the filmmakers charged that European officials were shying away from exposing the sort of abuses Afghan women routinely suffer for fear of offending their host government. While Gulnaz's pardon is a victory for both Clementine Malpas, a filmmaker who spent nearly six months on the documentary, and for Kimberley Motley, an American lawyer here who took Gulnaz's case on a pro bono basis, it also shows that for women in the justice system, the odds are stacked against them. The banned film, ''In-Justice: The Story of Afghan Women in Jail,'' which was seen by The New York Times, profiles three Afghan women who were in prison. One was Gulnaz, then about 19, who gave birth to the child of her rapist in prison, after initially being sentenced to three years. In a second trial, her sentence was increased to 12 years, but a judge on camera offered her a way out: marry her rapist. A second woman in the film was abused by her husband and ran away with a man she fell in love with; both are now in prison for adultery. The third woman was a child of 14, who appeared to have been kidnapped but was held as a runaway and has since been returned to her family. After the film was completed, the European Union banned its release, effectively silencing the women who were willing to tell their stories. The reason given for the ban was that the publicity could harm the women, because an Afghan woman who has had sex out of wedlock can easily become the victim of a so-called honor killing. The women had not given their written consent to be in the film, said Vygaudas Usackas, the European Union's ambassador to Afghanistan. But an e-mail obtained by The Times from someone supportive of the filmmakers suggested that the European Union also had political reasons for the ban. The e-mail addressed to the filmmakers by the European Union attache for justice, the rule of law and human rights, Zoe Leffler, said the European Union ''also has to consider its relations with the justice institutions in connection with the other work that it is doing in the sector.'' Even if the women in the film ''were to give their full consent,'' the European Union would not be '' willing to take responsibility for the events that could ensue and that could threaten the lives of the documentary's subjects,'' the e-mail said. Mr. Usackas said that concern for the women was central in the European Union's decision. ''Not only does the E.U. care about women, but we have spent over 45 million euros,'' about $60 million, ''in support of different programs for women,'' he said, adding that the European Union also finances shelters for women. Word of the film's suppression percolated through human rights groups here to the point that many in the nascent Afghan women's movement were referring to the victims by name and discussing what would be best for them, given the strictures of Afghan society. Some people circulated a petition urging Gulnaz's release and gathered more than 6,000 signatures, which were delivered to Mr. Karzai. Although human rights advocates came down emphatically on the side of broadcasting the documentary, Afghan women's advocates were more cautious, having been stung by previous cases. In 2010, there was widespread publicity of the case of Bibi Aisha, a Pashtun child bride, whose nose was cut off by her Taliban husband; it backfired. Conservative Afghan leaders started a campaign against the nonprofit women's shelters, one of which had helped Bibi Aisha. They came close to shutting down the shelters, which would have been a huge loss for abused women who have no other refuge. ''When we write or produce articles or movies on Afghan women, no matter how horrible the life of Afghan women is, and we know that is the reality of Afghan women, we want to be very careful not to make the situation worse,'' said Samira Hamidi, country director of the Afghan Women's Network. ''We don't want to block the way for other women who have similar problems and who don't have anyone to help them,'' Ms. Hamidi said. But to not show the plight of Afghan women is to reduce the possibility that the government and the society will ever change. ''It is our position in the human rights community that one of the best ways to highlight a human rights issue is to let the victims speak and to publicize what has happened to them to a wide audience,'' said Georgette Gagnon, an official with the United Nations mission in Afghanistan. The problem for Gulnaz and the other women in the film is the deeply held belief that women uphold their family's honor. Thus any attempt to expose abuse is so humiliating to the family that a woman who speaks out often becomes a pariah among her relatives, ending up isolated as well as abused. Gulnaz's case shows the power of cultural norms. On the one hand, the public campaign for the woman prompted the pardon, which ensures that she will be able to bring up her daughter outside prison. On the other hand, the fact that the only imaginable solution to the situation of a woman with an illegitimate child is to have her marry the father -- even if he is a rapist -- is testament to the rigid belief here that a woman is respectable only if she is embedded within a family. Ms. Malpas said that Gulnaz talked to her about why she felt that she had to give in to requests that she marry the man who raped her, even though she did not want to, explaining that not only would she be an outcast if she did not, but so would her daughter, and she would bring shame on her family. ''Gulnaz said, 'My rapist has destroyed my future,' '' Ms. Malpas said, recounting their conversation. '' 'No one will marry me after what he has done to me. So I must marry my rapist for my child's sake. I don't want people to call her a bastard and abuse my brothers. My brothers won't have honor in our society until he marries me.' '' But, mindful of her safety, Gulnaz also said that if she were to marry her rapist she would demand that he make one of his sisters marry one of her brothers, Ms. Motley, the lawyer, said. This practice, known as ''baad,'' is a tribal way of settling disputes. But in this case it would also be an insurance policy for Gulnaz since her rapist would hesitate to hurt her because his sister would be at the mercy of Gulnaz's brother. Both Ms. Malpas and Ms. Motley said that a shelter had been found for Gulnaz and that they hoped she would go there. But whether such a Western option can prevail over Afghan custom -- and whether Gulnaz will choose it -- is far from clear.",2011,"Afghanistan"
"407","Court in Egypt Says Rights Of Women Were Violated","MENA","CAIRO -- An administrative court ruled Tuesday that the Egyptian military had wrongly violated the human rights of female demonstrators by subjecting them to ''virginity tests'' intended to humiliate them. The decision was the first to address a scandal arising from one of the military's first crackdowns on protesters, on March 9, less than a month after it seized power with the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. And the ruling was also the first time since the military takeover that a civilian court has attempted to exert judicial authority over the ruling generals, who have suspended the Constitution and set themselves up as the only source of law. Although members of the ruling military council have often denied imposing the ''virginity tests,'' the court said in its judgment that it relied in part on a June 27 report from Amnesty International in which a general on the council confirmed that women had been physically examined against their will. The general justified imposition of the tests to safeguard soldiers from being accused of raping women detainees. The court found that protecting against potential charges of rape was no justification for violating women's bodies, according to a text of the ruling provided by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, which helped argue the case. ''These acts involve deliberate humiliation and intentional insult to women participating in protests,'' the court said in its ruling, calling the military's conduct of the tests ''a criminal offense.'' ''It represents a violation of human rights and freedoms which make up the most sublime constitutional rights and freedoms of all,'' the court declared. Egyptian state news media reported that military officials characterized the ruling as meaningless since ''virginity tests'' were already outside military procedures. The officials said a military court is investigating whether an unnamed army doctor might have conducted the tests. The decision comes at a moment when there is outrage internationally and domestically at recent episodes of military brutality toward civilian demonstrators, including women. There was recently video of soldiers beating and stripping female protesters in Tahrir Square earlier this month that inspired thousands of women to march through the capital last week in the largest such event in modern Egyptian history. The virginity-test case, however, arose from the military's March 9 demolition of a small tent city still left in Tahrir Square after the February protests. Soldiers arrested about 200 demonstrators, including about 20 women, according to the subsequent testimony of many of those detained. Most, both men and women, were beaten severely. Some said they were tortured with electric prods or stun guns. Along with more than a 100 men, 17 women were convicted of ''thuggery'' in quick military trials and detained on a base. The next day, according to the separate testimonies of at least six women who have either spoken publicly or to human rights groups, seven of the woman were forced to undergo the invasive physical examinations -- ''virginity tests'' -- by an army doctor. Adding to the humiliation, soldiers watched, the women said. ''It was painful,'' one of the women, Samira Ibrahim, 25, told the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, according to its report on the event. All were released within days on suspended sentences. Until recently, the Egyptian news media, cowed by the ruling generals' investigations of journalists and bloggers who were deemed to ''insult'' the institution of the military, scarcely covered the charges. Of the seven women, only Ms. Ibrahim spoke publicly about her experiences or filed legal claims. On Tuesday, news of the decision was widespread in the Egyptian news media. Ms. Ibrahim was cheered as a hero by hundreds of supporters who marched with her to Tahrir Square. Men formed a ring around a group of women marching, to protect them from harassment.",2011,"Egypt"
"408","4 Afghan Men Held in Acid Attack Connected to a Spurned Marriage Proposal","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- It was after dark when the four gunmen battered their way into the small home in the northern city of Kunduz, threw the father of the family into his cowshed and broke into his house to throw corrosive acid on his three school-age daughters. Their chief target was Mumtaz, 18. One of the attackers had asked for her hand, and had been rebuffed by her father, a poor laborer named Sultan Mohammed. Now the spurned suitor and his brothers, who are suspected of being members of a local militia, were taking revenge. They splashed her face and hands with the acid and threw it on her two younger sisters and her mother, according to Mr. Mohammed and local government officials. On Friday, four of the men suspected of being involved in the attack, which took place on Nov. 28, were brought to the capital, Kabul, from Kunduz by the Interior Ministry for investigation and, potentially, prosecution. They were arrested Thursday in Kunduz. Mr. Mohammed came to the ministry on Friday to give a news conference. Human rights advocates praised the Afghan government's public stand on the case and its fast reaction. The police department in Kunduz Province, where the attack occurred, moved quickly to find the suspects, making arrests within 10 days, and the Interior Ministry called the crime ''brutal violence.'' ''The attackers defamed Afghanistan in the eyes of the world,'' said the ministry's spokesman, Sediq Sediqui. ''It was the harshest violence they could ever carry out.'' He said that the Afghan police were warning ''those who commit such brutal acts that they will be brought to justice at any cost.'' Afghan women's advocates and Georgette Gagnon, human rights director for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, said they hoped that the government would prosecute the attackers under the Elimination of Violence Against Women law, which was passed last year. It outlawed for the first time a number of traditional practices that are harmful to women, although in some cases it requires that the victim of the crime file a complaint against the suspect, such as in cases of under-age marriage and when women are traded to settle disputes. In reality, a woman in such a situation would rarely be in a position to protest to a court. The law, however, specifically prohibits chemical attacks on women. ''According to this law, the attacker gets a punishment of at least 10 years of imprisonment and at most life imprisonment,'' said Nadera Geya, head of the Directorate of Women's Affairs in Kunduz Province, adding that she was requesting that the government apply that law to those men if they were convicted. ''It is an inhumane action against women in Afghanistan,'' Ms. Geya said, referring to the acid attack. The United Nations in a report issued last month noted that in the first year that Afghanistan enacted the law banning violence against women, from March 2010 to March 2011, there had been 2,299 complaints of gender-motivated abuse registered with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, but that only 7 percent of those cases ended up in a prosecution. Acid attacks on women are not an everyday occurrence, but they have taken place in a number of areas of the country. They are often carried out in conservative rural areas by men and aimed at girls who are going to school. Particularly sinister in this case was the possibility that the attackers were militia members. The north of Afghanistan has had a proliferation of groups of irregular gunmen in the last two years who work locally, sometimes protecting their neighborhoods and villages, but often terrorizing residents, extorting money and goods. Kunduz has had a particular problem with the numerous militias, the so-called arbakai, in its area. Only a small percentage of the men are in a program run by American Special Forces to train them as neighborhood watchmen for their communities. The others often receive weapons and some financial support from the government as a buffer against Taliban insurgents. The Kunduz security commander, Brig. Gen. Ghulam Mohammad Farhad, described the attackers as ''illegal gunmen,'' and Ms. Geya said they were members of an arbakai. From the point of view of Mr. Mohammed, the girls' father, what was most upsetting was that he knew the men who disfigured his daughters and beat his wife. ''I knew these men very well,'' he said. ''They use the same mosque as we use, and I did not get any warning from them before this incident. It was a sudden and shocking event.'' The spurned suitor, Naseer, has gone into hiding and was not one of those detained, though he was there the night of the attack, Mr. Mohammed said. Among the four arrested were Naseer's older brother, who may also have been involved in planning the attack, Mr. Mohammed said. He had rejected Naseer's offer of marriage at the time it was made, he said, because his daughter was too young. Recently he and his wife, with the agreement of his daughter, had searched for a suitable fiance and had found one. She was to marry in a few weeks. Now, wedding plans are in limbo. A disfigured girl is hard to arrange a marriage for, and in any case, she was so badly burned that she could not be treated in Afghanistan and was sent to India.",2011,"Afghanistan"
"409","SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A17","MENA","What happened toCBS's Lara Logan Usually, this is a humor blog. But this is not funny. CBS News reported that on Friday, as news of Hosni Mubarak's resignation flooded the crowd in Cairo, reporter Lara Logan was assaulted: ""In the crush of the mob, she was separated from her crew. She was surrounded and suffered a brutal and sustained sexual assault and beating before being saved by a group of women and an estimated 20 Egyptian soldiers."" This sort of story has a pernicious staying power: not a faceless statistic, but a known, blond, white woman. Fortunately or unfortunately, these are the stories that linger. They take up space in the public mind and swell to elephantine proportions in the course of debate. It is always dangerous to extrapolate too much from a particular story. But this is already beginning to happen. I think two points bear keeping in mind. They are the acts of an isolated group of individuals. But when we contemplate the statistics and the experience of women in this culture, we have to ask: How isolated? Egypt is not a free society. Yes, it is free of Mubarak's rule. But its women - even when shrouded in the hijab - are not free to pass through the street without being groped and subjected to catcalls. In 2008, as Slate reporter Sarah Topol noted, a study by the Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights reported that 83 percent of women experienced harassment - and that 98 percent of foreign female visitors did. And 62 percent of men admitted to perpetrating it. Living in the United States, I take for granted my ability to walk unmolested in the street. I don't believe what happened to Lara Logan could have happened here. And the idea that such a horror could take place in the midst not of pervasive violence but of celebration is especially shocking. Yes, this is only one vivid and shocking incident. And one bright spot in this bleak narrative is that it was Egyptian women who helped rescue her. But there is still a long way to go. It is not cultural imperialism to state that women have the right not to be assaulted, regardless of race, creed or country. Journalists run many risks. It comes with the profession. But this should not be silently accepted as one of them. My thoughts and prayers are with Lara Logan. It took great courage for her to make this story public, and I wish her a speedy recovery.",2011,"Egypt"
"410","Shame and Anger in Cairo","MENA","CAIRO - On the night of Jan. 25, on the anniversary of the protest that launched Egypt's 18-day uprising, Tahrir Square was still packed from the day's demonstration: shrouded in an ominous haze of pollution, burning garbage, celebratory fireworks and smoke from baked sweet-potato stands. I was navigating my way through the crush of bodies when I saw the twinkle in his eye: a kid in his late teens or early 20s with a friend headed straight for me. Suddenly, part of me knew it was coming. In retrospect, it was totally obvious. As I passed him, I felt it: a hand on my behind, fingers clenching for a handful of flesh through jeans. It happens so often, I didn't even turn around, didn't yell, didn't grab him. I just kept walking. Sexual harassment - actually, let's call it what it is: assault - in Egypt is not just common. It's an epidemic. It inhabits every space in this society, from back alleys to the birthplace of the newest chapter of Egyptian history. A 2008 study by the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights found that 98 percent of foreign female visitors and 83 percent of Egyptian women have experienced sexual harassment. Sixty-two percent of men admitted to harassing women, while 53 percent blame women for ""bringing it on."" There's a part of me that knows I was ''asking for it'' that night because I was walking alone at 9 o'clock in a dark, crowded place. Just like I ask for it in broad daylight - because I'm a breathing member of the female gender. I'm tired of it, and so are Egyptian women. What happened to me was so minor compared to what happens to others. That night in the square another Western female was seriously assaulted: based on a video circulating on the Internet, it appears the woman was mobbed and grabbed; unconfirmed Twitter reports say her clothes were torn and she was taken away by an ambulance. Two days later, another Western woman was attacked. Social media sites exploded with rage and chagrin. The usual excuses were rolled out for those attacks. I saw them posted on Twitter and I heard from an acquaintance: They're kids, it's a mob mentality. Please know, these defenders say, Egyptians are poor, the economy is in a tailspin, people don't have enough money for a dowry, so they can't get married. They are frustrated and act out. And there was the widespread theory that the perpetrators were state security plants, bent on destabilizing the revolution and intimidating women from joining the protests. I don't buy it. Egypt can do better. It already has. For the 18 days of protest last year, for me, Tahrir Square was a harassment-free zone. I noticed it, everyone did. But as soon as President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, the unity ended and the harassment returned. Sexual harassment is not just a problem on the country's streets; it's even been a government policy. Samira Ibrahim, a 25-year-old marketing manager, recently began a court case against Egypt's military rulers for subjecting her and other female detainees to forced ""virginity tests."" Ibrahim was arrested at a Tahrir Square protest on March 9 and taken to a military base, where she was told to strip her clothes and lay down for inspection. It's revolting. It's not just about a government or thugs preventing women from joining protests. And it's not just about the powerless, poverty-stricken, sexually-frustrated man exerting power over someone even less powerful to feel some amount of authority. It's about the complete attempt to oppress women and dismiss their voices. Egyptian women are fighting back. After an anonymous woman was beaten and stripped by military police clearing Tahrir Square in late December, thousands of women marched for their rights to harassment-free space. They were protected by a human cordon of men, moving with them as they marched. It was beautiful, but even in the thousands, women needed protection. There are also Web sites to report harassment and plenty of Egyptian women have taken it upon themselves to champion the cause. At its heart, Egypt is a patriarchal society. (For example, of 498 elected members of the new Parliament, 9 are women.) It's going to take a societal shift to put a complete end to the excuses I've been hearing. Last year, Egyptians brought down a three-decade-long dictatorship. They created a space where women were safe, where they chanted louder. The country - both men and women - need to harness that power and do it again everywhere.",2012,"Egypt"

But before writing that one up, the blog will pause today to update its blog roll and point to a new Web site worth watching: Women Under Siege. The site went up Wednesday, along with a CNN.com opinion article written by Gloria Steinem and Lauren Wolfe. It is the online presence of a new project of the Women's Media Center, the New York-based nonprofit. The project will focus on how rape and sexual violence are used as a tool of war, and will advocate for means to halt these crimes where they are occurring and to prosecute those who commit them. The new site states its mission bluntly; Women Under Siege looks to be a project with an edge. But there is another reason to visit the Web site: its original content. It was launched this week with several strong offerings, including a piece on rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo by Lynsey Addario, a photographer who regularly works for The New York Times, an essay by Lara Logan, the CBS correspondent who was sexually assaulted last year while covering the protests in Cairo, and a video detailing investigators' work to document patterns of crimes against women in Guatemala's 36-year-long civil war.

"412","Virginity Tests, a Trial for Egypt","MENA","CAIRO - On Sunday, an Egyptian military tribunal acquitted an army doctor of performing so-called virginity tests on seven female protesters last spring. This is not merely a setback for women's rights in this patriarchal country. It's also a troubling precedent for government accountability, one year after the revolution that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. As the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces prepares to hand over the reins of Egypt to civilian authorities in a few months, the possibility that it will answer for the violence committed by its forces seems increasingly slim. Since the S.C.A.F. took power last year, more than80 protesters have been killed in clashes with security services, and hundreds have been injured. Some 12,000 civilians have been tried by military courts. Controls on the freedoms of association and expression have been tightened. In one of the most emblematic examples of abuses by security forces, last year, on March 9, the army violently cleared a demonstration in Tahrir Square and detained at least 18 women. According to Amnesty International, 17 of them were held for four days. Male soldiers beat them, strip-searched them and subjected them to electric shocks. Seven have said they were forcibly given virginity tests. The military denied at first that any such examinations had been carried out. In May, an army general admitted that they had - but only, he claimed, in order to protect soldiers in case the women later claimed that they had been raped. Then in June, the 25-year-old marketing manager Samira Ibrahim, alone among the seven test victims identified by Amnesty International, filed a suit against the government before an administrative court. This sent shock waves through the country. Ibrahim claimed that while she was in detention a military doctor had told her to lie down and, in the presence of male soldiers, inserted his hand into her ""chastity"" for five minutes. In December, Ibrahim won that administrative case, and obtained a landmark ruling that said the practice of virginity tests was widespread in Egyptian military jails and ordered them banned. ""This was the first time,"" Heba Morayef, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, told me Wednesday, that a civil court ""implicitly criticized the military and ordered them to do or not to do something."" It could have been a promising harbinger for transitional justice, especially as the S.C.A.F. announced that it would investigate military personnel suspected in Ibrahim's case and refer them to military tribunals (the only courts with the authority to judge them). Yet so far only one individual, Ahmed Adel, has been brought to court, on charges of ""public indecency"" and ""disobeying military orders."" And at his trial it was the three employees from military prisons who testified that virginity tests had never taken place where Ibrahim was detained who seemed to win the day. Local activists and NGOs slammed the decision to acquit Adel. Morayef told me she found the verdict ""surreal"" given that while testifying in court she, a CNN reporter and a well-known human-rights activist had named four S.C.A.F. generals who in earlier conversations either had said that virginity tests were routinely practiced or had admitted that the incident with Ibrahim had happened. The army does seem intent on protecting its ownOf the many complaints lodged with military prosecutors for torture and deaths by security forces over the past year, only two have found their way to a courtroom: the Ibrahim case (whose verdict cannot be appealed) and another against three soldiers accused of killing protesters by running them over with armored personnel carriers (which is still under way). Most cases languish without ever making it to trial. The final years of Mubarak's presidency were characterized by an increase in abuses by security officers, who acted as though they were above the law. Little seems to have changed. And as before, only a small minority fights for its rights against all odds. ""No one stained my honor,"" Ibrahim wrote on Twitter after the verdict on Sunday. ""The one that had her honor stained is Egypt. I will carry on until I restore Egypt's rights.""",2012,"Egypt"
"413","Moral 'Crimes' Land Afghan Women in Jail","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Asma W., 36, ran away from her husband after he beat her, threw boiling water on her, gave her a sexually transmitted disease and announced that he would marry his mistress. Fawzia, 15, took refuge with a family that drugged her and forced her into prostitution. Farah G., 16, fell in love with her friend's brother and eloped with him. Gulpari M., 16, was kidnapped off the street by a stalker who decided he wanted to marry her; she turned him in to the first policeman she saw. All of these women and girls were jailed, joining hundreds of imprisoned Afghan women convicted of so-called moral crimes -- often based on the testimony of their own abusers. They were some of the case studies cited in a report released on Wednesday by Human Rights Watch, which interviewed 58 women and girls in prison and found that more than half of them were there for acts that in most countries would not be considered crimes. Many of them were locked up simply for running away, which is not a crime even under the Afghan penal code, Human Rights Watch said. The group called on the Afghan government to release about 400 women and girls imprisoned for similar accusations. Saida T., 16, was separated from her brother in a crowd, and accused of having had sex outside of marriage, a crime in Afghanistan. A vaginal test proved she was a virgin, so she was accused of running away instead, and jailed. The group said that Afghanistan's model new legislation to protect women, the Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which President Hamid Karzai enacted in 2009, had done little to end traditional practices like baad -- giving away daughters to settle family scores -- as well as forced and under-age marriages, and violent abuse by close relatives. ''The majority of the women and girls interviewed by Human Rights Watch for this report appear to have been victims of acts criminalized under the E.V.A.W. law, although those who had committed these crimes were rarely arrested, prosecuted, or convicted,'' the report said. It cited the case of one young woman who fled her home after her husband stabbed her in the head, arms and chest with a screwdriver. The prosecutor said her injuries were not severe enough to charge the husband, because she had not died. ''While the women and girls who flee abuse often end up incarcerated, the men responsible for the domestic violence and forced marriages causing flight almost always enjoy impunity from prosecution,'' the report said. Human Rights Watch, which is based in New York, criticized what it said was Mr. Karzai's mixed record on women's rights. Early this month he issued a decree that women who flee their homes to marry someone of their own choosing should be pardoned, but he also signed off this month on a recent declaration by the country's highest religious authority, the Ulema Council, which has alarmed women's rights advocates. The Ulema Council said that women were secondary to men, should never travel without male chaperons and should neither work nor study if it meant mixing with men. ''Ten years after the fall of Taliban rule, abuses against women and girls are widespread, and redress limited or nonexistent,'' the report said. ''It is a sad irony that Afghanistan's relatively scarce resources for criminal justice are being used to prosecute and incarcerate women and girls for actions that should never be crimes, while impunity reigns for most perpetrators of serious human rights violations and violence against women and girls.'' Human Rights Watch's executive director, Kenneth Roth, who was in Kabul to release the report, met with Afghan justice officials to discuss the findings. ''The government seems to be defending the 'running away' prosecutions because that's what's always been done, but the defense is weak and, I sense, vulnerable,'' he said. ''I'm optimistic that we might be able to end this particular persecution of women victims.''",2012,"Afghanistan"
"414","3 In-Laws Are Held in Torture of Afghan Girl, 15","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Afghan girl's nails had been pulled out, her skin on her ear and nose had been twisted with pliers, and she had been kept in a dark, filthy basement bathroom without proper food or water for five months by her husband's family for refusing to go into prostitution, Afghan government officials said. But she was finally released by the local police in Baghlan Province, in northeastern Afghanistan, last week and will be sent to India for further medical treatment, the Afghan Interior Ministry said on Monday. The case of the young girl, Sahar Gul, 15, has caused something of a sensation in Afghanistan, underscoring the unfinished business of advancing women's rights here. Her mother-in-law and her sister-in-law were arrested last week, officials said. Her father-in-law was arrested on Monday evening, according to Rahima Zarifi, the provincial director of women's affairs in Baghlan. The police are still searching for her husband, Ghulam Sakhi, 30, a soldier in the Afghan National Army who served in Helmand Province, the Interior Ministry said. He had fled, officials said. President Hamid Karzai spoke out about the girl's plight in a statement on Sunday, saying that the case had to be pursued and that the people responsible should be arrested. The swift official response may show a new willingness to help the plight of young women in this poor country, but it also highlights the suffering that officials say is still common. Her mistreatment began after she was married six months ago, when she was 14. The girl, from Badakhshan Province, and her husband did not know each other well, Ms. Zarifi said. When her new in-laws tried to force her into prostitution, she refused, and they locked her in a downstairs bathroom in their home in Dahiney Ghuri in Pul-i-Kumri, the capital of Baghlan Province, Interior Ministry and provincial officials said. They would not let her call her family, and denied her food. They also beat her with a rod, officials said. She was released after her mother traveled to Baghlan and her uncle alerted the local police, who forced open the door to the room where she was being kept. Munshi Abdul Majid, governor of Baghlan, said the search was continuing for the husband and for others responsible for the girl's abuse. ''This is an un-Islamic and inhuman act,'' he said.",2012,"Afghanistan"
"415","A History of Mob Violence","MENA","Natasha Smith, a 21-year-old British journalist, estimates that the number of men who stripped her naked and sexually assaulted her in Tahrir Square on the evening of Sunday, June 4, was in the hundreds. They ""pulled my limbs apart and threw me around. They were scratching and clenching my breasts and forcing their fingers inside me in every possible way,"" she wrote in an unflinching blog post afterward. It takes a remarkable generosity of spirit to suffer that kind of trauma and still feel affection for the place where it happened and the people who live there. Smith's own affection is undimmed: ""This vicious act,"" she wrote, ""was not representative of the country I had come to know and love."" This is generosity to a fault. In the Egypt I know, mob violence is common, and young women deal constantly with the same kind of sexual taunting that in Smith's case escalated into rape. The harassment is best described by those who endure it daily; men witness it only in female company. What observers of all genders can observe can see is an unnerving appetite for public violence. During the heady revolutionary days of February 2011, it rattled me to see how readily people picked up makeshift weapons -- cleavers, clubs, crowbars -- to protect their neighborhoods when the police didn't. I was twice attacked, and on one occasion a mob pulled me from a car and dragged me through the street on the suspicion that I was an Iranian agent. (The suspicion dissolved only when someone noticed that I was screaming in North American English.) A few months ago, while I was eating ice cream downtown outside the sweets shop El Abd, I watched a gang of a hundred or more men chase and savagely beat a man on 26th of July Street. I asked the man next to me, who was licking a strawberry cone, what the victim had done. He didn't know. ""Spy? Thief?"" He shrugged, not seeming to think brutal justice for an ambiguous crime was abnormal or alarming. Foreign journalists' responses to this combination of misogyny and hair-trigger mob violence have ranged from the pragmatic -- will the reporting suffer along with the reporters? -- to the accusatory. Some have taken the Smith incident as evidence that Egypt is so hostile to Western women they should stay at home. Another response, which I hope my female colleagues in particular will adopt, is to study the sociology of mob violence and know when to scram. That means learning to watch for crowd members who are testing whether they can get away with minor acts of violence, such as shoving and copped feels. Smith's assailants started small: ""Men had been groping me for a while"" before the most frightening violence began, Smith writes. Those first gropings, and the failure of anyone to do anything about them, were a cue to expect much worse imminently. Azza al-Garf, a female Islamist parliamentarian, issued a statement of sympathy with Smith. The Muslim Brotherhood published it. The laws against assault ""should be applied firmly,"" al-Garf said -- irrelevantly, since the Egyptian state is incapable of enforcing most laws. The next-best thing would be loud condemnation from male and female politicians, making clear that even if rapists evade punishment, they won't evade the ridicule and contempt of their countrymen. But that would require al-Garf and others to admit that those criminals are their countrymen and that their embarrassing pathologies are endemic in Egypt. Instead, her anemic statement shifts the blame to a shadowy conspiracy. ""There are supporters of the counter-revolution who are desperately determined to tarnish the image of Tahrir Square, behaving in such a criminal and totally unacceptable manner that definitely does do not reflect our values,"" she continued. How many instances of prolonged, unpunished, 100-against-1 gang-rape will it take before she acknowledges that these problems are real and Egyptian?",2012,"Egypt"
"416","Afghan Rape Case Turns Focus on Local Police","MENA","KUNDUZ, Afghanistan -- The policeman spoke with calm and assurance as he insisted that he could not have raped the teenage daughter of a local shepherd, because a mullah had married them just before intercourse. ''Once the marriage contract is done, any sexual intercourse is not considered rape,'' said Khodaidad, 42, who until he was detained in the case had worked for the American-trained Afghan Local Police. His brother Ghulam Sakhi, accused by the young woman of participating in her abduction, sat beside Khodaidad on the floor of a small traditional reception room at the provincial jail here. He chimed in: ''In Pashtun culture, the girls do not have the right to say who they marry and who they don't want to marry. Whomever their parents choose for them, they should marry.'' Neither man has been formally charged, and both deny the abduction and rape allegations. Prosecutors, family members and human rights advocates vehemently disagree with the suspects' description of what happened to Lal Bibi, the young woman. They say there is little doubt that she was abducted and raped and that there was no marriage. They also challenge the idea that any marriage in such circumstances could be legitimate or exonerate the rape. Forced marriage is illegal under Afghan law, said Gen. Mohammed Sharif Safi, the military prosecutor in Kunduz. However, for many people here, including the Kunduz police chief and the spokesman for the Interior Ministry -- both of whom insisted that the case involved forced marriage, not rape -- the former appeared to be less objectionable, although others would regard the line between the two as thin. Interviews with more than a dozen people connected to the case suggest that much more is at stake than the fate of an 18-year-old shepherd's daughter. Her plight illuminates the persistence of tribal custom, the fragility of newly legislated protections for women, and the power of armed men. What constitutes rape is only one of the contentious issues in this case, which first came to light about a month ago, when Lal Bibi and her family took the rare step of going public with their accusations. The case galvanized President Hamid Karzai, who ordered that the culprits be brought to justice and that the police unit involved be disarmed. However, some members of Afghanistan's National Security Council argued that pursuing the allegations could tarnish the image of the Afghan Local Police, a network of American-trained militias they view as essential to maintaining security and keeping the Taliban at bay. While sharing the goal of security, prosecutors and human rights advocates want to show that this is a new Afghanistan, where the rule of the gun should not trump the rule of law. ''The problem is that these people are illiterate and uneducated,'' said General Safi, the military prosecutor, speaking of the police, particularly the unit involved in the case. ''They haven't been told their job description, they don't have a code of conduct, most are former militia members who still have the mentality they had 15 years ago -- they still think they can kill with impunity, rape with impunity.'' ''I am very supportive of the Afghan Local Police program,'' he added, ''It's a very good program, but I am very critical of the recruitment and selection process.'' Still, General Safi said, despite the program's flaws, as a prosecutor he would much prefer to deal with the local police, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry, giving him greater authority to act than is the case with other armed groups. Amid all the shouting, Lal Bibi and her family are very unsure whether justice will be done or whether they will be forever humiliated in their community for having a daughter who, by Pashtun tribal traditions, has been tarnished. Families in similar circumstances sometimes kill the victims because of the perceived dishonor. Last week, the family, which had never visited the sprawling Afghan capital, made the 10-hour journey by taxi from the city of Kunduz, where they had taken refuge, to Kabul and paid for hotel rooms so that the girl's father and grandfather could try to persuade government officials to hear their story. ''We had never been here before, and you know, it is very difficult to get officials to meet with you,'' said Lal Bibi's grandfather, Hajji Rustam, looking down at his shoes, which he had polished for his visits to the ministries. Lal Bibi and her mother had come as well, because as women they could not stay home alone in Kunduz. But they were in another room and were not in a condition to see visitors, Lal Bibi's father said. Two more suspects were detained last weekend, including the man who is alleged to be the ringleader in the crime, Cmdr. Muhammad Ishaq Nezaami, who commanded the local police unit and is accused of ordering Lal Bibi's abduction. Previously, the Kunduz police chief and others said that Commander Nezaami and the other man had left the area, but the two were apprehended in the outpost where they previously worked. Mr. Karzai's order to disarm the police unit involved in the episode seems to have been largely overtaken by events, now that four of the five unit members have been detained. In the meantime, Gen. Samiullah Qatra, the Kunduz provincial police chief, and Col. Mohammed Shokur, the head of the local police program in Kunduz, have brought in a new unit. It is led by the brother of Commander Nezaami, a move that has angered local people who view it as a deliberate taunt. ''Nezaami's brother was driving Nezaami's truck, so people think he is back and that scares them,'' said Hajji Balkhi, an elder from Lal Bibi's village. ''It is an insult, not just to Hajji Rustam, but to all of us.'' Kunduz Province, where the events occurred, is perhaps the most turbulent in northern Afghanistan. While a tenuous security has been achieved recently, barely 18 months ago the Taliban were a direct threat to the provincial capital of the same name; they assassinated the previous governor and the previous police chief, Gen. Daoud Daoud. Like General Qatra, the previous chief had once served as a commander with the Northern Alliance that supported American forces in overthrowing Taliban rule in 2001. General Qatra, like his boss, Interior Minister Bismullah Khan, was enthusiastic when the Americans proposed forming the Afghan Local Police, groups of lightly armed local men trained by Special Operations forces to help fight the Taliban. Some informal armed groups with links to the Northern Alliance, as well as some Taliban who renounced the insurgency, were folded into these new local units, Colonel Shokur said. For his part, General Qatra would rather view Lal Bibi's case as a family affair than as a serious crime. ''There hasn't been any rape involved; it was a forced marriage,'' he said briskly. ''And in this case, the family has claimed their daughter was given as 'baad.' '' Baad is the practice of trading women as a payment to resolve disputes between families, clans or tribes. Typically, when a girl is given in baad, it is the result of a meeting of elders in which both families have representatives. General Qatra did not deny that Commander Nezaami's brother now led the unit, but said it was irrelevant. ''A crime is a personal thing, whoever does a crime should be punished,'' he said. ''You cannot punish my brother for the crime I have committed.'' He brushed off the idea that he might be trying to intimidate the family, saying that he had no choice but to replace the unit with another one. ''We need that outpost to prevent that village from falling into the hands of the Taliban,'' he said. That is small comfort to Lal Bibi and her family, since they feel they cannot return to their tents and sheep. They say they are under threat because they spoke out against the armed men who are supposed to keep them safe. General Safi, the prosecutor, said that he had dealt with a lot of cases, but that this one ''reaffirmed my stance against the mistreatment of women.'' Referring to the many women's projects financed by the international community, he added, ''I realized -- all this money they spent to improve the situation of women, and there are still a lot of women who are mistreated every day and whose life condition has not changed much.''

"417","Sudan: Woman Is Sentenced To Death by Stoning for Adultery","MENA","  A woman convicted of adultery has been sentenced to death by stoning and is being held with her 6-month-old baby in jail, activists said Wednesday, in the second such sentence in the past few months in the country. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir said last month that Sudan would adopt a ''100 percent'' Islamic constitution, prompting concerns that the country would apply Islamic law more strictly after the secession a year ago of South Sudan, which is mostly non-Muslim. A court in the capital, Khartoum, sentenced the woman, Laila Ibrahim Issa Jamool, 23, on July 10 to death by stoning for adultery, according to a Sudanese human rights activist, Fahima Hashim. The Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, a women's rights group, said it had assigned lawyers who had appealed the conviction and sentence. Amnesty International said that Ms. Jamool ''was convicted solely on the basis of her confession and did not have access to a lawyer.''

"419","Harassers of Women in Cairo Now Face Wrath of Vigilantes","MENA","CAIRO -- The young activists lingered on the streets around Tahrir Square, scrutinizing the crowds of holiday revelers. Suddenly, they charged, pushing people aside and chasing down a young man. As the captive thrashed to get away, the activists pounded his shoulders, flipped him around and spray-painted a message on his back: ''I'm a harasser.'' Egypt's streets have long been a perilous place for women, who are frequently heckled, grabbed, threatened and violated while the police look the other way. Now, during the country's tumultuous transition from authoritarian rule, more and more groups are emerging to make protecting women -- and shaming the do-nothing police -- a cause. ''They're now doing the undoable?'' a police officer joked as he watched the vigilantes chase downthe young man. The officer quickly went back to sipping his tea. The attacks on women did not subside after the uprising. If anything, they became more visible as even the military was implicated in the assaults, stripping female protesters, threatening others with violence and subjecting activists to so-called virginity tests. During holidays, when Cairenes take to the streets to stroll and socialize, the attacks multiply. But during the recent Id al-Adha holiday, some of the men were surprised to find they could no longer harass with impunity, a change brought about not just out of concern for women's rights, but out of a frustration that the post-revolutionary government still, like the one before, was doing too little to protect its citizens. At least three citizens groups patrolled busy sections of central Cairo during the holiday. The groups' members, both men and women, shared the conviction that the authorities would not act against harassment unless the problem was forced into the public debate. They differed in their tactics: some activists criticized others for being too quick to resort to violence against suspects and encouraging vigilantism. One group leader compared the activists to the Guardian Angels in the United States. ''The harasser doesn't see anyone who will hold him accountable,'' said Omar Talaat, 16, who joined one of the patrols. The years of President Hosni Mubarak's rule were marked by official apathy, collusion in the assaults on women, or empty responses to the attacks, including police roundups of teenagers at Internet cafes for looking at pornography. ''The police did not take harassment seriously,'' said Madiha el-Safty, a sociology professor at the American University in Cairo. ''People didn't file complaints. It was always underreported.'' Mr. Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, who portrayed herself as a champion of women's rights, pretended the problem hardly existed. As reports of harassment grew in 2008, she said, ''Egyptian men always respect Egyptian women.'' Egypt's new president, Mohamed Morsi, has presided over two holidays, and many activists say there is no sign that the government is paying closer attention to the problem. But the work by the citizens groups may be having an effect: Last week, after the Id al-Adha holiday, Mr. Morsi's spokesman announced that the government had received more than 1,000 reports of harassment, and said that the president had directed the Interior Ministry to investigate them. ''Egypt's revolution cannot tolerate these abuses,'' the spokesman quoted Mr. Morsi as saying. Azza Soliman, the director of the Center for Egyptian Women's Legal Assistance, dismissed the president's words as ''weak.'' During the holiday, she said, one of her sons was beaten on the subway after he tried to stop a man who was groping two foreign women. The police tried to stop him from filing a complaint. ''The whole world is talking about harassment in our country,'' Ms. Soliman said. ''The Interior Ministry takes no action.'' For years, anti-harassment activists have worked to highlight the problems in Egypt, but the uprising seemed to give the effort more energy and urgency. Over the holiday, the groups staked out different parts of Cairo's downtown. One avoided any violence, forming human chains between women and their tormentors. The other group forcefully confronted men and boys it suspected of harassment, smacking around suspects before hauling them off to a police station. One of that group's founders, Sherine Badr el-Din, 30, started her work as an anti-harassment activist by asking men to get off the women-only cars on the Cairo subway, regarded as a safe zone. When they refused, she videotaped them and posted their pictures on the Internet, she said. Last summer, one of the men attacked her. ''I wanted to file a case, but the police officer refused, claiming they were only there to monitor the train schedules.'' She said the group escalated its tactics out of frustration, after the police started releasing suspects the group had caught. ''Violence is not our method,'' she said. ''But the pressure was tremendous.'' Last week, as the group gathered near Tahrir Square, one member had what looked like a stun gun, and another shook a can of spray paint. Most participants were men, and some wore fluorescent green vests, with the words ''combating harassment'' written on the back. They mused on the reasons for the frequency of the attacks on their sisters, mothers and friends, finding no sure answer in the blame often laid on poverty or religion, society's indifference or the state's contagious chauvinism. They seemed more certain of the solution, as they plunged into the holiday crowds over several evenings. Some bystanders were supportive. But when violence broke out, there was less support. ''I will tell the government on you,'' one man screamed as the activists wrestled with a suspect. Sometimes the patrol acted after seeing a woman being groped. At other times, it justified its attacks as preventive. Two boys on a scooter hardly knew what hit them. One minute, they were driving along the Nile Corniche, saying something -- maybe lewd, maybe not -- to two girls strolling on the sidewalk. The next, they were being hauled off the scooter by the men in green vests. The melee that broke out afterward stopped traffic on one of downtown's busiest roadways, before the police chased the patrol members off. Afterward, Muhaab Selim, 23, a member of the group, could barely contain his anger. ''Why do I have to wait until he touches them?'' he yelled. ''Why do people defend the harassers?'' By the end of the holidays, one of the group's leaders, Muhammad Taimoor, 22, had been arrested after fighting with a suspect on the subway. Even so, he called the weekend a success. ''We caught some harassers, sprayed them with paint and published their pictures everywhere,'' Mr. Taimoor said. ''The Interior Ministry wasn't cooperating with us at all. They weren't protecting women in the streets.'' While Mr. Taimoor and his colleagues were on patrol, another group, called Imprint, was in a nearby square. Nihal Saad Zaghloul, 27, an activist with the group, said its members stopped more than 30 men who were trying to harass women. When the group believes someone is being harassed, some members form a wall between the attacker and the victim, while others take the woman to safety. ''We don't push back, and we don't fight,'' Ms. Zaghloul said. They ask police officers to be present, in case the woman wants to file a report. Ms. Zaghloul, who became active after she and a friend were assaulted, was less critical of the patrol officers than some of the other activists. ''They are understaffed, and at the same time, they are part of a society that always blames women, although they know it's wrong.'' She worried that the other group's methods would alienate the public. But she added, ''No one understands their frustration better than me.''",2012,"Egypt"
"420","Afghan Prosecutor Faces Criticism for Her Pursuit Of 'Moral Crimes'","MENA","HERAT, Afghanistan MARIA BASHIR, the only woman serving as chief prosecutor in any of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, does more than just walk the line between the progressive and the conservative -- she has, uncomfortably, come to personify it. Ms. Bashir, 42, is used to personal and even physical attacks from traditionalists because of her role as one of the country's most senior female public officials and her work promoting women's rights. The outside world recognizes the ideal she represents as well as the dangers. Last year, in Washington, Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton lauded her with a State Department International Women of Courage award. ''For uneducated men, but also even educated men, it is still very difficult to accept that a woman should be in a position of making decisions,'' Ms. Bashir said, talking in her office tucked behind a gantlet of metal detectors and glowering security guards at the government compound in the western province of Herat. But recently, Ms. Bashir has had to endure criticism of a less-familiar kind -- that she has hurt women with her own conservatism. Ms. Bashir's office is jailing women for so-called moral crimes -- like adultery, or even attempted adultery, an accusation that opens the door to being jailed merely for being alone with a man who is not in the family -- at nearly the highest pace in Afghanistan, according to government records. The country's laws, though they have been changing over the past decade, are still criticized by human rights groups as being particularly harsh for women. And many women are languishing in jail on adultery convictions even though they were the victims of rape, forced into prostitution, or simply ran away from abusive homes. Ms. Bashir insists that she must uphold the law of the land, even as she works to improve opportunities for Afghan women. But concern over her prosecution statistics this fall sent ripples through the human rights community in Afghanistan. Most rights advocates express respect for her. Still, she has become the focus of a whole body of disquieting questions for international officials working here: How far should you support a woman who personally represents change but also consistently enforces customs that the West sees as discriminatory? How far and how long can you push another society to change, and when do you accept it and compromise? In its way, too, her case restates the questions dogging the entire American involvement in Afghanistan: Is the United States here merely to fight the Taliban or rebuild the country along Western lines? And now that the United States has said it is leaving, what progress has really been won, and what will endure when it is gone? Ms. Bashir knows how discrimination feels personally. She was a prosecutor in Herat, her husband's home province, but had to give up her job when the Taliban came to power in the 1990s. She went underground, furtively teaching women and girls from her neighborhood in her home. AFTER the Taliban fell, she got her job back and has been the chief prosecutor in Herat for the past five years, and a focus of attention for the international community. She has worked with the United Nations, giving lectures at high schools and universities titled, ''If I Did It, You Can Do It, Too.'' In those speeches, and in other settings both public and private, she urges Afghan girls and young women to expand their ambitions and strive for jobs outside the home as lawyers or doctors. For many in this country, hers is an unwelcome message. During a recent interview in her office, Ms. Bashir was methodical, even understated, as she discussed much of her work. But when the talk turned to the patriarchal society that dominates here, her eyes showed the fire that distinguishes her -- and has helped her survive -- in a place where women in powerful posts are rare. ''We have the mullahs, we have the former jihadis,'' she said. ''They don't spare any effort to weaken or defame you. They talk about your clothes; they talk about the fact you have been talking to foreigners and talking to men.'' Her enemies do more than just talk. The son of one of her prosecutors was mistaken for hers, kidnapped and later killed. Constant threats, and sporadic attacks, have led her to home-school one of her three children and to send her oldest son to safety in Germany, where her sisters live. The United States pays for her two armored vehicles and eight security guards, she said. Nevertheless, there has been progress here. About half of the students in schools and universities in Herat are female. The fact that more women are coming forward to seek protection under a new law, the Elimination of Violence Against Women Act, shows that women possess growing confidence in the legal system. Her province is one of the top ones for registering cases under the new law. ''They know about their rights,'' she said, ''and they are slowly believing in their abilities.'' Even so, it is not enough, she warned. When she gives talks in Kabul and the men in the audience nod their heads, she tells them that they may approve of giving women freedoms in principle, but that they do not do it for their own wives. THE fracas about her prosecutions began in earnest in October after The Times of London published an article noting that her province was at the top of the list for jailing women on adultery charges. (Precise data in Afghanistan is notoriously hard to come by, however; reporting by The New York Times suggests that by December, Herat was actually second to Kabul.) According to Afghan and Western officials, about 76 of the 136 women jailed in Herat had been convicted of adultery, or the intent to commit it. The United Nations says the number could be closer to 100 women. Ms. Bashir's expression changes, and her eyes dim, when the criticism is mentioned. She says the reason Herat has so many cases may be that it is a big province, and has growing problems of drug addiction and prostitution, which fuel moral crimes. She points out that she has jailed men as well as women on adultery charges, and after investigating the evidence has dismissed more false accusations against women than she has prosecuted. She insists, too, that she does not prosecute rape victims. But she is bound to deal with all the cases that Herat's relatively diligent police force brings to her, she says. And most of all, she has to uphold the law. ''I want to be an enforcer of the law rather than human rights,'' she said adamantly. She suspects the publication of the statistics may be another attack by critics who want her gone. ''It is very difficult for a woman to work in Afghanistan, especially if you have an important position,'' she said, her eyes flashing once again. ''You have to deal with thousands of political conspiracies and problems.'' Despite the controversy, support among her Afghan admirers has not ebbed. ''If she didn't do this, she would be thrown out of office,'' said Manizha Naderi, executive director of Women for Afghan Women, which runs shelters for abused women. ''The law is the problem, and not Maria Bashir.'' The United States has reiterated its support. ''She has fought courageously for the future of her country on many fronts and is a woman to be admired for those achievements,'' David Snepp, a spokesman at the United States Embassy in Kabul, said in a statement. Some human rights campaigners are disappointed that Ms. Bashir is not going further to change a justice system they regard as still deeply flawed. ''The fact that you see so many of these cases coming out of a particular province tells you more about the police, the prosecutor and the judiciary than it tells you about the women,'' said Heather Barr, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, who published a report on moral crimes in March. ''She is brave and she is a pioneer, but nobody is above scrutiny.''",2012,"Afghanistan"
"421","Slow Gains in Justice for Afghan Women","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Women who are victims of violence in Afghanistan are often afraid to report abuses to government authorities and rarely see their cases taken to trial, though prosecutors regularly obtain convictions when cases do go forward, according to a report released Tuesday by the United Nations office here. The detailed study of the Elimination of Violence Against Women Act, enacted by Afghanistan in 2009, found that the use of that law had increased significantly, with prosecutions doubling, but still lagging far behind the growing number of complaints. More than 4,000 reports of abuse of women were recorded by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission from over the seven months ending in October, which far outstrips the number recorded during the 12 preceding months, March 2011 to March 2012. However, in the United Nations' study of 16 Afghan provinces, including some of the most populous, only a small percentage of those reports were registered with the police or the courts, and prosecutors took barely a third of the complaints -- just 163 -- to trial. Still, they obtained 100 convictions. The antiviolence law lists 22 acts that constitute violence against women, including rape, forced prostitution, forced marriage, child marriage, harassment or persecution, and causing injury or disability. The reasons for the huge gap between the number of reports and the number investigated and brought to trial have much to do with Afghan culture, which discourages discussing family troubles with strangers, and with widespread discrimination against women, which leads to ''acceptance of violence against them,'' said Georgette Gagnon, the director of human rights for the United Nations' Afghanistan office, who discussed the findings at a news conference. In many places, the police and prosecutors discourage women from pressing their cases in court, Ms. Gagnon said. The commitment of government authorities varies, with some deeply supportive of the law -- to the extent of risking their lives to help women -- and others reluctant to move cases into the courts. ''Rather than following required legal procedures in all cases, police and prosecutors' offices continue to refer numerous cases, including serious crimes of violence against women, to jirgas and shuras for advice or resolution,'' she said. Shuras and jirgas, tribal councils that use male elders to determine solutions, often return women to the circumstances in which they were abused, and rarely punish the perpetrators. The use of shuras and jirgas is prevalent in ethnic Pashtun areas of the country, but it is not unknown in Tajik areas. Of 52 cases registered by the provincial office of the Ministry of Women's Affairs in Nangarhar Province in eastern Afghanistan, 17 were sent to jirgas, the report indicated. The report noted that in some areas, government authorities appeared to be so reluctant to invite public attention that they reported no cases of abuse at all. That was the situation in Panjshir Province, which is overwhelmingly ethnic Tajik, as well as in Wardak and Logar Provinces, which are both majority Pashtun. In Panjshir, abuse complaints were diverted to jirgas, the United Nations report said. Women are afraid to make their troubles public in part because they fear retribution, Ms. Gagnon said. ''Women will tell you that most of them don't go to authorities to complain,'' she said. ''And how would they go? They can't get out of the house.'' Prosecutors are most active in Herat, in western Afghanistan, and in Kabul, the two largest metropolitan areas, which together accounted for more than half of the instances of violence that were registered with prosecutors' offices. That indicated better systems for reporting there and perhaps a greater awareness of the issues, women's rights advocates said. Still, the tiny percentage of prosecutions outraged the advocates, who said a major problem was a culture of impunity that allowed abusers who occupied positions of power in communities to go unpunished. ''From now on we should stop using the word 'violence' and use the word 'crime' when we talk about this,'' said Selay Ghaffar of the Afghan Women's Network. ''Unfortunately, those who violate women's rights have not been punished, and they still walk free.''",2012,"Afghanistan"
"422","The Military's Dirty Secret","MENA","Pentagon officials have long declared their determination to eradicate the military's notorious culture of sexual violence. To judge from data made public in the last couple of months, they have a long way to go. Sexual assaults at the three military academies are at a record high, according to a December Defense Department report -- 80 reported assaults for the 2011-12 academic year, up from 65 the year before and the third straight year that the number has risen. The report also found that 51 percent of academy women and 10 percent of men who answered a survey in the spring said they had been sexually harassed during the previous year. Twelve percent of women and 2 percent of men reported experiencing ''unwanted sexual contact.'' Meanwhile, an unpublished report by the Veterans Affairs Department shines a troubling light on the experience of veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq. Amy Street, a clinical psychologist with the National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at the V.A. in Boston, surveyed 2,348 veterans of those wars. Nearly half of the women and 10 percent of the men said they had been sexually harassed at least once while they were deployed, and 23 percent of women reported at least one sexual assault. The report found that the offenders were nearly always other military personnel, often of a higher rank. A Pentagon official said increased assault reports at the academies suggested that victims were now more willing to come forward. That may be, but it is also damning evidence of an unsolved problem. As for abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, Dr. Street's results offer evidence of an unjust, largely hidden burden for women in combat zones. Advocates for military women say that as long as women are barred from official combat roles and underrepresented in the academies, the imbalance helps a toxic culture of disrespect -- and criminality -- flourish. The Pentagon has to grapple with a failure of leadership, starting with the cadets and midshipmen who are supposedly the best and brightest of the next generation of officers.",2012,"Afghanistan"
"423","Activists Tackle Sexual Harassment in Tahrir","MENA","Now that Egypt's opposition has returned to the streets, activists are making a renewed effort to confront the problem of sexual harassment and assaults against women who take part in demonstrations. Leaving aside earlier concerns that publicizing assaults would tarnish the reputation of the revolutionaries in Cairo's Tahrir Square, about 100 activists from two new groups, @OpAntiSH and @TahrirBodyguard, gathered on Monday evening at the office of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights to coordinate their efforts to combat a pervasive social problem and defend women from their attackers.

Throughout what Egyptians now call the ""eighteen days"" - from the first demonstrations, on January 25, 2011, until Mubarak's fall, on February 11th - Tahrir Square appeared to be a mixed and tolerant utopia. Cosmopolitan girls wearing Dolce & Gabbana sunglasses stood next to bearded Muslim Brotherhood men and to women in full niqab. People marvelled that women slept each night on the square and that there was not a single reported instance of sexual harassment. But things soon changed. The night that Mubarak fell, Lara Logan, a CBS News reporter, was sexually assaulted by a mob on Tahrir, and many women reported similar experiences. Heba Morayef, who was groped on the square at the time, told me, ""From that moment, the square was not safe in the same way, and you saw, over the following year, a deterioration in terms of risk for women."" Sexual harassment is endemic in Egypt. According to a 2008 survey, sixty per cent of Egyptian men admit to having sexually harassed a woman, and every Egyptian woman I met had a harassment story. I asked each woman I talked to how she dealt with it. Morayef said, ""If I'm on my own, I don't confront it. I've seen how situations in the square can get tricky."" As part of the effort to help women who got surrounded by gangs of men, activists have started to set up watchtowers in Tahrir Square, to allow volunteers to see harassment taking place.

"424","The immorality of 'moral crimes'","MENA","""Please help us."" Those were the first words that my client, Gulnaz, said when I met her inside the Kabul prison that was home to hundreds of women, many of whom, like her, were locked away for so-called moral crimes - adultery or running away from home. The frail 20-year-old clung to her baby, who was conceived through rape and born on the prison floor, where mother and child had lived for nearly two years. Tearfully, Gulnaz recounted the story of the assault that took place in 2009. The attacker, nearly twice her age, pinned her down, tied her up and then savagely raped her. She described going to the police with her disabled, widowed mother to report the rape. There she was instantly imprisoned for reporting the crime. With no male head of household present, the two women were not taken seriously. After years of advocacy by human rights groups and other activists, and a decade of war by the United States and its allies - a war in which the need to uphold the rights of women has often been invoked - Afghan women remain trapped in a legal system that often punishes them for being the victims of brutal crimes. My illiterate client told me of her experience going to court with her illegitimate daughter and not understanding the legal process. She was forced to represent herself after her Afghan lawyer failed to show up, yet the judges who presided over the case refused to allow her to speak. Instead, they berated Gulnaz for lying, insisting that women cannot get pregnant by having sex just once. This assertion was the basis for the 12-yearâ[#x2c6][#x161] sentence that was imposed, with a wrenching caveat: Marrying her attacker would allow her to be ""free."" Unfortunately, Gulnaz's case is not an anomaly but represents the situation that more than half of the imprisoned women in Afghanistan find themselves in - locked up for moral crimes, according to a recent study by the United Nations. I submitted a pardon application for Gulnaz, accompanied by a petition with more than 6,000 signatures. She had no family willing to take up her cause, but the world, as we discovered, supported her release. Standing up for the rights of women like Gulnaz was part of the reason the United States went to Afghanistan in the first place. In 2001, one of the key political arguments that President George W. Bush's administration used to support the military deployment was stopping the terrorists, for whom""the brutal oppression of women"" was ""a central goal."" In November 2001, Congress passed a bill noting Taliban oppression of women and stressing the need for Afghan women and children to have better access to health care and education. International attention to the fate of women in Afghanistan has been an issue throughout the war. In 2009, the Afghan government focused on violence and human rights when it passed the Elimination of Violence Against Women Law. Though this measure garnered substantial support worldwide, oversight has been limited. The law is largely ignored in Afghanistan's justice system, and abused women are routinely imprisoned as a result. While Gulnaz's case brought international media attention to the plight of Afghan rape victims, inside Afghanistan, gross violations of basic human rights are often business as usual. In Gulnaz's case, after we submitted the pardon application, President Hamid Karzai formed a judicial committee with members from the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court and the attorney general's office. They were to investigate Gulnaz's case and, reportedly, the cases of all other women imprisoned in Kabul. The formation of this committee was an unprecedented step for the government: It was directly confronting the realities of women imprisoned for moral crimes. Ultimately, Karzai's investigation found that Gulnaz's conviction was based on oppressive, misogynistic interpretations of Islamic sharia law. These views were in part remnants of the Taliban regime's swift and unforgiving justice system. A more contemporary interpretation of sharia law, Afghan laws and international conventions supported her exoneration. On Dec. 14, 2011, Karzai  acted upon the pardon application and exonerated Gulnaz. He acknowledged that the charge of adultery against her was a ""misjudgment"" and that the cultural norms leading to her imprisonment were long overdue for an overhaul. This decision has the potential to set a precedent for other rape victims seeking justice and is a significant recognition of the persecution that Afghan women have long endured under the veil of cultural appeasement. After 10 years of foreign assistance, it should not have taken the president of Afghanistan to overturn the decisions of three Kabul courts that receive vast amounts of international funding. It should not have taken international media attention to embarrass the Afghan government into finally doing the right thing. And it should not have taken a Western lawyer to give Gulnaz legal representation to achieve exoneration. According to an October reportby the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which works to monitor aid spending there by various U.S. governmental agencies, almost $73 billion has been appropriated to Afghanistan since 2002 . This money needs to be used more wisely. Rule-of-law initiatives, particularly on women's rights, have a better chance of success if the international community exercises more oversight and makes a greater effort to understand how the Afghan justice system really works. At present, I am the only Western lawyer in Afghanistan taking on such cases. Gulnaz's case came to me through concerned people who knew of the miscarriages of justice that she endured. I took it to advocate for her and other women in Afghanistan's legal system. Although her case has a suitable ending, it took agitating for attention at the highest levels in the country to get a rape victim out of prison. The laws intended to protect her, and the international initiatives meant to do the same, did nothing. Clearly most of the responsibility should lie with the Afghan government. Prosecutors and judges perpetuate human rights abuses on women, especially in cases involving domestic abuse, with little to no accountability. Because the justice system has failed to deter people within the government from committing human rights abuses, more than half of the women imprisoned in Afghanistan continue to be prosecuted for moral crimes. The government should establish a standing committee within the attorney general's office and the judiciary to ensure that cases of women charged with moral crimes never make it to court - or at the very least, that women are not prosecuted for being victims of violence. From one ""misjudgment"" could come a real chance to save other women from similar suffering. I realize that it may take years, if not generations, for significant improvements on women's rights in Afghanistan. I am optimistic, however, that Gulnaz's case can serve as a turning point to encourage changes that can protect other women enduring her same plight. One pardon, one release, one woman, is not good enough. outlook@washpost.com Kimberley Motley is an American lawyer who practices in the United States and Afghanistan, where she works on human rights and other cases.

"425","Rise in Egypt Sex Assaults Sets Off Clash Over Blame","MENA","CAIRO -- The sheer number of women sexually abused and gang raped in a single public square had become too big to ignore. Conservative Islamists in Egypt's new political elite were outraged -- at the women. ''Sometimes,'' said Adel Abdel Maqsoud Afifi, a police general, lawmaker and ultraconservative Islamist, ''a girl contributes 100 percent to her own raping when she puts herself in these conditions.'' The increase in sexual assaults over the last two years has set off a new battle over who is to blame, and the debate has become a stark and painful illustration of the convulsions racking Egypt as it tries to reinvent itself. Under President Hosni Mubarak, the omnipresent police kept sexual assault out of the public squares and the public eye. But since Mr. Mubarak's exit in 2011, the withdrawal of the security forces has allowed sexual assault to explode into the open, terrorizing Egyptian women. Women, though, have also taken advantage of another aspect of the breakdown in authority -- by speaking out through the newly aggressive news media, defying social taboos to demand attention for a problem the old government often denied. At the same time, some Islamist elected officials have used their new positions to vent some of the most patriarchal impulses in Egypt's traditional culture and a deep hostility to women's participation in politics. The female victims, these officials declared, had invited the attacks by participating in public protests. ''How do they ask the Ministry of Interior to protect a woman when she stands among men?'' Reda Saleh Al al-Hefnawi, a lawmaker from the Muslim Brotherhood's political party, asked at a parliamentary meeting on the issue. The revolution initially promised to reopen public space to women. Men and women demonstrated together in Tahrir Square peacefully during the heady 18 days and nights that led to the ouster of Mr. Mubarak. But within minutes of his departure the threat re-emerged in a group attack on the CBS News correspondent Lara Logan. There are no official statistics on women attacked -- partly because few women report offenses -- but all acknowledge that the attacks have grown bolder and more violent. By the second anniversary of the revolution, on Jan. 25, the symbolic core of the revolution -- Tahrir Square -- had become a no-go zone for women, especially after dark. During a demonstration that day against the new Islamist-led government, an extraordinary wave of sexual assaults -- at least 18 confirmed by human rights groups, and more, according to Egypt's semiofficial National Council of Women -- shocked the country, drawing public attention from President Mohamed Morsi and Western diplomats. Hania Moheeb, 42, a journalist, was one of the first victims to speak out about her experience that day. In a television interview, she recounted how a group of men had surrounded her, stripped off her clothes and violated her for three quarters of an hour. The men all shouted that they were trying to rescue her, Ms. Moheeb recalled, and by the time an ambulance arrived she could no longer differentiate her assailants from defenders. To alleviate the social stigma usually attached to sexual assault victims in Egypt's conservative culture, her husband, Dr. Sherif Al Kerdani, appeared alongside her. ''My wife did nothing wrong,'' Dr. Kerdani said. In the 18 confirmed attacks that day, six women were hospitalized, according to interviews conducted by human rights groups. One woman was stabbed in her genitals, and another required a hysterectomy. In the aftermath, victims of other sexual assaults around Tahrir Square over the last two years have come forward as well. ''When I see Mohamed Mahmoud Street on television from home, my hand automatically grabs my pants,'' Yasmine Al Baramawy said in a television interview, recalling her own attack last November. She and a friend were each surrounded by two separate rings of attackers, she said. Some claimed to be protecting her from others but joined in the attack. They used knives to cut most of the clothes off her body and then pinned her half-naked to the hood of a car. And they continued to torment her on a slow, hourlong drive to a nearby neighborhood, where, she said, residents finally interceded to rescue her. ''They told people I had a bomb on my abdomen to stop anybody from rescuing me,'' Ms. Baramawy said. The attacks have underscored the failure of the Morsi government, with its links to the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, to restore social order. The comments by the president's Islamist allies blaming the women have proved embarrassing. Pakinam el-Sharkawy, the president's political adviser and the highest-ranking woman in his administration, called such statements ''completely unacceptable.'' She attributed the attacks to the general breakdown in security but also to the refusal of the protesters to allow the police into the square since the revolt against Mr. Mubarak. ''The protesters insist on keeping security out of the square, even to regulate traffic,'' she said. On Sunday, the Morsi government convened a meeting of women to discuss plans for their advancement. So far, though, its most tangible measure to address the problem is draft legislation to criminalize sexual harassment. But women's rights advocates say the bill would do nothing to protect women from social attitudes and scorn that assault victims face in hospitals and police stations -- not to mention in the Parliament -- if they try to bring legal complaints. Ms. Moheeb said in an interview that after she was attacked, nurses told her to keep silent in order to protect her reputation. With police protection negligible, some women are taking their security into their own hands. At a recent march to call attention to the sexual attacks, several women held knives above their heads. ''Don't worry about me,'' said Abeer Haridi, 40, a lawyer. ''I'm armed.'' Members of the political elite, meanwhile, have appeared more concerned with blaming one another. The Muslim Brotherhood ''plotted the sexual harassment in Tahrir Square'' to intimidate the demonstrators, asserted Mohamed Abu Al Ghar, the president of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party. The Muslim Brotherhood said opposition leaders ''ignored the brutal party of harassment and rape'' in the square, according to a column on the Brotherhood Web site. The rapes are ''a disgrace on their foreheads,'' the column declared. Other Brotherhood lawmakers faulted protest organizers for failing to segregate the demonstrators by gender as the Islamists usually do. Some ultraconservative Islamists, now a political power alongside the Brotherhood, condemned the women for speaking out at all. ''You see those women speaking like ogres, without shame, politeness, fear or even femininity,'' declared a television preacher, Ahmed Abdullah, known as Sheik Abu Islam. Such a woman is ''like a demon,'' he said, wondering why anyone should sympathize with those ''naked'' women who ''went there to get raped.'' Ms. Moheeb called such remarks ''scandalous'' and accused Islamist lawmakers of being complicit. ''When ordinary people say such things, ignorance might be an excuse,'' Ms. Moheeb said, ''but when somebody in the legislature makes such comments, they're encouraging the assailants.''  Hania Moheeb described in a television interview, with her husband at her side, how a group of men attacked her during a protest.

"426","Terror in Tahrir Square","MENA","Cairo's Tahrir Square once symbolized the hope Egyptians felt when they overthrew Hosni Mubarak and began building a democracy. But this iconic rallying point for protesters has today also come to symbolize the terror and contempt women increasingly face since the Muslim Brotherhood came to power and the country descended into turmoil. Assaults and gang rapes of women in Tahrir have become so common the last two years that the square is now a no-go zone for women, especially after dark. There are no official statistics. But according to an account in The Times on Tuesday, at least 18 incidents were reported on Jan. 25, the second anniversary of the revolution, during a demonstration against the new Islamist-led government. Six women were hospitalized, one was stabbed in the genitals and another required a hysterectomy. Hania Moheeb, 42, a journalist, told how a group of men had surrounded her in Tahrir, stripped off her clothes and violated her for almost an hour. The scandal is not just that such violence happens. The women are being blamed by conservative Islamists for bringing the assaults on themselves. As Adel Abdel Maqsoud Afifi, a police general and lawmaker, said, ''Sometimes, a girl contributes 100 percent to her own raping when she puts herself in these conditions.'' Such twisted thinking is not only hateful in itself but is designed to keep women, who were at the front lines of the revolution, out of politics and power. If President Mohamed Morsi, his Islamist-led government and opposition political leaders do not speak out unambiguously and repeatedly to condemn the attacks and also bring assailants to justice, they are complicit in the crimes. In the Mubarak era, the omnipresent police kept sexual violence out of prominent public sites and public view. Since the police withdrew from Tahrir Square and other places, sexual assaults have grown bolder and more violent. Attackers are also enabled by certain extreme religious orthodoxies and government policy. This month, when a United Nations conference adopted guidelines for ending violence against women, the Brotherhood condemned the statement, saying it would undermine Islamic ethics and lead to the disintegration of society. Because Egypt is a leader in the Arab world, what it does and says about women and their relationship to Islam matters a lot. The Brotherhood says it is committed to the rule of law and equal rights, but unless those concepts are applied in ways that let women live their lives safely and as true partners and citizens alongside men, they are just slogans and a surefire guarantee of persistent hostility and controversy in a country that can ill afford either.",2013,"Egypt"

"428","Afghan Court Reverses Convictions in Torture of Girl","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- A court has reversed the convictions of three Afghans jailed for torturing a young relative who had refused to become a prostitute, alarming activists who had celebrated the guilty verdicts as a warning to all those who would seek to reverse the strides made by women here in the past 12 years. A family had bought the young woman, Sahar Gul, from her stepbrother for $5,000 and had forced her to marry in 2011, when she was just 13 or 14. When she refused to consummate the marriage, her in-laws locked her in a basement, where they burned her with hot wires, pulled out her fingernails and twisted her skin with pliers for months. She was discovered in December 2011 curled up in a dank and dark corner of the cellar and badly malnourished. Sahar Gul now lives in a shelter in Kabul. Her case attracted widespread attention in Afghanistan and abroad. Three of her in-laws were convicted last year of attempted murder, and each was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The convictions were upheld on appeal, though her husband, who is in his 30s, remains at large. But last month, in a decision that received little publicity, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the appeals court, saying that the violence appeared to warrant convictions for assault, not attempted murder, according to lawyers for the defendants. The appeals court agreed, voiding the convictions and ordering that the defendants -- Sahar Gul's mother-in-law, sister-in-law and father-in-law -- be set free. The two women were released this week after about a year in prison, the lawyers said. They were not sure whether the father-in-law was yet out of prison. Neither court officials nor prosecutors immediately responded to questions about the case. But officials at the women's prison in Kabul, where the two female defendants were being held, confirmed that both had been released Monday. Officials at the main men's prison did not respond to calls for comment. As word spread in Kabul on Wednesday, Western officials said they were still gathering details but would probably have a response in the coming days. Afghan women's rights activists reacted with alarm, and said they would press to have the three defendants retried. ''There's smoke coming out of my hair. I am so angry,'' said Manizha Naderi, the executive director of Women for Afghan Women. ''This poor girl was in the basement for months. If she wasn't rescued, she would be dead. She was starved and burned and had her fingernails pulled out. How is this not attempted murder?'' If the case had once served as a warning, it will now encourage conservative politicians and mullahs to push harder against the rights of women, Ms. Naderi and other activists said. The courts' decisions make ''a statement that violence against women is not that important, that Afghanistan is becoming more conservative,'' Ms. Naderi added. That increasingly looks to be the case. As the defendants were being released this week, President Hamid Karzai made five highly criticized appointments to the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, a government-backed watchdog. The five included a mullah who served in the Taliban government and has opposed legislation protecting women's rights. Another is tied to an Islamist political party dominated by warlords.",2013,"Afghanistan"
"429","Women Rising","MENA","In a Belfast hotel last spring, stories of children and life floated through the rooms. Yet those of us who were present for this meeting of female human rights activists from more than 20 countries were painfully aware of old friends who could not join us. We sang ''Happy Birthday'' to one such woman, Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was serving a six-year sentence in Tehran's infamous Evin Prison. Nasrin, a lawyer dedicated to helping women unjustly imprisoned for their work to gain equal rights, had been convicted on charges of acting against national security and propaganda against the regime. Nasrin was not alone in her predicament. The women in Belfast shared personal accounts of assault, imprisonment, torture, death and fear. Women from Liberia, Myanmar, Colombia, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Sri Lanka and other countries shared information about soaring rates of gender violenceâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]whether due to repression, greed, armed conflict or inequalityâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]and a lack of accountability from governments and society as a whole. What we had in common was the desire to provide our daughters, and generations of women to come, with secure futures. As comforting as it was to find support among like-minded women, it was less than comforting to admit that our calls for change continue to follow a decades-old refrain: We seek the right to live in a world where decisions over our bodies are our very own, to choose lives that we alone desire, and to live without the threat of violence. Sadly, such freedoms continue to be regarded as radical challenges to entrenched societal norms and principles. Good intentions from the international community are not enough. The words that fill declarations and resolutions must be made real. They must be turned into action if survivors of gender violence are to feel the difference in their lives, and real, tangible progress is to be made in preventing violence against women. If I am encouraged by anything, it is by the women working at the grass-roots level. In the last few years I have observed our collective power building steam and momentum: Women are rising up and demanding accountability for crimes not only against them, but also against society at large. In my country, Iran, women have worked tirelessly to challenge and overturn the discriminatory laws imposed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Many women like Nasrinâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]and my young colleague Bahareh Hedayat, a university student sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prisonâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]were jailed for their work as lawyers, journalists or activists, for their efforts to expose the human rights abuses perpetrated by the regime. Despite the very real threat of arrest, women in Iran started the One Million Signatures Campaign in 2006 to attract support from ordinary Iranians for the reform of laws that promote violence against women. Though mass public protests became too dangerous, with many of us detained and charged, we pushed on. We moved our focus to the community level, to try to change mindsets within smaller groups. Iranian women, like women around the world, are demanding fundamental changes that would grant them the right to live secure lives, free from violence. Women around the world, including those in the West, struggle daily with the violence pervading our societies. Political turmoil and armed conflicts continue to bring gender violence. Some change is happening from the top down, but we must be cautious about what that really means. After the recent presidential elections in Iran, for example, the government for the first time appointed a woman as the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, while another woman was appointed to lead Iran's mission in Geneva. Yet under Iranian law, a married woman must still have written consent from her husband to obtain a passport. What would happen if the husband of the new Iranian ambassador were to forbid his wife to travel? The Foreign Ministry's new spokeswoman is not allowed to stand as a sole witness in a court of law, despite the fact that she is trusted to speak on behalf of the nation. The 2013 Islamic Penal Code holds that a woman's testimony is worth half the testimony of a man. Our determination to change the systems that repress us has helped spur many national governments, and the international community, to action. South Africa has opened a groundbreaking investigation into mass rapes allegedly orchestrated and perpetrated by President Robert Mugabe and his party, the ZANU-PF, during the 2008 election in neighboring Zimbabwe. In Guatemala, the first-ever female attorney general is pursuing, at great personal risk, the architects of the country's 1980s genocide in which rape was used to tear communities apart. Indeed, in the past year there has been a flurry of activity to combat gender violence. Britain has led the way, encouraging the Group of 8 and other nations to fund efforts to end sexual violence. In September, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, 113 countries signed the Declaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence in Conflict. This declaration prohibits amnesties for sexual violence in peace agreements and allows suspects to be held accountable wherever they are in the world. It also pledges to adopt a new international protocol in 2014 to help ensure that evidence collected can stand up in court. Such international commitments are certainly very welcome. When countries like the Democratic Republic of Congoâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]famously referred to by the former United Nations secretary general's special representative on sexual violence in conflict as the ''rape capital'' of the worldâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]signs such a declaration, we are encouraged that there may be a real shift in attitude. But we must be careful as well, and not mistake a signed agreement for an actual reduction of violence. Such agreements do little to help those in immediate need. And no one knows that better than the women leading the charge in their own communities. These are the women who all too often see promises made by the international community hijacked by deeply embedded cultural norms and national interests. Some of the same countries that are signing these agreement are also providing military funding to governments that knowingly support war criminals or refuse to arrest them. The continued saga of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan comes to mind: He is wanted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, including orchestrating widespread rape in Darfur, yet he travels freely to many countries. Then there are those governments that point fingers without taking responsibility for violence against women at home. South Africa, with one of the world's highest rates of violence against women, battles its own internal demons while examining Zimbabwe's crimes. Yet in occupations, revolutions and uprisings in the Middle East and elsewhere, women are walking the walkâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]and are highly visible. In India, women have demanded to be heard in protests against violent assaults. Women flocked to the streets calling for regime change in places like Tunisia and Yemen; they filled a courtroom to recount their own rapes in front of a former president on trial for genocide in Guatemala. After years of fighting for their voices to be heard, those who deal with communities impacted by violence are working across borders to bring about change. The International Campaign to Stop Rape & Gender Violence in Conflict, for instance, brings together more than 700 organizations ranging from international powerhouses like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to local groups like Panzi Hospital in the eastern part of Congoâ[#x20ac][0/00] -- â[#x20ac][0/00]a remarkable place that stitches up women who have been literally torn up by sexual violence. Together, these groups make a human chain that uses our collective voice to be heard not only in the halls of power but also in streets, homes and schools. It is at this grass-roots level that the key to real change is found. Most of us live in a patriarchal system that justifies the use of violence. Changing this system will be a long, slow, difficult process. As women, as citizens and as a global community, we must all hold society to account. At the same time, we must recognize that we have become a threat to the patriarchies and governments that try to silence us. My colleague Nasrin Sotoudeh, who could not join us in Belfast last spring, was released from jail in September by the Iranian authorities. The move came just days ahead of a visit by Iran's newly elected president, Hassan Rouhani, to the United Nations General Assembly. Those of us who work to defend the rights of women in Iran know that the regime released Nasrin to appease the international community, and not because it has had a real change of heart. We are so happy to see Nasrin free, but we know that she and other Iranian women are not yet really free. Promises are good; change is better.

The draft, leaked to me by someone desperate to prevent reinstatement of this Taliban-era punishment, is just the latest in a pattern of increasingly determined attacks on women's rights in Afghanistan. The last 12 years have been a time of significant achievements here, hard-fought by Afghan activists. Millions of girls have gone to school, women have joined the police and the army and the civil service. Twenty-eight percent of the members of Afghanistan's Parliament are women, and a 2009 law made violence against women a crime. But signs are everywhere that a rollback of women's rights has begun in anticipation of next year's deadline for the withdrawal of international combat forces. Opponents of women's rights are already taking advantage of growing international fatigue with Afghanistan. On Monday, the United Nations issued a new report showing that while reported cases of violence against women went up by 28 percent in the last year, prosecutions increased by only 2 percent. A parliamentary debate last May on the Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was derailed by conservatives calling for the abolition of a minimum marriage age for girls and arguing against making rape a crime. One of President Hamid Karzai's new handpicked commissioners at the government's previously well-respected Independent Human Rights Commission is an ex-member of the Taliban government who wasted no time after his appointment before calling for the repeal of the EVAW Law, which he said ''violates Islam.'' These setbacks have occurred against a backdrop of continuing day-to-day abuses against women that are so commonplace that some extreme practices go almost unnoticed. About half the women in prison in Afghanistan and about 95 percent of girls in juvenile detention -- a total of about 600 people -- are imprisoned on accusations of ''moral crimes,'' like sex outside of marriage or running away from home. In reality, most have fled forced marriages or domestic violence. Some are survivors of rape who are blamed by the courts for ''immorality,'' sometimes alongside their attackers. Their stories are a call to the Afghan government to do much more to track down and punish abusers of women, and to crack down on police officers, prosecutors and judges who treat women fleeing abuse as criminals rather than victims. Above all, the government needs to end the barbaric practice of virginity tests. Whenever a woman or girl is arrested on ''morality'' charges -- and sometimes even when she is accused of non-moral crimes such as theft or assault -- she is whisked away for a vaginal examination at a government clinic in the province in which she was arrested. There is no opportunity for her to refuse. Because of frequent mix-ups and general inefficiency, some women are sent for the examination two or three times. The examination, carried out by government doctors, results in a report on whether or not the woman or girl is a ''virgin.'' These reports are often used as the sole evidence to support ''moral crimes'' charges in court, aside from a ''confession'' taken down by a police officer immediately after the arrest, which is usually signed with a thumbprint by a woman or girl who has no idea what it says. I have seen cases where a judge used the report as evidence against a girl even when its findings were inconclusive. For many of the 600 women and girls imprisoned for ''moral crimes,'' the doctor's observations are a key factor in her receiving a stiff prison sentence. Forcing these women and girls to undergo invasive vaginal examinations, sometimes repeatedly, to ascertain ''virginity'' as evidence likely to be used against them in criminal proceedings is not only a form of degrading and inhuman treatment strictly prohibited by international law but also a violation of their basic fair trial rights. All of this would be horrific enough if it weren't bad science, but it is. ''Virginity'' tests have no medical validity. A medical examination cannot determine, with any level of accuracy useful to a court, a woman's sexual history. And despite progress in other countries in banning such examinations, there are no signs of this practice ending in Afghanistan. For vulnerable Afghan women, things are only getting worse. One recently proposed law revision would ban victims of crime from testifying against family members -- effectively preventing all prosecutions for domestic violence and forced or underage marriage. Female activists in Afghanistan, who have accomplished so much in the past 12 years, are doing all they can now to prevent that progress from unraveling. Countries, including the United States, have pledged continued funding for services for Afghan women, but in addition to aid they need political support. International support for the Afghan government and its security must depend on continued progress for Afghan women. Anything less would be a betrayal.

"431","Egypt Releases 21 Female Protesters","MENA","CAIRO -- Egyptian authorities on Saturday released 21 women and girls who had been detained for more than a month over a street protest. An appeals court had reduced their harsh penalties to suspended sentences. Last month, 14 women were sentenced to 11 years in prison after being convicted in connection with an October demonstration to support the country's ousted president, Mohamed Morsi. The judge in the case also ordered seven minors to be held until they turned 18. The women were convicted of several charges, including ''thuggery'' and the use of weapons, and the minors were said to have thrown rocks. A defense lawyer, Al-Shimaa Saad, said Saturday that the women's sentences had been reduced to one-year suspended sentences while the minors' sentences were reduced to three months of probation. The original sentences caused an outcry in Egypt and among international human rights groups. Human Rights Watch, based in New York, called them ''blatantly political'' and said the court had violated the right to free trial, by failing to allow witnesses to testify in the women's defense and providing little evidence for the charges they faced. Egyptian activists, including many critics of the Islamists, saw the sentences as evidence of the new military-backed government's intolerance for opposition. The government says the crackdown is necessary because the three years of turmoil that followed Egypt's 2011 uprising have crippled the economy. It accuses Mr. Morsi's supporters of seeking to destabilize the country. But few officials defended the long sentences for the women. The women and girls, who belonged to a newly established group called the 7 A.M. Movement, held a protest on Oct. 31 in support of Mr. Morsi in the coastal city Alexandria. The police dispersed the protest and arrested the women and girls as well as one man, Human Rights Watch said. The man was later released. Six other men accused in the case were sentenced in absentia to 15 years. ''Putting aside the blatantly political nature of this prosecution, the authorities failed to meet even the most basic standards of evidence to prove these women and girls engaged in violence or thuggery,'' said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement issued Saturday. The speedy sentences, coming less than a month after the women were detained, are part of a widening crackdown on Mr. Morsi's supporters since he was toppled in a July 3 coup that followed demonstrations by millions calling on him to leave office. The crackdown has recently widened to include other non-Islamist critics of the current authorities, and a new protest law was passed last month that tightly restricted public gatherings and increased penalties for violators. The 14 women were convicted under pre-existing laws.",2013,"Egypt"
"432","Islamic State Propagandists Boast of Sexual Enslavement of Women and Girls","MENA","In the latest edition of the Islamic State militant group's glossy magazine, posted online this week, its propagandists admitted for the first time that women and girls of the Yazidi faith captured in Iraq had been treated as slaves and forced to marry fighters. The treatment of the women -- which appears to corroborate witness accounts from captives who escaped areas that fell under militant control in Iraq -- was described and defended in an article with the headline ''The Revival of Slavery'' in the new issue of the magazine, Dabiq, published Sunday. [Video: The account of a 15-year-old girl from Iraq's Yazidi religious minority who was taken prisoner by Islamic State militants. Watch on YouTube.] According to the anonymous author of the article, students of Islamic law in the militant group decided that the enslavement of Yazidi women and girls, and their use as ''concubines,'' was justified because their esoteric faith makes them ''pagans'' whose religion needs to be eradicated from the Muslim world. ''Their continual existence to this day is a matter that Muslims should question as they will be asked about it on Judgment Day,'' the author wrote. ''Their creed is so deviant from the truth that even cross-worshipping Christians for ages considered them devil worshippers and Satanists,'' the article added. Members of the religious minority who fled the militants' advance in northwestern Iraq in August told investigators from the United Nations that up to 500 Yazidi women were ''herded'' into the town of Tal Afar in August, before about 150 of them were sent to Syria to be given to Islamic State fighters or sold into sexual slavery. The frank admission by the militant group's propaganda arm coincided with the release of a Human Rights Watch report, based on similar testimony from dozens of relatives of Yazidis still being held by the militants, 16 captives who escaped and two women currently in detention who managed to speak to researchers by telephone. Witnesses also told the researchers that captured men were forced to convert to Islam and that some boys were taken away to be indoctrinated and trained as fighters. ''We heard shocking stories of forced religious conversions, forced marriage, and even sexual assault and slavery -- and some of the victims were children,'' Fred Abrahams, a Human Rights Watch adviser, said in the report. The rights group's report was accompanied by video of escaped captives and relatives of those still in detention describing their ordeal. [Video: Islamic State captives in Iraq: Prisoners forced to convert, girls forced to marry. Watch on YouTube.] ''They were hitting us and slapping us to make us submit to them,'' recalled a 17-year-old girl who managed to escape after being taken to the city of Falluja, west of Baghdad. ''As much as we could, we didn't let them touch our bodies,'' she said. ''Everything they did, they did by force.''",2014,"Iraq"
"433","Afghan Mullah Who Raped Girl in His Mosque Receives 20-Year Prison Sentence","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- A mullah who raped a 10-year-old girl in his mosque was sentenced to 20 years in prison after a dramatic trial here in Kabul on Saturday during which his accuser, weeping and shaking, summoned the courage to confront him. Women's activists attending the packed proceedings hailed the sentence as a victory because the mullah was successfully prosecuted under a 2009 law meant to fight violence against women in a country where rape had long been treated as adultery, implicitly placing partial blame on the victim. The judge in this case dismissed the mullah's Shariah law defense. In addition, intervention by Women for Afghan Women, a group that had earlier sheltered the girl, persuaded the victim's family members to support her. The group paid her family's travel expenses from their home in the remote province of Kunduz, where the crime occurred, so they could attend the trial. After the rape occurred last May, family members of the girl had been overheard plotting to kill her out of shame at what had happened, according to the police and women's activists in Kunduz. Such ''honor killings'' of rape victims are common in Afghanistan. Until the Elimination of Violence Against Women law was passed in 2009, rape was not even a crime. The girl and her father and uncle expressed dissatisfaction with the sentence, saying the culprit, Mullah Mohammad Amin, should have been given the death penalty. A women's activist, Jamila Azizi of the Development and Support of Afghan Women and Children Organization, also said the prison sentence was disappointing, noting that five men were hanged recently in the notorious Paghman gang rapes, where the victims were wives returning from a wedding. ''How and why raping this little girl earns him only prison and they had the death penalty, I don't understand,'' she said. ''He ruined her for life.'' Shackled with chains around his waist, attached to handcuffs, Mullah Amin was obliged to kneel on the floor of the crowded judge's chambers, which were used as the courtroom, while everyone else sat on chairs. The girl, whose name is being withheld for her safety outside her village, sat about six feet away and covered her face entirely with her veil so she would not have to see Mullah Amin, who did not once look at her. She wept uncontrollably as the prosecutor, Mujahid Raidan, read the mullah's earlier, detailed confession and the investigative report detailing her horrific injuries. But when the mullah spoke in his own defense and claimed she had seduced him, the girl stopped sobbing and pulled aside her veil enough to speak directly to him. ''Hey liar, hey liar,'' she said. ''God hate you, you are dirt, you are dirt, you are a vampire.'' Prominent mullahs and some officials in Kunduz had earlier claimed the girl was actually as old as 17, above the age of consent; since Afghans have no birth certificates and generally do not celebrate birthdays, her exact age is hard to prove. But her mother says she is 10, and a forensic medical examiner estimated her age at 10 to 11 years. Judge Mohammad Suliman Rasuli said the mullah's admission that he had sex with the girl could not be considered adultery because of her young age, and was tantamount to an admission of rape. Mullah Amin's two defense lawyers pleaded on Islamic grounds that he should be given the Shariah law punishment for a single person accused of adultery, 100 lashes, and then released. Judge Rasuli responded that such logic would require him to order the girl to be given 100 lashes as well. ''She cannot commit adultery; she is a child,'' he said. ''This is rape.'' The prosecutor did not call the girl as a witness, but she insisted on being heard. ''You shamed me, liar, you destroyed my life, you brought shame to my father,'' she called out. Addressing the judge, she said, ''Please, director, hang him.'' After the girl was raped and activists heard her family plotting to kill her, she was put in a shelter run by Women for Afghan Women, or W.A.W., in Kunduz, and later sent by the group to Kabul for medical treatment. The rape had been so violent that it caused a break in the wall between the vagina and rectum, a fistula, which had to be repaired surgically. Over the objections of W.A.W., she was returned to her family members after they posted bond and made promises through elders not to harm her. W.A.W.'s social workers have remained in close contact with the family. Hassina Sarwari, who runs the Kunduz shelter, has received death threats related to the case, from both the Taliban and pro-government militias. ''She was raped and is a child, and if we killed her, how would we answer to God on the day of judgment?'' said her uncle, Mohammad Rasoul, outside the court. Her father, Najimudin, who like many Afghans uses only one name, insisted the family had never planned to kill the girl. While some women's activists were disappointed that the mullah was not sentenced to death, the violence against women law -- written in collaboration with the international community -- does not provide for the death penalty for any offense against women. The accused Paghman rapists were sentenced to death for armed robbery, which is a capital offense in Afghan law, not for the offense of rape. ''I am happy with the sentence,'' said Manizha Naderi, W.A.W.'s executive director. ''As long as W.A.W. is alive and working, I will make sure that he spends the whole 20 years in prison. He won't get out early if I can help it.'' Ms. Naderi said her organization was trying to persuade the girl's family to let her stay at one of its refuges for children so she can attend school in Kabul. Her family members said they had withdrawn her from school in Kunduz out of shame at what happened. The victim's father neither looked at nor spoke to his daughter during the proceedings, and when they were over, he turned his back on her and walked out. She followed him at a respectful distance, walking past the mullah chained up in the hallway, who kept his eyes on the floor.",2014,"Afghanistan"
"434","BRITON IS GIVEN 13 LIFE SENTENCES FOR THE 'YORKSHIRE RIPPER' MURDERS","West","Peter Sutcliffe, a 34-year-old truck driver, was convicted of murder today in the killing of 13 women over five years and was given life sentences for each of the convictions. Mr. Sutcliffe had confessed to killing the women, and the significance of today's decision was that his guilty plea to the lesser charge of manslaughter on grounds of temporary insanity was rejected. The life sentences were the maximum permitted, and the judge at the Old Bailey here recommended that Mr. Sutcliffe serve at least 30 years. Britain abolished the death sentence in 1965. The lengthy search for the man who was called the Yorkshire Ripper, a source of considerable embarrassment to the police, cost $10 million and 5 million man-hours and involved 21,000 interviews. Mr.  Sutcliffe was interviewed as many as six times by the police and was caught only because he put false license plates on his car. Prostitutes Demonstrate About 50 spectators gathered outside the Old Bailey, a short distance from St. Paul's Cathedral, to await the jury's verdict in the 14-day trial. Among them were representatives of the English Collective of Prostitutes, who chanted and carried signs urging the maximum punishment. Several of Mr. Sutcliffe's victims were prostitutes. The courtroom was packed, and some spectators had waited all night for a place inside. Others bought places for as much as $45 from those who had waited. After nearly six hours of deliberation, the jury of six men and six women announced that they had reached a 10-to-2 verdict. Under British law, unlike American law, a judge in a criminal case can permit a verdict that is not unanimous if no more than two jurors dissent. As the bearded defendant, a resident of Bradford in northern England, stood impassively in the oak-paneled dock, the 20 verdicts were individually called out. In addition to the convictions for the 13 murders, Mr. Sutcliffe was charged with the attempted murder of seven other women. Most Victims Were Stabbed Dressed in the grey suit he has worn since the trial began, Mr.  Sutcliffe made only an occasional chewing movement with his mouth.  ''It is difficult to find words that are adequate in my judgment to describe the brutality and gravity of these offenses,'' said the judge, Sir Leslie Boreham. The victims were first stunned from behind, almost all with hammers, and most were then stabbed. ''I express the hope that, when I have said life imprisonment, it will mean precisely that,'' the judge said.  There were reports today that before the trial, the judge overruled the prosecution's willingness to accept a guilty plea to a lesser charge. Spectators Scream at Him Less than an hour after the verdict, as Mr. Sutcliffe was driven away to a West London prison, dozens of people outside the courtroom screamed at him. Sonia Sutcliffe, his wife, was not in court today, although she later pledged to stand by her husband. The most dramatic moment of the trial came during Mr. Sutcliffe's testimony, when he announced that he was on a divine mission from God to kill prostitutes. Under British law, the technical name for Mr.  Sutcliffe's plea was diminished responsibility, the rough equivalent of temporary insanity. A number of relatives of the victims sat through the trial and greeted the verdict with unrestrained joy. Doreen Hill, the mother of the last victim, said: ''It was the right verdict. I wanted him in a normal prison so other prisoners could get at him. I would like him to be hung. I could kill him myself.'' Jacqueline Hill would have been 21 today.",1981,"United Kingdom"
"435","SPAIN SEIZES THREE LINKED TO BASQUES","West","Spain's antiterrorist policemen have opened a major new operation against the Basque separatist organization E.T.A. and have stunned political and intellectual circles here by detaining two prominent feminists and a leftist university professor. While E.T.A. can still count on considerable popular support in the northern Basque provinces, the idea that intellectuals in Madrid are suspected of helping the organization has been widely viewed here as shocking, particularly since its gunmen are considered a threat to Spanish democracy. The case came to light early this week when a special antiterrorist squad announced that Jimena Alonso Matthias and Carmen Santos, two well-known radical feminists, and Victor Garcia-Hoz, a psychology professor at Complutense University in Madrid, had been arrested on suspicion of aiding an E.T.A. group operating here. The two teen-age daughters of Mrs. Alonso Matthias were also detained. (Police sources said a total of 25 people had been arrested in Madrid, in the Basque country and in neighboring Navarre Province since last weekend, Reuters reported.) The detention of Professor Garcia-Hoz especially shocked many people here because he has ties to the Communist Party, which has condemned terrorism since it was legalized in 1977. 100 Feminists Protest A group of 100 feminists immediately protested the arrests, declaring in a petition that ''Carmen and Jimena have a well-known public record in the struggle for the defense of public rights and the rights of women in particular.'' The feminists, who marched on Madrid's police headquarters, also condemned the use of a special antiterrorist statute, which permits holding suspects incommunicado for up to 10 days. In a long editorial, the liberal Madrid daily El Pais expressed the fear of an ''odious maneuver'' that would exploit the case to tar intellectuals or feminists in general. But a headline in the neofascist newspaper El Alcazar read, ''Communist complicity with E.T.A.,'' whose name stands for ''Basque Nation and Freedom.'' The police followed the announcement of the arrests with a statement that Mrs. Alonso Matthias had led them to an arms cache that E.T.A. guerrillas had placed in the woods near her house in the suburb of Torrelodones. Investigators said they believed that the guerrillas had hidden in Torrelodones while planning terrorist actions in Madrid.",1981,"Spain"
"436","Driver Charged in 'Ripper' Case","West","A 35-year-old truck driver from the West Yorkshire city of Bradford was charged in court tonight with the most recent of the 13 so-called ""Yorkshire Ripper"" mutilation murders of young women in industrial northern England over the past five years. The suspect, Peter W. Sutcliffe, is being questioned by police in connection with all 13 killings and four other attacks that the victims survived -- a wave of murder and violence that terrorized women in the region and prompted a nationwide manhunt of unprecedented scope. Sutcliffe tonight was charged with the murder of 20-year-old university student Jacqueline Hill in Leeds Nov. 17.  Like the other victims, she had been repeatedly beaten and stabbed. Sutcliffe was arrested Friday night with a woman in his car in an area frequented by prostitutes in Sheffield, south of Bradford, by policemen making a routine check of his car's license tags, which turned out to be stolen.  Police then discovered they had questioned Sutcliffe more than three years ago during the hunt for the Ripper. Most of the Ripper's victims have been prostitutes in industrial cities including Bradford, Leeds and Manchester.  Two others were university students, another a clerk and another a shop assistant, all of whom had apparently been walking in or near red-light districts. Psychologists consulted during the investigation, noting that few of the attacks involved robbery or rape while nearly all included unspecified, bloody mutilation of the victims, concluded that the killer had a pathological hatred of women. Both police hunting him and the killer himself, in teasing notes and tape recordings sent to the police, compared him to the Victorian ""Jack the Ripper,"" who terrorized London's notorious Whitechapel red-light district in the 1880s, murdering and mutilating six prostitutes. The Yorkshire Ripper became Britain's most prolific mass murderer in memory, prompting a massive manhunt and focusing public attention on an increasing incidence of violent attacks on women in British cities.  University students in college towns like Leeds and Oxford organized groups to protect women walking at night.  Feminist groups organized demonstrations protesting the inability of police to catch the Ripper and the exploitation of violence against women in the media, particularly in a spate of recent American films now playing here. A crowd of about 2,000 besieged the magistrates' court in the mill town of Dewsbury where Sutcliffe was taken tonight to be charged and ordered jailed for a minimum of eight days without bail while the investigation continues.  As he was pulled by police in and out of the courthouse with a blanket over his head, while television lights and flash bulbs lit up the evening darkness, people screamed abuse and threw things at him. In the courtroom, Sutcliffe, a man of medium build wearing a blue sweater and gray trousers, stood silently, except to answer ""yes"" to his name and ""no"" when asked if he was represented by a lawyer. Police had long suspected the killer might be a truck driver who traveled periodically to the various cities where the Ripper had struck.  They also had suspected he might work for an engineering firm because he battered and mutilated his victims with specialized work tools, including a round-headed hammer and an x-pointed screwdriver. William Clark, head of the W.H. Clark engineering firm for which Sutcliffe worked, told reporters today that police questioned him and several of his employes, including Sutcliffe, after the Ripper killed his seventh victim in October 1977 in Manchester. The police had traced a pound 5 currency note found in the handbag of the victim, a Manchester prostitute, to a West Yorkshire bank and believed it may have gone to one of Clark's employes in his pay envelope, according to Clark. ""Detectives asked us where we had been on certain dates and wanted to know our blood groups,"" Clark said today.  ""As I remember, Peter [Sutcliffe] was interviewed two or three times.  When police came to the firm, Peter showed no emotion and was quite cool."" Police today sealed off Sutcliffe's four-bedroomed, stone house in Bradford. They said they were questioning his wife Sonia, a pottery teacher, as ""a material witness."" Neighbors described the couple, who have no children, as pleasant and quiet. The woman who was with Sutcliffe in his brown Rover when he was arrested Friday night also was questioned but would not be charged, according to police officials.  After the two patrolmen making a spot check on his car discovered it had stolen license plates, they arrested Sutcliffe.  He also was charged in court today withstealing the license plates from an auto dealer. [The woman who was in the car with Sutcliffe when he was arrested was identified by police as a prostitute, United Press International reported.  She said tonight, ""I was in the car with him for about 20 minutes. rAfter only a few minutes, I realized there was something strange about him,"" UPI quoted her as saying. [""When police officers came to the car, he was very frightened.  I was glad to see the police,"" she said.  ""I was very relieved.  I am quite convinced that had they not arrived when they did, I would be dead now. . . ."" The ripper manhunt has cost several million dollars and utilized hundreds of police officers who checked out and questioned thousands of potential suspects. The case had become a obsession for West Yorkshire Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield and may have been a factor that caused him to suffer a heart attack.  The ripper taunted Oldfield in a tape recording in 1979, telling his pursuer, ""You are no nearer catching me now than four years ago."" Last November, after the ripper killed Hill in Leeds, Oldfield was replaced as head of the investigation by his deputy, James Hobson.",1981,"United Kingdom"
"437","BRITONS OUTRAGED OVER 3 RAPE CASES","West","Several unrelated cases of rape have aroused a growing controversy in Britain in the past two weeks, fueling a debate among women's organizations, legal groups and Parliament. One of the cases, the particularly brutal rape of a Glasgow woman in 1980, led to the forced resignation Thursday of Nicholas Fairbairn, the Solicitor General for Scotland. He had been vehemently criticized in the House of Commons because of a decision not to prosecute the men accused of raping the woman. In another case this month, a judge in the Ipswich Crown Court touched off a torrent of condemnation when he convicted a man of having raped a 17-year-old hitchhiker, but then gave him a $4,000 fine and no jail sentence. Among the critics of the judgment in that case was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wh o termed rape a ''violent, distateful and odiouscrime'' that called for a jail sentence in all but ''wholly exceptional s ituations.'' 'I'd Never Go to the Police' In the same statement, made in Parliament on Tuesday, Mrs.  Thatcher expressed her concern about the handling of another rape case, which was the subject of a BBC television documentary the night before. In it, a woman was shown being harshly questioned by policemen who clearly did not believe her story about being raped. Expressing a widely-held view of the program, Lynda Lee-Potter, a columnist in The Daily Mail, wrote that although she shared the policemens' skepticism about the woman's claim, it did not justify what she called the bullying way they treated her. And she quoted another young woman who had watched the program as saying: ''Did you watch that program? God, I'd never go to the police after that.' Mr. Fairbairn's resignation was agreed upon at a meeting between him and Mrs. Thatcher after th e tumultuous de bate in Parliament. In aletter to her, he defended the decision not t o prosecute the three men accused of raping the Glasgow woman, but conceded that he should not have discussed the case in the press befo re defending it to his colleagues in Parliament. Wounds Required 168 Stitches The victim in that case, who is now 30 years old, was repeatedly slashed with a razor during the attack, sustaining wounds that required 168 stitches. Mr. Fairbairn explained in the Commons that the state had decided not to prosecute the three young suspects in the case because the victim ''was not in a fit state to give evidence.'' Psychiatrists who had examined her said an appearance in court might upset her so much that she would commit suicide, he added, adding that although the crime was ''horrendous,'' no case could be made without her testimony. In the criticism from the Labor Party benches, Jo Richardson said the decision will ''give license to rapists to rape and then cut up their victims because they may then go scot-free.'' And Russel Johnston said,''To the layman, it is extraordinary that if this poor wretched woman had died as a consequence of these assaults there would have been a case brought, but because she was reduced to such a condition by the assault that she could not be in court, the people who did it go free.'' Rape Has 'Special Difficulties' In reply, Mr. Fairbairn said that if the woman had died, the men might have been prosecuted for murder, but not for rape, unless there had been witnesses. Rape has ''special difficulties which no other serious crime has,'' he said. The case of the man who was fined for raping the hitchhiker caused the greatest outcry. Judge Bertrand Richards said the victim in that case, who had been hitchhiking home in a rural area, was partly to blame. ''I am not saying that a girl hitching home late at night should not be protected by the law, but she was guilty of a great deal of contributory negligence,'' he said. The Rape Crisis Center in London said the judgment ''gives an open invitation to motorists to rape hitchhikers.'' The unusually lenient treatment of the man who committed the rape was quickly repudiated at the very highest level, not only by Mrs.  Thatcher, but also by Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, who is head of the judiciary. He turned aside the widespread demands that Judge Richards be disciplined or removed from office. But in a highly unusual rebuff a few days after the case, Lord Hailsham said, ''Contributory negligence does not, of course, constitute any defense to rape, nor in my view in the absence of actual sexual provocation should imprudence on the part of a victim operate as a factor of mitigation in the reduction of a sentence.''",1982,"United Kingdom"
"438","Photographer Sought in Manhunt; Crime-Spree Suspect Added to FBI List of Most-Wanted Fugitives","West","The FBI yesterday announced a nationwide manhunt for Christopher Bernard Wilder, a part-time photographer and Grand Prix race-car driver suspected in a six-week crime spree that includes the murder of two young women, the disappearance of four others and the kidnaping, rape and torture of a seventh. In an unusual news conference, Assistant FBI Director Oliver B. Revell said Wilder, a convicted sex offender, is being added to the bureau's list of ""Ten Most-Wanted Fugitives."" Posters with photos of Wilder have been distributed to U.S. border officials and at airports. Revell said Wilder, 39, ""represents a significant danger. He's extremely active, very dangerous, and this approach may lead to his apprehension. He's making contacts on an almost daily basis, and this is potentially a very prolific situation."" The FBI, which has jurisdiction only after a victim has been transported across state lines, entered the case two weeks ago when a Tallahassee woman was abducted and escaped in Bainbridge, Ga. She told authorities she had been raped, tortured with an electric prod and had glue poured in her eyes. A federal warrant was issued for Wilder. Wilder, a naturalized American who was born in Australia, is wanted there on kidnaping and assault charges involving two 15-year-old girls. The Australians also want to question him about 10 other cases. Police in West Palm Beach, where Wilder was convicted of sexual battery in 1980, want to talk to him about 10 additional cases. FBI sources say that other local police departments also are seeking to question Wilder. Revell said Wilder, who has no trace of an Australian accent, approaches young women in shopping malls. ""After identifying himself as a professional photographer, he comments on a young woman's appearance and attempts to persuade her to accompany him from the area for photography sessions,"" the FBI said. ""If rejected, he has beaten and forced victims to accompany him."" The first abduction of which Wilder is suspected occurred Feb. 26 in Miami. Rosario Gonzalez has not been found. On March 3, Elizabeth A. Kenyon of Miami disappeared; she, too, has not been seen again. Two weeks later, Teresa W. Ferguson disappeared from Merritt Island, Fla. Her body was found three days later. On March 23, Terry Walden of Beaumont, Tex., disappeared. Her body was found in an irrigation ditch. Six days later, Sheryl Lynn Bonaventura was kidnaped from a shopping mall in Grand Junction, Colo. She has not been found. Last Sunday, Michele Korfman disappeared from a shopping mall in Las Vegas. A man claiming to be a fashion photographer had approached several women in the area, the FBI said. Revell said the bureau does not know of Wilder's whereabouts since Sunday, but added that he might be in southern California. Police yesterday recovered Wilder's Chrysler near Beaumont.

"439","INCREASED ATTACKS ON 'BOAT PEOPLE' REPORTED","West","Refugee officials here say they have been receiving reports of a new surge in pirate attacks on Vietnamese ''boat people,'' often marked by the ramming and sinking of the vessels and the kidnapping and raping of young women. ''What it appears we are dealing with is an attempt on the part of some particularly cynical pirates to destroy evidence of their deeds,'' said Michel Barton, a press spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Although the percentage of boats attacked by pirates declined from 64 percent in 1982 to 36 percent last year, Mr. Barton said that the number remained unacceptably high and that individual cases indicated a new viciousness by the assailants. In 1984, when 24,783 refugees from Vietnam arrived in Southeast Asian ports after fleeing by sea, pirates killed 61 refugees, raped 110 women and abducted hundreds more, Mr. Barton said. In addition, he said, 130 people were confirmed as missing because of pirate attacks. So far this year, Mr. Barton said, the United Nations High Commissioner has 38 confirmed dead or unaccounted for as a result of attacks by pirates, who operate from Thailand and Malaysia. Increase in Incidents Seen United Nations officials have grown alarmed at what they say they see as a clear increase in the incidence of the ramming of boats after pirate attacks and growing evidence that a key motive of the pirates, apart from robbery, is the abduction and rape of young women, who are often passed from one pirate boat to another. ''This can last for months,'' Mr. Barton said. In one incident involving a group that fled Vietnam on March 17, Mr. Barton said, five men were thrown overboard, followed by a woman and her 2-year-old daughter, who drowned. The woman's 8-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter jumped in after their mother but survived by clinging to flotsam from the boat, which was rammed and sunk. Eight other women and children are missing, he said. Mr. Barton told of four other cases that he said United States officials had confirmed as accurate after interviews with survivors. 'Happening Right Now' ''We believe these incidents are indicative of what is happening right now on the South China Sea,'' Mr. Barton said, adding that there had been many other reports, ''some of them particularly gruesome.'' He said the United Nations would report only those cases that it is convinced actually occurred. The new wave of pirate violence might stem from growing pressure being put on the Thai and Malaysian pirates under an anti-piracy program begun in 1981. The program involves surveillance by aircraft and patrol boats of a large area of the South China Sea by specially trained Thai Navy, marine and port personnel. The program has been expanded every year. Arrests Resulted in Convictions United Nations officials say the many arrests since 1981 have resulted in 32 convictions and have acted as somewhat of a deterrent, lowering the overall number of attacks. At the same time, the officials have reported an increase in the number of Vietnamese leaving under the Orderly Departure Program established by Vietnam and the United Nations in 1979. Last year, the 29,154 Vietnamese leaving under the program surpassed the number of boat people for the first time. This year, ''for every 1,000 leaving by boat, 2,000 are leaving'' under the program, Mr. Barton said. The 2,453 boat people who arrived in Southeast Asian ports in January and February of this year represent a continuing reduction in their numbers, according to United Nations records. A total of 555,073 Vietnamese have fled by boat since 1975.",1985,"Switzerland"
"440","COURT IN CANADA RULES ON ABORTION","West","The Supreme Court ruled today that Canada's restrictive abortion law unconstitutionally interferes with a woman's right to control her own body. In a 5-to-2 decision after 16 months of deliberation, the court said the current law, which permits only ''therapeutic'' abortions approved by hospital committees, violated the fundamental justice guaranteed in the Constitution. The court said the law specifically violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms enacted in 1982. Many areas, including the province of Prince Edward Island, have no authorized hospitals for abortions. The ruling mirrors the United States Supreme Court decision in 1973 striking down a law restricting abortion. Victory for Toronto Clinic The decision today was a victory for a Toronto abortion clinic operator, Dr. Henry Morgentaler. He had asked the Supreme Court to overturn a 1985 decision by the Ontario Court of Appeal that said he had to undergo a new trial on charges of conspiring to perform illegal abortions. An Ontario Supreme Court jury acquitted Dr. Morgentaler of the conspiracy charges in 1984, but under Canadian law the prosecution can appeal. ''Bravo for the Supreme Court of Canada!'' he told reporters after the decision was announced. ''Bravo for the women of Canada!'' In the majority ruling today, Chief Justice Brian Dickson said the abortion section of Canada's Criminal Code ''clearly interferes with a woman's physical and bodily integrity.'' ''Forcing a woman by threat of criminal sanctions to carry a fetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations is a profound interference with a woman's body and thus an infringement of security of the person,'' he said. Anti-Abortion Fight Vowed The anti-abortion movement vowed to continue the fight in Parliament by pressing for new laws against abortion. Laura McArthur, president of the Right-to-Life Association of Toronto, termed the ruling a ''dastardly blow'' to unborn children. Dr. Morgentaler, 64 years old, smiled and embraced his lawyer as the verdict was read in the packed courthouse. He has been tried and acquitted on abortion charges four times in the last 18 years. He had pledged to continue the operations whatever the verdict. His clinic treats 80 women a week. About 60,000 legal abortions are performed in Canada each year.",1988,"Canada"
"441","CANADA UNNERVED BY SLAYINGS OF 14","West","Although Canada has witnessed mass killings over the years, none have involved so many deaths, or so profoundly shaken the national psyche, as the rampage this week at the University of Montreal. On Wednesday, a 25-year-old unemployed recluse, shouting ''You're all feminists!'' shot and killed 14 young women at the university's school of engineering, while wounding 13 other people, 9 of them women. Then he turned his semiautomatic hunting rifle on himself. A three-page suicide note found on the body of the gunman, Marc Lepine, along with information provided later by the police, offered a picture of a man who felt he had failed at virtually everything, from getting into graduate school to falling in love - and blamed women for it. Apart from the public shock, anger and grief expressed in candlelight vigils and lowered flags across the nation, there is also a sense of shame here over the crime: a realization that the nation may not, as many Canadians had long supposed, be somehow less vulnerable to such horrors than its neighbors in the United States. 'A Kick in the Teeth' ''This thing has been a real kick in the teeth for sanctimonious types like me,'' said Prof. Elliott Leyton of Memorial University in Newfoundland, an anthropologist who has studied mass and serial killers. ''It shows we've fully entered the modern era and no longer have anything to be smug about.'' ''When I first heard about it, I thought I was listening to something that had happened in California or New York,'' said Yuri Dayan, a cab driver who moved to Montreal from Israel 21 years ago. ''I thought, 'It's crazy - this isn't supposed to happen in Canada.' '' There has been a rush of speculation on the workings of the gunman's mind, on whether Montreal's overburdened hospitals have the counseling resources to help avert such acts, and about the effectiveness of Canada's already strict gun-control laws. The gunman was able to purchase his American-made rifle in Montreal legally a few weeks earlier because he had no criminal record. Violence Against Women Mostly, however, the incident has focused attention on the issue of sexism and violence against women. Some people, including many feminist groups, have characterized the shootings as an extreme version of a kind of male hatred that they believe has contributed to rapes, beatings and other forms of abuse of women. ''I think it's dangerous to treat this as an isolated incident,'' said Etoile Stewart, a member of the Concordia University Women's Collective, one of several student groups that sponsored a vigil at the murder scene on Thursday night. ''There are still men beating women, raping women, knifing women. Unfortunately, we live in a society where misogyny is encouraged.'' Several women students, including some who survived the massacre at the University of Montreal's engineering school, said they feared that such a mass assault could happen again -and that women studying in fields traditionally dominated by men, like engineering, could be more vulnerable. 'So Frightened, So Angry' ''Women everywhere were so frightened and so angry,'' said Jocelyne Cottier, the coordinator of the Concordia University Women's Center, a university-sponsored group that offers counseling and organizes discussion groups on women's issues. Margaret Atwood, a Canadian novelist who has explored women's issues in her work, said that the killings of the 14 women, who ranged in age from 21 to 31, ''clearly touched many people.'' But she said she hesitated to make direct comparisons with violence in the United States or Britain. ''Every society has its craziness, which takes different forms,'' she said from her home in Toronto. ''Every incident is culture-specific.'' There was no indication that Mr. Lepine had used drugs or alcohol, the police said. He shared a large apartment with his mother, a sister and a male roommate. His suicide note, written in French, included an apparent enemies list of 15 prominent Quebec women, one of whom was said to be a provincial cabinet minister. Typical but Atypical Detectives, noting that Mr. Lepine had unsuccessfully applied for admission to the University of Montreal engineering school, said he may have been enraged that women were accepted into traditionally male fields while he was not. Professor Leyton, author of the 1986 book, ''Hunting Humans: The Rise of the Modern Multiple Murderer,'' said that the gunman seemed superficially to fit the classic profile: a frustrated, lonely person from a conventional background who takes out all his aggressions in one suicidal assault. But Professor Leyton said there was a striking difference in the Montreal shooting. ''This is one of the very few mass murder cases I know of in which women were specifically targeted,'' he said.",1989,"Canada"
"442","Quebec Upholds Injunction Prohibiting an Abortion","West","The Quebec provincial appeals court yesterday upheld an injunction that prevents a 21-year-old woman from having an abortion, and her attorney said she would appeal to the country's supreme court. The ruling was the latest in a series of legal decisions that have riveted attention on the abortion issue and increased pressure on the government for an abortion law. For Chantal Daigle, a secretary who is in her 21st week of pregnancy, defying the Quebec appeals court by seeking an abortion in the United States could bring a two-year prison sentence and a $ 42,000 fine. Canada has been without an abortion law since January 1988, when the nation's supreme court said the cumbersome procedure required for approval infringed on women's rights. That ruling and a decision in a case last January decriminalized abortion and said the issue was for a woman and her doctor to decide.

"443","FOOTBALL; On Any Given Sunday, Possible Harassment","West","Tonight, with Zeke Mowatt on the Giants and Lisa Olson in Australia, the National Football League's exhibition (pun intended) season begins. Zeke and Lisa are both struggling for professional recognition and personal stability, but that's where the similarity ends. Don't forget that Zeke was the perpetrator and Lisa the victim of a disturbing incident that occurred 10 months ago in the New England Patriots' locker room, and is still widely discussed and largely unresolved. ""We call it the Zeke Mowatt incident,"" said Michele Himmelberg, a founder and past president of the Association for Women in Sports Media (the acronym is pronounced ""Awesome""), which discussed the issue at a convention this week in Newport Beach, Calif. ""Somehow, it got turned into the Lisa Olson incident, as if she was the one who caused it."" Of course, Lisa Olson caused it. She invaded the last pathetic bastion of American working-class manhood, the locker room, that caldron of testosterone where boys don't have to worry about Mom, Sis, Jennifer or Chickie putting them down, showing them up or taking their jobs. For better or worse, Zeke and Lisa (first names, please, they are human beings) will be symbolically linked forever in football history and sexual politics. According to the National Football League's public report of its own investigation, while Lisa, a 26-year-old football beat reporter for The Boston Herald, was interviewing a Patriot teammate, Zeke approached naked and, to the encouragement of several other teammates, exhibited himself in a crude and intimidating way. Had Lisa been cooler or more experienced, she might have starchily informed Zeke that she was a professional and expected him to be one, too; immediately called for backup from other reporters or, a la David Niven to a male streaker at the Oscars some years ago, made a flip remark about Zeke's ""shortcomings."" And if Lisa had been one of hundreds of male reporters who have been variously intimidated and humiliated and sometimes physically abused in locker rooms, she would have accepted it as if the shame were hers and slunk away and never told a soul. ""Sure, athletes harass reporters all the time,"" said Himmelberg, a sports reporter and columnist for The Orange County Register. ""But here's the key. Men are harassed for what they write, and we're harassed for who we are."" ""Eighteen years ago, I represented a girl who wanted to play in the Little League,"" said Karen DeCrow, of Syracuse, a lawyer and former president of the National Organization for Women. ""I remember how hysterical the coach was. He kept saying, 'If these boys strike out to a girl, their lives will be ruined forever.' ""That's the mind-set many of these pro football players grew up with. So now, here's this lousy team, feeling like losers, wimps, girls if you will, and for further humiliation, a girl is sent to write about them."" The N.F.L. is apparently trying to make more of an attempt at preparation; this season, a ""Media Relations Playbook"" and audio cassette is being sent to every player. Part of the $50,000 fine (deducted from TV profits, not collected in cash) levied against the Patriots for mishandling the Zeke Mowatt Incident paid for these materials. Last year's N.F.L. media-relations course, an eight-minute videotape narrated by football broadcaster Ahmad Rashad, began with a joking call for attention (""probably thinking about your next meal, your next day off or . . . women"") and appealed to player self-interest (""that paycheck is tied directly to the popularity of the N.F.L. and the tremendous amount of media coverage your team receives"") before briefly laying out a policy toward female reporters (""be a gentleman""). Zeke's fine, $12,500, has not been collected. An N.F.L. spokesman, Joe Browne, says it would be ""unfair"" to demand the money before Zeke's as-yet unscheduled appeal hearing is held because it would be ammunition for Lisa's civil suit against Zeke and various Patriot players and officials, including the owner, Victor Kiam, whose sniggering remarks exacerbated the incident and gave fans permission to continue harassing Lisa on the streets and in other arenas and eventually chased her to a newspaper job in Sydney, Australia. According to one of Lisa's lawyers, Norman Zalkind of Boston, the trial date is set for next March, with discovery proceedings to be completed by February. That means we can expect documents and leaks and innuendoes to brighten the coming season. And maybe even some issues to talk about: from the chilling, Why does the growing violence against women so often involve sports groups? to the silly, Why should any reporter go into the locker room? ""Fans don't understand what the locker room is; they think it's some kind of Chippendale scene, but it's dank and crowded and hot, the least sexual place I could ever think of,"" said Himmelberg. At the convention of Himmelberg's group, the longest and best-attended panel was about reporting in the locker room. ""What we've been battling with internally all year is how to walk that delicate line -- do our jobs, be a fly on the wall, take the kidding and bantering that goes with the territory but still draw the line at unprofessional conduct, at sexual harrassment,"" said Himmelberg. ""Lisa was willing to draw the line. In my personal opinion, she is a heroine.""",1991,"Australia"
"444","Canadian High Court Narrows Rape Shield Law","West","The Supreme Court of Canada ruled yesterday that the sexual history of rape victims may be offered as evidence in court at the trial judge's discretion. The 7-to-2 decision struck down part of a 1983 law shielding rape victims from intrusive questioning about their past sexual behavior. The judge may allow such evidence, the court said, where it is useful and is not being raised simply to imply that the victim was more likely to have consented to the sexual conduct or is a less believable witness. Women's groups in Canada and the United States immediately criticized the decision, saying it would discourage rape victims from reporting sexual assaults and open the door to prosecutorial harassment. ""Women once again are going to be subject to inquisitions by defense lawyers,"" said Roz Currie of the National Association of Women and the Law in Ottawa. ""I think we're going to see a dramatic decrease in the number of rapes that are reported."" Push for New Law Ms. Currie said her group would lobby the Minister of Justice for new legislation protecting women and children who are victims of sexual assault. In the United States, over the last two decades, every state has adopted a shield law generally prohibiting the introduction of evidence about a rape victim's past sexual history, with some exceptions made for previous consensual sex with the defendant, or other specific categories. But Helen Neuborne, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, said the pendulum might now be swinging back, with some states beginning to lessen victims' protection. For example, she said, in May, Massachusetts made the psychiatric background of victims admissible in certain cases. ""We're beginning to reverse the trend, with background information that casts aspersions on the victim being let in again in a way that's very dangerous, since judges and juries still tend to want to blame the victim,"" she said. ""Women find it hard enough to report crimes, so it's another stumbling block to have to worry about opening up your whole past."" The Canadian ruling came in two Ontario cases that had been joined to challenge the rape shield law. One case, that of Steven Seaboyer, involved a man charged with sexually assaulting a woman with whom he had been drinking at a bar. The second case involved Nigel Gayme, an 18-year-old who was charged with sexually assaulting a 15-year-old friend at school. Fair Trial Issue In both cases, the lawyers filed motions saying that their clients could not present a full defense because of the shield law, and were unconstitutionally being denied a fair trial. Specifically, they charged that the provisions of the shield law preventing evidence of the victim's sexual history conflicted with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the nation's 1982 analogue to the United States BIll of Rights. The charter guarantees the right to ""life, liberty and security of person"" and says that anyone charged with a crime has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty in a fair trial. Even before yesterday's decision, the rape shield law did allow the introduction of evidence concerning the victim's sexual history in a few very specific situations. But the court said that in the cases it decided yesterday, the shield law obstructed the right of the accused to a fair trial. ""In achieving its purpose -- the abolition of the outmoded, sexist-based use of sexual conduct evidence -- it overshoots the mark and renders inadmissible evidence which may be essential to the presentation of legitimate defenses and hence to a fair trial,"" wrote Justice Beverley McLachlin. ""The price is too great in relation to the benefit secured, and cannot be tolerated in a society that does not countenance in any form the conviction of the innocent,"" the opinion said. Dissenting Opinion The only other woman who sits on the court, Justice L'Heureux Dube, wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that sexual assault is different from all other crimes, that there are many myths and stereotypes surrounding rape, and that the criminal justice system often fails victims who do not fit those myths and stereotypes. Yesterday's decision left standing the half of the shield law that prevents the introduction of evidence regarding a victim's sexual reputation. That portion, too, had been challenged in the cases. The court also set forth guidelines for reviewing evidence relating to the victim's sexual history. It said the judge must first consider the proposed evidence outside the jury's hearing. And if the evidence is admitted, the judge must warn the jury against using it to infer that the victim is less credible, or was any more likely to have consented to the sexual conduct at issue. ""That's not enough to protect the women and children of Canada,"" said Ms. Currie. ""This is still a devastating blow.""",1991,"Canada"
"445","Girl, 14, Raped and Pregnant, Is Caught in Web of Irish Law","West","The case of a 14-year-old Irish rape victim barred from traveling to England to obtain an abortion has provoked a debate over how far judges and officials in Ireland can go in enforcing the nation's explicit prohibition against abortion. Today, an Irish High Court judge in Dublin affirmed an earlier court order and issued a permanent injunction forbidding the young woman to obtain an abortion in England, where the procedure is legal. Members of the Irish Parliament who are sympathetic to the girl's plight say they expect her family to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The matter has aroused concern among Irish legislators and lawyers and members of human rights and women's groups. There have been demonstrations in recent days in New York, London and Dublin. First, the Right to Travel The demonstrators argue that the action of Irish courts and Government officials not only raises troubling questions about the recourse of other rape victims who might become pregnant, but also directly interferes with the right of citizens to travel freely. Human rights groups say that as a member of the European Community, Ireland must allow its citizens to leave Ireland to obtain services legally available in another community nation. ""Pregnant women wishing to exercise their right to free movement fall within the sphere of community competence,"" said Deirdre Curtin, an expert on European law at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, who analyzed the case at length today in The Irish Times. Under an amendment to Ireland's Constitution, adopted as a result of a bitterly fought referendum in 1983, abortion is banned except in some cases where the life of the mother may be endangered. In Ireland, which is predominantly Catholic, questions of abortion and divorce always evoke strong passions. Not a New Solution Details of the girl's case have been argued in secret before the courts in recent days, and it is not known how far along her pregnancy is. Public officials involved in the matter have refused comment, but Ireland's Minister of Health was quoted in a Dublin newspaper over the weekend as saying that the girl should be persuaded ""that the baby should be born and then adopted."" Among other things, the debate has also focused attention on a well-known but seldom acknowledged recourse among Irish women, who for years have been traveling quietly to England to obtain abortions denied them in their own country. An estimated 4,000 women from Ireland traveled to England and Wales last year to obtain obtain legal abortions. About 1,800 women from Northern Ireland also traveled to England for abortions, since the 1967 Abortion Act in Britain does not extend to Northern Ireland, even though it is a province of Britain. About 180,000 legal abortions were carried out last year in England and Wales, according to Government statistics. The case has proven to be a quandary for the new Irish Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, who has been in office less than a week. His Government became entangled in the issue when Harry Whelehan, the Attorney General, acted independently last week to obtain a temporary injunction from the High Court barring the girl from traveling to Britain for the abortion. The court today affirmed the earlier injuction. Mr. Whelehan became aware of the case when the parents of the girl approached police over the planned abortion, to insure that the abortion would not destroy any evidence in the criminal case against the suspected rapist. According to Irish newspapers, Mr. Whelehan sought to intervene not because of concerns about evidence, but rather in the interest of Irish law. Under a provision of Irish law, The Irish Times reported Sunday, the attorney general is able to act as ""guardian of the public interest,"" including preserving the rights of the unborn. Despite demands from members of Parliament that he explain his decision, Mr. Whelehan has so far refused to comment. Instead, he issued a statement arguing that any public discussion would amount to contempt of court as long as the matter was still pending before judges. The Law in Britain Under British law, abortions can be legally performed on women who are up to 24 weeks pregnant, although some exceptions permit later operations. Although rape is not specifically mentioned as a justification for abortion, the law says psychological trauma to the mother should be considered. The law requires that two doctors give written consent before an abortion can be carried out. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, one of Britain's largest providers of abortions, warned the court's ruling would be ""a disaster for the women of Ireland,"" and predicted that women who are the victims of rape may now refuse to come forward, out of fear they will be punished if they later discover they are pregnant and seek an abortion. There are no reliable statistics on how many rape victims become pregnant. Of 1,432 people who contacted a rape crisis center in Dublin in 1990, for example, 52 said they had become pregnant as a result of the rape. But anti-abortion groups in London argue that pregnacy after rape is very rare. They say the girl and her family were being exploited by women's groups and others who are using their case to advance the cause of more liberal abortion laws. ""The girl and her parents have been shamefully used as publicity fodder by those seeking to change the Irish Constitution,"" said Phyllis Bowman, who is the director of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, one of Britain's largest anti-abortion groups. Mr. Whelehan was appointed the attorney general in September by Charles Haughey, Mr. Reynold's predecessor as Prime Minister. He is a former part-time marriage guidance counsellor with the Catholic Marriage Advisory Bureau. In public comments in the past, he has described himself as ""strongly opposed"" to any law that permits abortion.",1992,"Ireland"
"446","Canada Moves to Strengthen Sexual Assault Law","West","While headlines were being made by the William Kennedy Smith and Mike Tyson rape trials in the United States, a case involving many of the same complex and controversial issues was unfolding in the quiet town of Kingston in eastern Ontario. Last December, as in the case of Mr. Smith, the Kingston trial ended in acquittal, angering some women's groups. They saw the outcome as further supporting their argument that Canadian rape laws do not adequately protect the rights of women. The previous August, Canada's Supreme Court voided some protections for accusers under the nation's rape-shield law. The feeling over the issue has fueled an intense national debate about Canada's laws regarding sexual assault. It has also prompted Kim Campbell, the Minister of Justice who is the first woman to hold the post, to propose changes to the criminal code. They include an unusually restrictive definition of consensual sex. Such a definition is intended to make it easier to win convictions in rape cases. In the Kingston case, Robert VanOostrom, a 23-year-old graduate student in chemical engineering at Queen's University, was charged with sexually assaulting three female undergraduates. The women acknowledged having befriended Mr. VanOostrom, but they asserted that he had forced himself on them. Furor Over the Verdict Mr. VanOostrom's lawyer, Brian H. Greenspan, built a case around the contention that the women, carried away by rising anxieties about date rape that have swept Canadian campuses recently, had recast their relationships with the defendant to make consensual sex seem like rape. The defense created a furor. As Mr. VanOostrom left the courthouse after his acquittal, a crowd of women rocked his car, shouted ""Guilty!"" and spray-painted slogans, including ""Stop Rape, Stop Rob,"" on the courthouse steps. The anger has been fueled nationwide by reports of cases in which men with a history of sexual violence and who were free on bail or parole have sexually attacked and killed women.  The uproar has been further stoked by recent statistics showing that people convicted of crimes in the least serious category of sexual offenses get lighter sentences, on average, than are given to people who have been convicted of burglary. The reported incidence of sexual assault in Canada has risen sharply. The Ministry of Justice said there were 29,111 cases in 1988, more than double the 12,848 cases recorded in 1982. Figures for that six-year span were the most recent for which statistics were widely available. Legislative Changes Sought Members of women's groups, criminologists, sociologists and others urging stronger measures were heartened in December when Minister Campbell proposed a package of legislative changes to the criminal code's provisions on rape. At the core of the new bill, the legal definition of sexual consent would have the effect of eliminating, or sharply narrowing, some of the pleas used by defendants who have won acquittal in rape cases. One major provision would require that defendants show that they took ""all reasonable steps"" to affirm an accuser's consent. Other provisions would restore protections for accusers under parts of the rape-shield law that were voided last August. In the United States, rape laws vary considerably by state, with the strictest laws still requiring a demonstration of a show of force, and the most liberal making it a crime to have sexual intercourse with a woman without her consent. But prosecutors in states with the most liberal laws said that as a practical matter it would be difficult to win a conviction in a case in which a woman had remained silent and had not resisted intercourse. In Canada, while the new bill awaits study by a parliamentary committee, a storm has broken over Ms. Campbell, a 44-year-old lawyer from Vancouver. Strong objections have been raised by groups representing criminal lawyers as well as by editorial writers and columnists. They have objected in particular to provisions that deal with drinking and drugs. For example, one provision stipulates that a defendant in a sexual assault trial could not claim to have had consent if the accuser in the case was ""incapable of consenting to the activity by reason of intoxication or other condition."" Ridiculing such provisions, Mr. Greenspan, the lawyer who won Mr. VanOostrom's acquittal and who is president of the Criminal Lawyers' Association of Ontario, said in an interview that Canadian men might have to travel with portable breathalyzers to be able to determine the sobriety of potential sexual partners. Critics have also focused on the bill's requirement that a defendant in a rape case demonstrate that he took ""all reasonable steps"" to ascertain that he had obtained his partner's consent. To critics like Mr. Greenspan, this is unrealistic in view of the inexplicit manner in which many men and women move toward having sex. He said it might mean that they would have to interrupt their passion to deal with the matter of consent. ""In the end, I know of no way of doing that other than actively seeking a 'yes,' "" Mr. Greenspan said. Another section of the bill has potentially far-reaching implications for executives, professors and others who have sexual relationships with people who work or study under their authority. As proposed, the section would not allow a defendant to argue that sex was consensual in cases in which his accuser is shown to have engaged in sexual activity ""by reason of the accused's abuse of a position of trust or authority."" For example, some criminal lawyers have said, the clause could open the way for malicious rape prosecutions by women who willingly engaged in sex with their bosses and were later spurned. In such instances, the lawyers said, the cases could turn on a assertion by a woman that she was afraid to refuse a man's advances, regardless of whether the prosecution was able to demonstrate that she was coerced. Ms. Campbell hastened the drafting of the new bill after the Court's decision last August to void part of the 1983 rape-shield law. In its ruling, the Court struck down a provision in the law that restricted evidence about an accuser's past sexual activities to matters involving previous sexual relations with the defendant. Delving Into Accuser's Past The Minister, who had strongly opposed allowing courts to delve into accusers' sexual histories, includedprovisions in the bill that would enforce the Court's ruling while limiting its repercussions. The bill offers strict guidelines for judges in determining which, if any, evidence about an accuser's past could be admitted at trial. Lawyers seeking to present evidence about an accuser's past would have to do so in a closed hearing with the jury absent. A defense move to introduce such evidence would have to deal with a specific instance of sexual activity, not a pattern of behavior. The bill also provides that an accuser cannot be compelled to appear or testify at the evidence hearing.",1992,"Canada"
"447","Neo-Nazi Asks Forgiveness for Death of Turks","West","The oldest of four youths accused of murdering five Turkish women and girls in an arson attack last May asked for forgiveness today as the trial began in the worst hate crime since the reunification of Germany in 1990. Markus Gartmann, 24, is the only defendant known to belong to a neo-Nazi group. He and the three others are charged with setting a fire that killed the women and girls while they slept in their home in Solingen, a western industrial city in the Ruhr region. ""I can't stop being sorry for what we've done, and I am infinitely ashamed,"" said Mr. Gartmann, who initially confessed to involvement in the May 29 arson after a nervous breakdown in prison. His apology to relatives of the women and girls -- ages 4 through 27 -- was barely audible. Mr. Gartmann told the court of a life of drinking and failed attempts to hold a job, of carousing with rightist friends in combat boots and bomber jackets, of resenting foreigners. But Mr. Gartmann said he thought things over in jail. ""I think that the slogans of the rightists lead to hate and inhumanity and we are all the result of this,"" he declared. Kamil Genc, who lost two daughters, two sisters and a cousin in the firebombing, winced at Mr. Gartmann's words. Tears came to his eyes and he comforted his mother. The court also heard the lawyer for Felix Kohnen, the youngest defendant, predict that Mr. Kohnen, 16, and Christian Buchholz, 21, would go free, arguing prosecutors erred in their haste to make arrests. The fourth defendant, Christian Riher, 17, told the six-judge Higher Regional Court he would not be testifying during the trial, which is expected to run until October. The four are charged with 5 counts of murder, 14 of attempted murder and one of arson.",1994,"Germany"
"448","Bangladesh Writer, Threatened With Death, Flees to Sweden","West","A feminist Bangladeshi writer under a death threat from Islamic militants fled today to Sweden and immediately went into hiding. The writer, Taslima Nasrin, spent two months in hiding in Bangladesh, where Muslim fundamentalists were infuriated by a newspaper article that quoted her as urging a revision of the Koran. Militant groups have offered a $5,000 reward for her death. Ms. Nasrin, 32, has said she was misquoted. But she has called for changes in strict rules that prevent many women in Bangladesh from activity outside the home. ""I've come to Sweden"" to ""rest and work,"" the author said in a statement distributed by Sweden's branch of the PEN international writers' organization, which is acting as her host. Court Grants Her Bail Swedish Government officials welcomed Ms. Nasrin, whose plight has drawn comparisons with Salman Rushdie's years in seclusion when under an Iranian death threat. Culture Minister Birgit Friggebo said the author was ""forced to leave her country for using her natural rights to write and say whatever she wants."" Ms. Nasrin is charged by a Bangladeshi court with offending the religious sentiment of Muslims, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison. She surrendered to the authorities on Aug. 3. She was granted bail and permission to visit other countries as long as she informed the judge of her plans and whereabouts. No trial date has been set. In Bangladesh, fundamentalist groups denounced the Government for letting Ms. Nasrin leave. ""If the Government fails to bring her back to the country and put her on trial, the people will topple the Government and put its leaders on trial for betraying the cause of Islam,"" said Shafiul Alam Prodhan, a spokesman for a coalition of 13 fundamentalist groups. Abdul Kader Mollah, a spokesman for Bangladesh's leading fundamentalist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, said the Government would ""have to pay a very heavy price"" for letting Ms. Nasrin go. The Government said that Ms. Nasrin acted within her legal rights. ""She was free to go anywhere she liked and that's what she did,"" the Bangladeshi Home Secretary, Azimuddin Ahmed, said. Traveling on a tourist visa, Ms. Nasrin arrived in Stockholm around midday. The Swedish Foreign Minister, Margaretha af Ugglas, said Ms. Nasrin was staying at a ""secret place,"" but refused to give any other information about her arrival. Norway Considering Asylum It was uncertain how long Ms. Nasrin would stay in Sweden. She has been invited to attend a writers' conference next month in Norway, where the Government has said it will consider offering her asylum. Asked whether Sweden also might offer Ms. Nasrin asylum, the Swedish Government said it was up to the author to decide whether to apply. The Swedish branch of PEN had invited Ms. Nasrun to visit the country last spring, according to the Swedish news agency TT. The branch also supported Mr. Rushdie, the Indian-born author who has been in hiding since 1989, when Iran declared his novel ""The Satanic Verses"" blasphemous to Islam and put a bounty on his head. On a recent visit to Oslo, Mr. Rushdie spoke on behalf of Ms. Nasrin and criticized the Bangladeshi authorities for not standing up to fundamentalists. Ms. Nasrin, who is also a doctor, angered many Muslim fundamentalists last year with her novel ""Shame,"" which depicted Muslim persecution of Bangladesh's Hindu minority. She has written extensively in newspapers and books advocating greater freedom for women in the predominately Muslim country.",1994,"Sweden"
"449","An Irish Judge Fuels Debate Over Abortion","West","The already emotional debate over Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion accelerated today as the man imprisoned in a landmark 1992 case had his sentence reduced. In the case, a 14-year-old had sought an abortion in Britain, saying that the father of a friend had made her pregnant. The Government ordered her not to have the abortion. The Supreme Court overruled the Government, and last June the man, who has never been identified, was convicted of unlawful carnal knowledge and indecent assault, and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Today, a Criminal Court of Appeals Judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, reduced the sentence to four years, explaining that no duress had been used, that the case was not one of rape, and that the man was contrite and unlikely to repeat such crimes. The decision evoked outrage from groups representing children's and women's rights and in the lower house of Parliament in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country. Mary Henry, a physician active in women's issues and a proponent of a liberalization of the ban on abortion, criticized the ""no duress"" statement by the judge, saying that a child had no power to resist advances by an adult. In Parliament, the Justice Minister, Nora Owen, said that the Government had no authority to appeal the man's sentence. As the news of the ruling broke, the Senate had just given final approval to a measure guaranteeing women the right to information on abortion clinics abroad. Abortion is only legal in Ireland when the life of the mother is in danger; an estimated 5,000 Irish women go to Britain annually for abortions. The measure passed today is expected to go to President Mary Robinson for a decision whether it should be sent to the Supreme Court for a test of its constitutionality. The case of the girl and her assailant led to a referendum in 1992 that established the right of women to travel abroad for abortions, and to abortion information.",1995,"Ireland"
"450","University Comes Down Hard on Bias, Setting Off a Debate Across Canada","West","Taking extraordinary action to counter charges of sexism and racism in the classroom, the University of British Columbia has halted admissions to its graduate political science program until it can improve the department's social climate. The action has touched off a rousing debate in Canada about harassment and academic freedom. It was applauded by women and minority groups but seen by some others as defaming an entire department and chilling academic discourse. Reacting to a report that criticized the university for failing to act against the widespread allegations of discrimination in the political science department, David Strangway, the university president, ordered on June 21 that no more graduate students be admitted to the program until its social climate improves. ""The suspension will remain in effect,"" he said in his order, ""until there are satisfactory provisions in place relating to educational equity and a learning and working environment that is free from harassment and discrimination."" The university, with 32,000 students and 2,000 teachers, is Canada's third largest, after the University of Toronto and McGill in Montreal. This year, the department had 73 graduate students and 25 professors. The action is likely to eliminate or severely reduce a new graduate class in the 1996-97 academic year, if not longer. New students already registered for this September will be admitted. But they have been sent copies of the report, and university officials suggested that some may elect not to come as a result of its findings. The dean of arts and the dean of graduate studies have been asked to address the concerns and to file a report by Dec. 31. The report -- a 174-page enumeration of student allegations of racist attitudes and ""sexual terrorism"" by the faculty members in the department, most of them white men -- touched off the dramatic move by Mr. Strangway. ""I can't think of any precedent for such a step,"" said Dr. Donald C. Savage, executive director of the Canadian Association of University Teachers. Bernice Sandler, senior scholar in residence at the National Association for Women in Education in Washington, said that even in academic circles in the United States the events in British Columbia were being monitored closely. The report gave the most attention to comments by an unnamed professor, who allegedly told his teaching assistant, a master of arts candidate ""of color,"" after she had issued her first grades to undergraduates, ""Yeah, now they probably think that you are just one big, bad, black bitch."" The assistant, described in the report as ""shocked and horrified,"" made a formal complaint and later demanded $40,000 for refunded and continued tuition and expenses and the right to choose the scholars on the committee that would judge her master's thesis. The university rejected the demands, but the conflict heated up to a point where the university called for an independent inquiry. It selected Joan McEwen, a Vancouver lawyer who is a specialist on the issue of sexual harassment. While no one was actually called on the carpet at the university, Dr. Savage and Tony Sheppard, a tenured law professor who is president of the faculty association, pointed out that the highly public suspension has inevitably put the entire department under a cloud. The professor who was alleged to have made the remark to the master's candidate is no longer with the university, but officials insist that his dismissal had nothing to do with the episode. He was untenured and knew nine months before the event that his contract would not be renewed, said Steve Crombie, associate director of university relations. Ms. McEwan interviewed 225 faculty members and students over a 10-month period for her report, which included complaints that the faculty is dominated by white males and that most doctoral candidates are men. Without supplying corroborating evidence, the report cited a number of charges of improper behavior, from posting crude cartoons on office doors to provocative questioning during oral exams. ""The response of the university in respect of those allegations has been inadequate,"" Ms. McEwen wrote. But Mr. Sheppard faulted the report for failure to provide evidence to support the complaints. ""Why is it necessary to close admissions in the first place?"" he said. ""The innocent are suffering."" In the national debate, The Globe and Mail of Toronto weighed in with an unusually strong censure of the report and the suspension. ""One day, long ago, universities were considered bastions of free speech and open inquiry,"" it said. ""If U.B.C.'s experience is any guide, they are now the site of the most cringing conformity."" But Miche Hill, program coordinator for the Vancouver Status of Women, a group promoting women's equality, disagreed. ""Obviously there's a major problem with sexism at the university,"" she said. ""And this was a good start at dealing with it.""",1995,"Canada"
"451","World News Briefs; 2 More Victims Found In Belgian Sex-Abuse Case","West","Authorities found the remains of two young women under a garden shed today and said they were the third and fourth victims found in a deadly pornography ring. The bodies were identified as Eefje Lambrecks, 17, and An Marchal, 20, who vanished on vacation in the North Sea town of Ostend in August 1995, the police said. A convicted rapist, Marc Dutroux, who has already been charged in the abduction of two 8-year-old girls found starved to death in the basement of a home he owned, had confessed to kidnapping the two young women. The police found the remains under the concrete floor of a shed next to a house owned by Mr. Dutroux near the southern city of Charleroi. The badly decomposed bodies were taken away for autopsy. Two schoolgirls, who said they had been sexually abused, were released last month from one of several houses Mr. Dutroux owned around Charleroi, prompting the search for other missing children who may have fallen victim to what the police say was a gang of child pornographers. Mr. Dutroux's wife and a police detective are among eight others arrested in the case. The remains found today were next to a house once occupied by Bernard Weinstein, a Frenchman believed to have been Mr. Dutroux's accomplice. Mr. Dutroux has confessed to killing Mr. Weinstein, whose body was discovered last month, the police said.",1996,"Belgium"
"452","Grief Stirred By a Sex Case Grips Belgium At 2 Burials","West","With grief glaringly public and intensely private, the people of this town today buried two victims of a sex-crimes case that has confronted Belgium with unaccustomed self-doubt, anger and fear. In separate services on a quiet, sunny Saturday two young women, Eefje Lambrecks, 19, and An Marchal, 17, who had been missing for more than a year, were laid to rest here. Their bodies were discovered this week on the grounds of a house in Charleroi owned by an associate of Marc Dutroux, who is the chief suspect in the case. Mr. Dutroux is a convicted rapist of minors who has acknowledged abducting the young women. He has also said that he killed an accomplice. Mr. Dutroux, a 36-year-old unemployed electrician, owned or visited several houses where, since Aug. 15, two sexually abused young girls have been rescued from a makeshift dungeon and two abducted 8-year-olds were found starved to death. Ten people have been arrested in connection with the cases, including a senior police officer. On Friday the police began digging for bodies at a house in Waterloo owned by Mr. Dutroux's mother-in-law, searching for clues to the whereabouts of seven other girls reported missing in recent years. ""Never in my life has there been anything like this in Belgium,"" said Pol Vanspouwen, 83, a retired railroad engineer. Like others, he filed through Hasselt's 17th-century Town Hall today to record condolences in volumes whose messages chronicle a sense of betrayal and helplessness among people who thought their society immune to such horror. ""On this day I feel that justice failed, that as a police officer in Hasselt, I failed personally,"" Patrick Konings, a local policeman, wrote. ""I carry this with me every day and I pray it will never happen again."" An Gijbels, a classmate of Miss Marchal, who disappeared on a school visit to the resort of Ostend with Miss Lambrecks on Aug. 23, 1995, said: ""I don't know what to write. I cannot even help in your sorrow."" Sabine Decoutere also came to the Town Hall today with her daughter Lisbeth, 10. ""Justice failed,"" Mrs. Decoutere said. ""The whole apparatus failed."" She was angry, like many other Belgians, over the fact that Mr. Dutroux was released from prison in 1992 after serving 3 years of a 13-year sentence for the rape of 5 children. ""No one feels safe anymore,"" she said. ""The children used to go and play by themselves in Belgium. All that's finished now."" A 22-year-old student, Debrone Els, said: ""There's a lot of insecurity. You don't want to go anywhere by yourself anymore."" The killings have spread unease across Europe that Mr. Dutroux was part of a pedophile sex ring that had wider dimensions. The Austrian police, who arrested four suspected pedophiles this week, suspect that a child-sex ring is centered in Slovakia.  Here, barely a conversation or an encounter goes by without reference to the Dutroux case, which has filled newspapers and television screens with details of abuse and cruelty. Hundreds of people filed in charged silence into Hasselt's ancient St. Quintinus Cathedral this afternoon for the service for Miss Marchal -- broadcast across the nation in peak hours usually reserved for Saturday sports programs -- after a private service for Miss Lambrecks in a suburban Roman Catholic church this morning. But the acrimony surrounding the investigation intruded. Miss Marchal's family, which has accused the authorities of mishandling and possibly obstructing investigations into their daughter's disappearance, refused to allow some local officials to sit in the cathedral.",1996,"Belgium"
"453","Nova Scotia Ex-Premier Is Cleared of Charges of Rape in 1950's","West","The former premier of Nova Scotia was acquitted today of eight charges of rape, attempted rape and indecent assault related to incidents that allegedly took place 40 years ago. The former premier, Gerald Regan, now 70, led the province's government from 1970 to 1978. He was also a member of the federal Parliament and a Cabinet minister under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. ""It's been a long, long ordeal,"" he said after hearing the jury's decision. ""We've lived and died with this for the last five years."" A jury of six women and four men deliberated about eight hours before returning the not-guilty verdict in a Halifax courtroom this afternoon. But it was only after the jury had been sequestered Thursday night that it became known that besides the three women who had testified during the trial, 19 other women had told investigators they had been sexually assaulted or harassed by Mr. Regan years ago. The judge, Michael MacDonald, blocked attempts by prosecutors to allow some of the other alleged victims to testify, and limited this trial to just the charges brought by three women. The judge also issued a publication ban, which prevented any information about the other cases from being reported during the trial. The trial of Mr. Regan, a respected public figure in Nova Scotia, was one of the most sensational proceedings in Canada in recent years. It brought calls from some quarters for a statute of limitations on criminal charges. The trial also forced Canadians to try to reconcile two starkly different images of a man who had spent most of his adult life in public service. Mr. Regan, a tall, stately man, was always formal and polite as, dressed in a dark suit and tie, he marched into and out of the Halifax courthouse. Inside the courtroom, however, the prosecution and three alleged victims portrayed him as a brutal rapist and sexual predator who enjoyed watching his victims cringe in fear. It came down to Mr. Regan's word against the moving testimony of the alleged victims. The accusers, now middle-aged women, said they were teen-agers when the attacks took place, often after Mr. Regan had parked his car in an isolated area. The women all said they knew him then but not intimately. Mr. Regan steadfastly denied making advances to the women. Throughout the trial, his wife, Carole, 62, defended him against the accusations. The crown prosecutor, Adrian Reid, told the jury that despite Mr. Regan's gentlemanly demeanor and public reputation, he had ""a dark side"" that led him to prey on young women. The jury's acquittal was a stinging loss for the prosecution, which had spent five years on the case. ""If there are grounds for appeal, we'll consider them,"" Mr. Reid told reporters. But Mr. Regan's lawyer, Edward Greenspan, said that prosecutors were off base from the moment the investigation had been launched. ""If he had not been the former premier of this province they would never have spent millions of dollars pursuing him,"" Mr. Greenspan said. ""It just wouldn't have happened to an ordinary citizen."" Mr. Regan's troubles have not ended. He is scheduled to appear in court again next February, when proceedings begin on another sex complaint.",1998,"Canada"
"454","8-Year Sentence in France for Genital Cutting","West","A Paris court has sentenced an African woman to eight years in prison for cutting the genitals of 48 girls between the ages of a month and 10 years. The jury also convicted 27 parents, who received suspended sentences from three to five years. The trial was the largest of its kind in France, which began to prosecute genital cutting in 1991. Lawyers said the unexpectedly tough sentence was a new and clear warning to France's large African immigrant population that their painful tradition will not be tolerated here because it violates the law against ""mutilation"" of a minor. The ritual cutting of young girls' genitals has become an issue throughout Western Europe as the number of African immigrants who practice it has grown, though France is the first country to take them to court. In this and previous trials, prosecutors have described the custom -- widespread in some Muslim countries -- as a barbaric habit that aims to control women by reducing or preventing their sexual pleasure. The practice involves cutting off all or part of a young girl's clitoris and labia and sometimes stitching her vagina closed until marriage. Doctors testified in court that the procedure often causes infections and painful scars and may lead to lifelong health complications. This case, on which the court ruled on Tuesday, has drawn much public attention because it was brought by a victim, Mariatou Koita, 23, a Parisian law student from a Malian family. She went to a Paris judge four years ago to accuse Hawa Greou, who she said had cut her and her sisters when they were children. Ms. Greou, 53, who is also from Mali, acknowledged the cutting and apologized at the beginning of the trial, saying she had intended to perform a service, not to do harm. She charged $30 to $80. The parents of the 48 children cut by Ms. Greou were tried as accomplices. Most were from Gambia, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. Some argued that they had had their girls cut to make sure that they would get husbands when they grew up. http://www.nytimes.com",1999,"France"

When a television documentary team asked him about Justice for Women, the group that wants him banned from Britain because of his 1992 rape conviction in Indiana, he responded, ""They are just a bunch of frustrated women who want to be men."" Tyson has also had trouble with the law over his early-morning jogging. For three straight days, Tyson has run in Hyde Park to avoid the daytime crowds that trail him. But that is in violation of a regulation that makes entering the Royal parks after midnight a criminal offense carrying a fine of $320.

"456","PLUS: BOXING -- HEAVYWEIGHTS; Protesters Greet Tyson in London","West","Mike Tyson arrived in Britain yesterday with yet another fight on his hands -- from a women's group that wants him barred from the country because of his rape conviction. The former heavyweight champion is to face Julius Francis on Jan. 29 in Manchester. On Thursday, the British government said Tyson could enter England despite the 1992 conviction. As Tyson's Concorde landed at Heathrow Airport outside London, anti-rape protesters said they were ready to ask the High Court to review the government's decision with an eye toward stopping the fight. Tyson, shielded by dozens of police officers and security guards, was engulfed by a crowd of some 400 people as he was swept through the airport and stepped into a black Mercedes. The crush around Tyson was so intense that one man was shoved into the boxer's limousine. A woman was knocked to the ground but was reported uninjured. Justice for Women, a group that campaigns against domestic violence and sexual assault, intends to argue that Home Secretary Jack Straw exceeded his powers by overriding immigration rules.

"457","Long Nomads, the Inuit Find a Settled Life Unsettling","West","In this brand new territory, where new government buildings rise on nameless muddy streets, people had barely learned that the former speaker of the legislature had been convicted of sexual assault when they heard today that their education minister had been charged with beating up a woman. This dual attack on the pride of this 17-month-old territory seemed to highlight the rocky cultural transition of the Inuit, who compose 85 percent of Nunavut's 27,000 residents. Telescoping centuries of sociological change into two generations, the Inuit, known as Eskimos in Alaska and Greenland, have moved from the life of nomadic hunters who survived for centuries in one of the world's harshest environments to a modern, sedentary life marked by snowmobiles, heated homes and satellite television. One price for this wrenching change has been Canada's highest rate of violent crime, with one attack reported each year for every 19 residents. Last year Nunavut registered 204 sexual assaults, about 10 times the national per-capita average, and 1,115 assaults, nearly six times the national average. In the past, when attacks on women were debated, callers to radio stations sometimes criticized women's shelters for interfering in traditional family life. Elders reminded listeners that in traditional Inuit society, a man was allowed to beat his wife if she lied to him, was unfaithful or talked too much. ""Men would call in and say, 'The shelters are ruining my marriage,' "" said the wife of a territorial minister. ""Older women would say: 'I was beaten. If we talk too much, we are beaten.' "" But now younger Inuit, separated by a generation or more from the harsh life of surviving in a wilderness of snow and ice, are saying Inuit should adapt their relations to their new lives in houses and villages. ""We as an Inuit nation need to sit down and reflect,"" said Simona Arnatsiaq, women's program coordinator of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association. ""There has been so much change in 50 years. We used to live as families in camps. Now we live in settled communities. We have to discuss getting along in large groups."" Across this vast territory, three times the size of Texas, alcoholism, high unemployment and crowded housing contribute to high rates of sexual assault. Noting that there are two people per room in the territory, twice the national average, Ann Roberts, the chief medical officer, said, ""With the drinking, the ennui, the crowded housing stock -- this is the recipe for sexual assault."" For territorial legislators, who have some of the highest-paying jobs in the Arctic, the problem may stem from alcohol mixed with domineering attitudes about women. But even with two members now charged in cases of violence against women, there has been mostly silence from the 19-member Legislative Assembly, 18 of whom are men. Although women across Nunavut have started signing protest petitions, there has been little public reaction from Peter Kattuck, the minister responsible for the status of women. From Rankin Inlet, Nunavut's second-largest town, Evelyn Thordarson, director of the women's shelter, said of members of the Assembly, ""When you go, you take an oath to serve the people, not to harm the people, not to break the law."" Last March, in the first blow to the Assembly, the police arrested Levi Barnabas, the 36-year-old speaker, and charged him with sexual assault. According to the police, Mr. Barnabas, after a night of heavy drinking, tried to have sex with a friend's wife at a house here. The woman resisted and woke up her husband, who chased the legislator into the street, hitting him three times with a baseball bat. Two weeks ago, Mr. Barnabas was found guilty and received a one-year jail sentence, which was suspended on the condition that he pay $1,000 to the women's shelter here, perform 240 hours of community service and stay out of Iqaluit's two bars for six months. Under pressure from the Assembly's leaders, Mr. Barnabas resigned his seat. But the politician, who has represented Canada's northernmost Arctic villages for the last five years, before and after the creation of Nunavut, soon announced that constituents were urging him to run in the special election for his seat. ""With the Levi Barnabas case, people are seeing this and asking: 'What is the point of bringing charges? He only got community hours,' "" Ms. Thordason said. Newspaper editorialists say the Assembly, through its silence, is sending out a message of male impunity. ""The male-dominated legislature has been strangely silent over the issue,"" News North Nunavut, a weekly, wrote in an editorial Monday. ""The government had a golden opportunity to take a stand against violence directed at women. Their silence trivialized the severity of Barnabas's crime."" But this week's case may make addressing the issue of violence against women unavoidable. On Saturday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers arrested James Arvaluk, 52, the education minister, and charged him with assault. The police say the victim was a woman at his home in Coral Harbor, about 435 miles west of here. In 1995, when Mr. Arvaluk represented that area in the legislature of the Northwest Territories, he spent time in jail after being convicted of two charges of sexual assault. ""People were having trouble with him as minister of education with the sexual assault conviction,"" said the wife of another minister. ""Now this charge involves bringing booze into a dry community."" When the Legislative Assembly resumes session in mid-October, Ms. Arnatsiaq said, the first order of business should be to set an example by adopting a code of ethics and a policy of zero tolerance among members for assaults on women.  http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Canada"
"458","Where Hit Men Better Mean It When They 'Yes, Ma'am' the Boss","West","The police in Naples arrested the wife of a jailed mob boss today, a fresh sign that Italian women have broken through the glass ceiling of the organized crime business at least. The woman, Carmela Marzano, whose husband, Luigi Giuliano, was a top boss of a clan inside the Camorra crime network until he was jailed in the early 1990's, appears to have taken over some of her husband's duties in his absence. She was charged with threatening the widow of a rival mobster who wanted to testify against Ms. Marzano's son-in-law and two associates accused of murdering her husband in 1999. Ms. Marzano's daughter, Marianna, was also arrested. The arrest of Ms. Marzano came only a few weeks after that of a reputedly even more powerful female boss, Erminia Giuliano, the sister of Ms. Marzano's husband. Investigators say she took over the Giuliano family crime business after all five of her brothers were arrested.  When her arrest was announced, Italy's minister of the interior, Enzo Bianco, called it ""a lovely Christmas present for the security of Naples."" But one of her chief rivals, Maria Licciardi, the sister and heir-apparent of a deceased Camorra crime boss who the police say leads one of the most violent and entrenched Camorra factions, is still on the lam. Locally, Ms. Licciardi is known as the Camorra Princess. The stereotype of the mob wife -- loyal, deferential and tight-lipped -- began changing when the role of women in organized crime became more prominent, most noticeably as targets of mob-style hits as old honor codes protecting women and children broke down. The emergence of women as bosses is far more noticeable in Naples than Sicily. The police say it is partly a cultural thing. ""Family ties are very tight here, and women have always had a far more dominant role in the family here than in Sicily,"" said Giuseppe Donno, a spokesman for the police department of the province of Naples. ""They say that behind every great man there is a strong woman, and that is true in crime families as well."" Even in Naples, the sudden emergence of women as bosses is less a reflection of their new empowerment and ruthlessness than a drain of manpower, with women being drafted to replace male relatives in jail or killed in clan rivalries. The nature of the Camorra organization, a welter of competing clans far less structured and centralized than the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, is another reason. Without a strong cupola, or overlord, to impose order, clans fall back on close relatives, even wives and sisters, to fill power vacuums. But not without some gender warfare. The story behind Ms. Marzano's arrest suggests the kind of fierce rivalries even between family members within the Camorra network, and also a latent machismo. She is accused of helping her daughter's husband, Michele Mazzarella, avoid a conviction in the 1999 murder of Giuseppe Ginosa, who, according to police reports, was blocking Mr. Mazzarella's efforts to take over the Giuliano crime family's territory from, among others, Erminia Giuliano. And she became the boss because the only direct male heir to the family business still at liberty, Pio Vittorio Giuliano, a nephew, was deemed inept. As a Naples police report put it, ""He wanted to become the capo, but he lacked the necessary qualities and was not much respected in the family.""",2001,"Italy"
"459","A Landmark Ruling on Rape","West","The conviction this week by the Hague war crimes court of three Bosnian Serbs for rape and sexual enslavement marks the first time an international tribunal has convicted defendants exclusively for sexual violence or prosecuted sexual slavery at all. The decision shows the progress that women's issues have made in international justice, which used to ignore mass rape, considering it a natural occurrence in war. The tribunal's verdict should also encourage individual nations to treat sexual violence more seriously. The three Serbs were commanders in the Bosnian town of Foca in 1992 and 1993, where hundreds of women were abducted and sexually enslaved by Bosnian Serb soldiers. Women and girls as young as 12 were kept for months and subjected to repeated rape. Some were rented or sold to other soldiers. All three defendants were convicted of rape and torture, and two of them were convicted of enslaving the women. The men received prison terms of 28, 20 and 12 years. The three-judge panel ruled that rape had been used as an instrument of terror. Significantly, the judges ruled that mass rape is a crime against humanity, the second most serious category of international crimes after genocide. Forced prostitution, though common in the Far East during World War II, was never prosecuted in the international tribunals that followed the war. Although the ensuing 50 years have seen a dramatic expansion in women's legal rights, mass rape was almost completely ignored in the Hague court's counterpart tribunal for Rwanda for its first four years of existence. Only the prodding of the sole female judge forced prosecutors to go back and investigate rape, and hire female investigators. The tribunal for Yugoslavia, based in The Hague, has treated rape more seriously, in part due to persistent lobbying by women's groups. In addition, crimes like those committed in Foca were a major reason for the world's outrage over Bosnia, which led to the establishment of the tribunal. The Hague prosecutor has a legal adviser for sexual crimes, and a large proportion of the tribunal's indictments include sexual violence. Even so, the Hague tribunal also has only one woman judge. Both need more. One of the most important roles played by the Hague and other international tribunals is that of global legal model. The Nuremberg principle that following an illegal order is no defense, for example, has been incorporated into the laws of most major nations. There is probably no area of law more deficient in more places than that concerning the protection of women's rights. The tribunal's energetic prosecution and strong legal condemnation of rape and sexual slavery should inspire nations around the world to be more vigilant about defending women's rights through the enactment of strong laws and their vigorous enforcement.",2001,"Netherlands"

"462","Spain Sentences Imam for Book Offering Advice on Wife-Beating","West","A Muslim spiritual leader who wrote a book telling Muslim men how to beat their wives was sentenced to 15 months in prison for encouraging violence against women, a court in Barcelona announced Wednesday. In his 120-page book, ""Women in Islam,"" Mohamed Kamal Mustafa, imam of the southern Spanish town of Fuengirola, urged husbands not to hit their wives on sensitive parts of the body or with force but, rather, ""on hands and feet, using a light rod so that the blows don't leave scars or bruises,"" according to the sentencing document, dated Monday and released Wednesday. Mr. Mustafa's lawyer argued that the book, distributed in Islamic bookstores in Barcelona, merely rehashed versions of Islamic writings from the 13th to 19th centuries and did not represent the imam's personal views. ""Freedom of expression wasn't the right argument, it was freedom of religion that had to be protected,"" said the lawyer, Jose Luis Bravo Garcia. In the decision, however, Judge Juan Pedro Yllanes stated that the book was ""infused with a tone of obsolete machismo,"" and that it violated the constitutional ""principle of equality"" and promoted ""intolerable"" discrimination against women, outweighing the guarantee of religious freedom. The passages on wife-beating, he said, are ""incompatible with the reigning social mores, even if we must remember that the treatment of women in this country was very similar in a not too distant past."" It is the first verdict in Spain that recognizes ""incitement to violence on the basis of gender"" as a crime, according to a prominent feminist lawyer, Maria Jose Varela, who represented the three Spanish women's rights federations that filed the lawsuit over the book in July 2000. ""We showed that Islam had evolved, and that the imam can't shield himself behind religious texts from medieval times,"" she said, noting that Spanish Muslim women testified at the trial about the evolution of women's rights in contemporary Islam. The verdict comes as Spain's European neighbors struggle to find a balance between freedom of religion and women's rights in a secular society. But while a French law to ban head scarves and other overt religious symbols in public schools set off protests, several representatives of Spain's diverse Muslim community supported the verdict issued Wednesday. ""We respect the sentence,"" said Mohamed Halhoul, director of the Islamic Council of Catalonia. ""In Islam, there does not exist any type of call for aggression, either towards men or women."" Jadicha Candela, president of an association of Muslim women, hailed the ruling. ""With all the confusion about what Islam stands for in Spain, we were afraid that it would be accused of protecting such conduct."" The ruling coincides with a recent heightening of sensibility toward domestic violence throughout Spanish society, where spousal abuse has become a high-profile issue in recentyears. ""Just five years ago, if a man beat his wife to death they called it a 'crime of passion,' and women were afraid to ask for help,"" said Maria Gloria Escudero, president of the Association for Aid to Battered Women. Mr. Mustafa's lawyer said he would appeal the decision, saying the case had been distorted by ""media pressure"" regarding domestic violence.",2004,"Spain"
"463","Belgian Faces Trial at Last In Sex Killings","West","After a delay that has been agonizing for the victims and their families, the trial of a suspected pedophile and murderer, Marc Dutroux, finally opened Monday in Arlon, a sleepy town near the border with Luxembourg. The trial begins seven and a half years after two terrified girls were rescued from a dungeon under a terrace house in Charleroi, a run-down industrial town in the south. The girls were Sabine Dardenne, then 12, who had been chained in an underground cell and raped repeatedly for almost three months, and Laetitia Delhez, 14, who had been imprisoned just six days before they were discovered by the police. The girls survived their ordeal, under a house owned by Mr. Dutroux. Four other girls died in gruesome circumstances, and Mr. Dutroux is charged with homicide, kidnapping and aggravated rape. Three other defendants are being tried with him, including Michelle Martin, one of his former wives. Ms. Dardenne, now 20, broke her silence recently and explained why she planned to appear as a witness at the trial. ''I want to look Dutroux in the eye, and make him understand that despite everything he made me suffer, I did not go insane,'' she is reported to have said. Ms. Delhez is more anxious. ''It is very difficult for her,'' said her lawyer, Jan Fermon. ''I'm not sure she is able to take the stand.'' Mr. Dutroux was released from prison in 1992 after serving half of a 13-year sentence for multiple rape. Three years later two 8-year-old girls, Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo, were kidnapped in Liege, in eastern Belgium. Two young women, An Marchal, 17, and Eefje Lambrecks, 19, disappeared two months later while on vacation at Ostend, on the coast. A year later the bodies of all four were found buried in the grounds of properties owned by the defendants. Julie and Melissa are believed to have starved to death after Mr. Dutroux left them chained in his makeshift dungeon when he went to prison in December 1995 for four months for stealing a car. He is expected to say at trial that Ms. Martin, his wife at the time, was in charge of feeding the girls. She has said she was afraid to visit them in their cell. The police discovered the body of Bernard Weinstein, an acquaintance of Mr. Dutroux's, near their bodies. Mr. Dutroux confessed to drugging Mr. Weinstein and burying him alive, but later retracted the confession. Little is known about the deaths of the two young women. News reports have raised questions about the competence of the authorities. The police, for example, knew Mr. Dutroux was a convicted rapist. They were told by an informer that he had built a dungeon under his house in Charleroi. Yet when the police visited the property during the autumn of 1995 and heard young girls' voices, they did not ask to see the cellar. The girls were rescued only because a witness saw Ms. Delhez being abducted and reported what he could remember of the license plate of the van that took her away. The accusations of incompetence eventually led to the resignation of the justice and interior ministers and the chief of police in 1998, when Mr. Dutroux staged an embarrassing but brief escape from custody. The long delay in the trial has fed conspiracy theories, among them that Mr. Dutroux was collecting young girls for wealthy clients. He fed this rumor on Monday in comments to the television station VTM. ''Just because I did some stupid things doesn't mean I should have to pay for a mafia system of which I wasn't the motor,'' he was quoted as saying.",2004,"Belgium"

The book advises men not to punish their wives on sensitive areas of the body or with force but rather on the ''hands and feet, using a light rod so that the blows don't leave scars or bruises.''

"465","Some Spanish Muslims Fault Coverage of Cleric's Trial","West","As Spain's Muslim community prepared for evening prayers last Friday, a 15-month jail sentence that a Spanish court gave a Muslim cleric earlier in the week for inciting violence against women was the hot topic of conversation. The media, many Muslims said, were giving the Spanish public a distorted view of the values of their religion. ""This case and [the cleric's] opinions go against Islam,"" said Ikram Oulad Zemouri, a 21-year-old Muslim woman, outside Madrid's main mosque. ""It's an image that comes from a couple of generations ago. Now we're very modern and completely Spanish."" Nearly 500,000 Muslims live in Spain, most of them immigrants from North Africa. Tensions with the majority Roman Catholic population are common, and many Muslims say that the Spanish establishment is constantly looking for ways to discredit them. Consequently, many Muslims in Spain were  apprehensive in July 2000 when women's rights groups filed a complaint against Mohamed Kamal Mustafa, the imam in the city of Fuengirola, on Spain's southern Mediterranean coast. His book, ""Women in Islam,"" incited violence against women, complainants said, by advising  men on how to beat women without leaving marks. Prosecutors took up the case, and Mustafa's trial was closely covered by the Spanish media. The cleric claimed he had merely interpreted the teachings of Muslim texts. But other Muslims who testified denied that holy writings encouraged wife beating. In its verdict, the court rejected the argument that the texts represented Islamic religion or culture. It concluded that the treatment of women advocated in the book was a personal opinion of Mustafa that broke Spanish and European Union human rights laws. The writings of Mustafa, ""are foreign to the religion and doctrine of Islam, which condemns any type of mistreatment or discrimination against women,"" the Spanish Federation of Islamic Religious Entities said in a statement. ""Fortunately, that slander against Islam and its prophet has not been tolerated"" by the court, said Jadicha Candela, president of the Muslim women's association An-Nisa and a witness during the trial. ""The mistreatment of any living being goes against the very roots of Islam."" But even as Muslims applauded the decision, some expressed concern about how news organizations had covered the case. ""For me, more important than this individual case is the image it has presented to the public in the media and the media's complete willingness to perpetuate negative images,"" said Mohamed Elafifi, a spokesman for Madrid's Muslim community. ""I don't think it is a conflict of cultures,"" Elafifi said, ""as much as people's readiness to believe stereotypes."" Community leaders say that most Muslims are happy in Spain, having found jobs and schooling for their children. Girls are allowed to wear head scarves to school, and many do; in neighboring France, the government is planning a ban on head scarves in public schools, calling them unacceptable religious symbols in a secular institution. At the Marrakesh Bar, a small magnet for Madrid's working-class Moroccan community, the buzz on Friday was entirely focused on why the trial was such big news. ""I was wondering why they're giving this guy so much attention in the news,"" said a 36-year-old who declined to give his name. ""The reason is because he's Arab. Spaniards have no problem with Islam or Muslims. It's the Moors that bother them. It's pure racism."" A dozen men at the bar concurred that younger Spaniards are more open and tolerant than their parents but that the media continue to use racism to make news. ""This guy [Mustafa] should rot in jail. Nobody doubts that. But it should also be a crime to make a big deal out of something just because he's a Moor,"" the 36-year-old said. But a Muslim woman leaving the Madrid mosque disagreed, pointing to reports of 70 deaths attributed to domestic violence in Spain in 2003. ""Domestic violence is an important subject. It's in the papers all the time,"" said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Just because it happens in the Muslim community doesn't mean it shouldn't make the papers."" Mustafa's lawyer said he would appeal the case, calling the sentence ""unfair and a result of the media pressure.""",2004,"Spain"

The site morphed to feature up-to-the-minute official news from her camp to help concerned fans stay informed.

In a statement released yesterday, Minogue said, ""My heartfelt thanks to the incredible number of people who have sent messages of love and support over the last two days."" She is undergoing tests in preparation for surgery later this week. So far, tests show the cancer is contained. The company that helped fund ""Super Size Me"" is suing director Morgan Spurlock, saying he's hogging its portion of proceeds from the 2004 hit documentary, in which Spurlock eats only McDonald's food for a month. According to attorney Bill Kelly, his client, Cast Iron Partners, gave office space to the filmmaker in exchange for stock in Spurlock's company. But, Kelly claims, his client is still hungry for its share of the profits. ""We bet on this long shot and they're basically trying to keep all the money,"" he says. Spurlock's attorney, John Sloss, calls the claim ""baseless and without merit."" Although the film reportedly grossed $30 million globally, Spurlock maintains he has received only a small portion of that pie. ""I haven't even made a million dollars,"" he asserts.

"467","Police 'Quite Sure' Austrian Woman Is Schoolgirl Missing for 8 Years","West","Natascha Kampusch vanished on her way to school on March 2, 1998, when she was 10. On Thursday, the police said they were ''quite sure'' that she was the young woman who turned up this week saying she had been held captive, confined much of the time in a small cellar. The police said the man who was believed to have held the woman killed himself on Wednesday, a few hours after she had sought help at a home on the quiet, small-town street where she says she was held. While expressing confidence in the woman's identity, investigators said they were still waiting for DNA verification. The missing girl's parents met with the woman and said they also were sure that she was the daughter who disappeared on her way to school in nearby Vienna more than eight years ago. The police said she had a surgery scar like Natascha, and they reported finding the missing girl's passport in the house. The police said the suspect in the kidnapping was Wolfgang Priklopil, a 44-year-old communications technician, and that he killed himself by throwing himself in front of a commuter train in Vienna. They cordoned off the street where Mr. Priklopil lived here, less than 10 miles northeast of Vienna, and released photos of the place in his house where the woman said she had been held. One photograph showed a small, cluttered room and narrow concrete stairs leading down to it from a tiny entrance that would have had to have been crawled through. Another photo showed a metal hatch that sealed the windowless, underground room. A federal police spokesman, Armin Halm, said there was a bed and a toilet in the cramped space. Images on television showed a small television in the room, which also had a sink and was littered with piles of books. Sabine Freudenberger, one of the first police officers to have contact with the woman on Wednesday, told an Austrian television station that the man apparently threatened her and said that was probably the reason she did not try to flee sooner. The police said the woman had been examined by a doctor and did not have signs of injuries, but added that her condition was still being studied. Officer Freudenberger said she believed the woman had been sexually abused but did not yet realize it, saying that the woman said ''she did everything voluntarily.'' Ms. Kampusch's mother, Brigitta Sirny, said on Austrian television that she was very proud of her daughter. ''She said 'mama mausi' to me,'' Ms. Sirny said, recalling the emotional moment she met with the woman and embraced her. Mausi -- literally ''little mouse'' -- is a pet name some Austrians use in addressing their loved ones. Ms. Kampusch's father, Ludwig Koch, his eyes glistening and voice wavering, told Austrian televisions that he had thought he would never see his daughter again. The state broadcaster ORF carried remarks from Erich Zwettler of the Austrian federal police saying that the woman escaped from her captor when the door to her hiding place was left open and she ran into a nearby yard, where she told an elderly woman she had been kidnapped and identified herself as Natascha Kampusch. Nikolaus Koch, a lead investigator, said on Austrian television that the police had contact with the suspected kidnapper about three months after Natascha disappeared in 1998. He had a ''sturdy alibi'' at the time, Mr. Koch said.",2006,"Austria"
"468","Discredited Somali Quits Dutch Politics; Advocate for Women Is Critic of Islam","West","Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali woman who moved to the Netherlands, won a seat in the Dutch parliament and became one of Europe's best-known champions of immigrant and Muslim women's rights, said Tuesday she would give up her seat and leave the country because she is being stripped of citizenship for lying on an asylum application 14 years ago. Hirsi Ali, a harsh critic of Islam and Dutch intolerance toward immigrants, has been negotiating for a position at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and expects to begin there in September, according to her spokeswoman, Ingrid Pouw. In a statement Tuesday, Hirsi Ali said she was proud that she had ""put the oppression of immigrant women  --  especially Muslim women  --  squarely on the Dutch political agenda."" She said she had spoken out against what she called ""issues related to Islam,"" including limits on speech, the murder of women deemed to have brought shame on a family, and the religion's failure to condemn genital mutilation. She came to international prominence in 2004 for writing the screenplay for ""Submission,"" a short film that outraged many Muslims and prompted an Islamic radical to kill its director, Theo van Gogh. The film featured four women, wearing see-through robes with words from the Koran scribbled on their bodies, who claimed to have been abused by their Muslim husbands. Hirsi Ali's outspokenness and celebrity made her a high-profile target of complaint in the Netherlands, both from Muslims and anti-immigrant figures. The target of frequent death threats, she has lived in semi-hiding under armed protection for about four years, conditions that she said contributed to her decision, months in the making, to leave the Netherlands. Pouw said that Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk, a member of Hirsi Ali's VVD political party who has taken a hard line on immigration issues, informed Hirsi Ali in a letter delivered Monday night that her passport was being revoked and she was being stripped of her citizenship for lying on her 1992 asylum application. Speaking at a news conference, Hirsi Ali said that she recently lost a court case brought by neighbors who claimed her presence was a security problem and a nuisance, and she was going to have to vacate her government-provided apartment by the end of August. ""It is difficult to live with so many threats on your life and such a level of police protection. It is difficult to work as a parliamentarian if you have nowhere to live,"" Hirsi Ali said in the statement. ""It has become impossible since last night, when Minister Verdonk informed me that she would strip me of my Dutch citizenship."" Hirsi Ali, whose legal name is Hirsi Magan, arrived in the Netherlands in 1992, claiming that she was fleeing an arranged marriage. She was awarded Dutch citizenship in 1997 and was elected to parliament in 2003. On her asylum application, she gave a false name and date of birth and lied about the countries she had lived in and visited before arriving in the Netherlands, claiming she recently had fled war-torn Somalia when she actually had lived in Kenya for 12 years. Although it has been known for at least four years that she put false information on her asylum application, the issue came under renewed focus last week when a Dutch TV documentary looked at her case. The report included statements from family members that her marriage was consensual, not arranged. That element of her life story goes to the core of her international persona, and, if untrue, could seriously damage her reputation and credibility. ""I have said many times that I am not proud that I lied when I sought asylum in the Netherlands,"" Hirsi Ali said in her statement Tuesday. ""I did it because I felt I had no choice. I was frightened that if I simply said I was fleeing a forced marriage, I would be sent back to my family. And I was frightened that if I gave my real name, my clan would hunt me down and find me."" ""The allegations that I willingly married my distant cousin, and was present at the wedding ceremony, are simply untrue,"" she said of the television documentary. ""I refused to attend the formal ceremony, and I was married regardless."" Hirsi Ali said that last fall she informed senior members of her party that she would not seek reelection in 2007, and that recent events and renewed political attacks against her had accelerated long-standing plans to get out of Dutch politics and move abroad. An official familiar with her case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that a recent Dutch court ruling that lying on an asylum petition was grounds for expulsion had raised concern that Hirsi Ali's case would be used as a cause celebre for anti-immigration activists, and that it would be ""hugely embarrassing"" because ""the same issue was being used to throw out Moroccans and Kurds."" The renewed controversy over Hirsi Ali's asylum erupted while she was in the United States promoting her new book, ""The Caged Virgin: An Emancipation Proclamation for Women and Islam."" Andrew Pappas, spokesman for the American Enterprise Institute, confirmed that she has been offered an appointment as a resident fellow.

"469","In Britain, Rape Cases Seldom Result in a Conviction","West","After Linda Davies reported to police that her 15-year-old daughter had been raped, it took three months -- plus two dozen phone calls and a threat of legal action -- before police questioned the suspect, a 28-year-old neighbor. ""I gave police his name, address, mobile phone number, car registration -- everything but his passport,"" said Davies, 44, a strong-minded mother of two daughters. ""I was basically begging them. He lived five minutes away from us."" The suspect was finally arrested but acquitted at a trial in which the judge told the jury that he was ""in a way a man of good character"" because his previous criminal convictions, for possession of stolen goods and marijuana, did not involve violence. Davies was furious at the judge, who also instructed the jurors to ignore the victim's young age, and at police, who lost cellphone records that contradicted the defendant's account. ""This has shattered us,"" Davies said. ""We felt like the whole system was against us."" Davies said she was stunned to learn that her daughter's case was the rule, not the exception. According to government statistics, only 5.7 percent of rapes officially recorded by police in England and Wales end in a conviction. ""What are they saying?"" Davies asked. ""That 95 percent of women that come forward are telling lies?"" In Britain, a nation whose justice system has been used as a model around the globe, government officials and women's rights activists agree that rape goes largely unpunished. Solicitor General Vera Baird, who oversees criminal prosecutions in England, estimated that 10 to 20 percent of rapes are brought to authorities' attention. According to government figures, 14,000 cases a year are reported and 19 out of 20 defendants walk free. ""There will never be proper female equality and appropriate dignity afforded to one-half of the population if it's possible to rape somebody and get away with it,"" said Baird, one of the highest-ranking women in the British government. Thousands of victims each year once chose not to go to police because of shame, women's advocates say. Now, the advocates say, the bigger reason is that rape victims feel the system is stacked against them. A 2005 report commissioned by the police found a ""culture of skepticism"" in the justice system when it came to rape cases, and recommended shifting the focus from seeking reasons not to believe the accuser to gathering evidence to support the charge. Lisa Longstaff, spokeswoman for the London-based group Women Against Rape, said rape cases are ""not a priority"" for busy police and prosecutors and, as a result, ""so few rapists get locked up that those who do feel unlucky rather than guilty."" Even some cases that do end in a guilty verdict stir outrage. Last year, a judge sentenced a 24-year-old man to two years in prison for having sex with a 10-year-old after concluding that the girl had ""dressed provocatively."" Patricia Scotland, England's first female attorney general since the job was created in the 15th century, appealed that sentence. It was increased to four years. Longstaff and others said that despite advances toward equality, sex crimes run up against a persistent societal bias -- pronounced in the male-dominated police and judicial system -- that women have only themselves to blame. Julie Bindel, a feminist activist and writer, said there has been a huge cultural shift since the 1950s and 1960s toward acceptance that unmarried women can have casual sex. But, she said, ""women are allowed that bit more freedom as long as men behave. When men choose not to, it comes right back at women: 'What did you do to stop him? What was it about you that he chose you to rape?' "" A Claim of Mixed Signals  In a TV ad paid for by the police of Manchester, England, that began airing this month, a young man and woman are enjoying a pleasant evening, at first. But after they drink alcohol, dance and kiss, the man leads the woman out of the nightclub, yanks her pants down and forces her to have sex against a wall as she cries, ""No. No. . . . Get off of me."" In the ad, the man is locked up. In real life, according to dozens of interviews with victims and experts, this is exactly the kind of case that ends in an acquittal, if it goes to court at all. Acquittals are often won on the ""mucky sex"" defense -- that the man got mixed signals from the woman and what resulted really wasn't rape. Danielle West, 30, who reported to police that she was raped after a boozy office Christmas party in December 2006, said police seemed uninterested in her case once she said she had been drinking heavily. West, an American who manages a team of Web analysts in London, turned visibly upset as she recounted her story in a quiet corner of a coffee shop. She said police, rather than giving her the benefit of the doubt, seemed ""hostile"" and intent on trying to ""trip me up."" ""I was constantly fighting to get someone to believe me,"" said West, who has a young daughter. She said a female officer flatly told her that she believed no crime had been committed and that West had simply gotten ""drunk and had a shag,"" a British term for sex. ""I couldn't believe it,"" West said. ""If you had told me this was modern-day Kabul, okay. But London?"" She has since hired a lawyer to file a formal complaint against the police. A police spokesman said it was ""inappropriate"" to comment on West's case because an investigation into her complaint was ongoing. Debaleena Dasgupta, a lawyer who represents West, said another client filed a complaint against an officer who allowed a man accused of rape to go on vacation before police took his statement. In yet another case, a 38-year-old woman from Cornwall said police interviewed, weeks apart, two men whom she accused of raping her one night, giving them time to coordinate their stories. Improving Investigations  ""We have got to do better,"" said John Yates, assistant commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police. He described the rape conviction rate as ""appalling"" and said police had ""to build better cases."" Rape cases are particularly challenging, he said, because women often delay reporting, there are no eyewitnesses and alcohol blurs the victim's recollection of details. ""Every crime requires good first steps,"" he said, such as interviewing witnesses immediately and grabbing footage off the millions of closed-circuit security cameras in Britain. ""If you get the first steps wrong, it's hard to re-create it."" About 25 percent of reports of assault and 75 percent of homicides lead to someone being found guilty. In the 1970s, the rape conviction rate ran at more than 30 percent. The difference now is that there are far more ""date rape"" cases -- like the one depicted in the Manchester police ad. Kerim Fuad, a barrister who has defended more than 100 men accused of rape, including the defendant in the Davies case, said most of the time the defendant and the accuser know each other and the jury must decide whom to believe. A woman always has a right to say no, he said, but when she goes into a man's bedroom late at night after they have both been drinking, juries may have a hard time voting to send a man to prison. Fuad declined to speak about specific cases, but he said he has been surprised by some ""not guilty"" verdicts. He said jurors have been shown compelling evidence -- such as blood at the scene or internal  injury to the woman -- and still not returned a guilty verdict. It is illegal in Britain to interview jurors -- even after a verdict. But public opinion polls show that a sizable proportion -- a quarter to a third -- of Britons say a rape victim is responsible for the attack if she is drunk or wearing ""sexy"" clothes. ""As many as one in two young men believe there are some circumstances when it's okay to force a woman to have sex,"" said Conservative Party leader David Cameron, citing studies. ""In my mind,"" he said, ""this is an example of moral collapse."" 'Let Down by the System'  Around the world, rapists are rarely punished. In the United States, 13 percent of rape reports end in a conviction. In many developing and Muslim countries, women's activists say many victims don't even report gang or stranger rapes because it is so difficult to win convictions. Reporting has even led to victims being charged with adultery or sentenced to public lashings for ""mingling"" with men. In wealthier Western countries, women are told that this crime shouldn't be hidden and are counseled to take a stand against men who force them into unwanted sex. ""But what is the point,"" asked Davies, when in the end the prosecutor often has a poorly put-together case, the defense contends that the sex was consensual -- at least mostly -- and the jury is told to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt? ""When we do report it, we are completely let down by the system,"" she said. Governments collect crime statistics differently and international comparisons are difficult, but England's conviction rate stands out as particularly low. That has led to calls to reform a tradition-bound judicial system where judges and attorneys in criminal courtrooms still wear white wigs. Police, prosecutors and judges are increasingly being trained specifically to deal with sex crimes. Judges are being urged to allow wider use of expert testimony so that, for example, a rape trauma expert could explain why a victim might delay reporting. Now, the defense often uses that delay to attack a victim's credibility. Until a few months ago, prosecutors were barred from interviewing victims and met them only on the day of the trial. Ken McDonald, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service, called this restriction ""mad."" He said it dated back centuries to the days when witnesses stuck straw in their shoes outside courtrooms to indicate their testimony could be bought. 'I Was Happy Before'  Linda Davies's daughter, who asked that her first name not be used, said her courtroom experience two years ago still keeps her awake at night, crying. The 5-foot-2, brown-haired student met the prosecutor minutes before the trial. She had no warning that the defense would insinuate that she had a tarnished reputation and agreed to the sex for pocket cash -- and that the prosecutor wouldn't object. She was floored when Judge Jonathan Van Der Werff, as recorded in a transcript, told the jury that the defendant was ""in a way a man of good character"" and that it should disregard her age, ""in case it's worrying you."" Now retired, Van Der Werff declined an interview request. The defendant, who is unemployed, never took the stand. The teenager said he had told her he was 19; police later told her he was 28. The girl said in an interview that the man invited her to his apartment. ""He told me he wanted to get his dog to take on a walk,"" she said, covering her face. She had initially thought he was nice and kissed him. But then, she said, ""he told me he would do something really bad to me"" if she refused sex. ""I couldn't push him off and I was trying really hard,"" said the girl, who weighs 90 pounds. She said she wished police had interviewed someone at the local supermarket where she stood sobbing after the attack, or had asked to see the store's video surveillance tapes. ""This has made me a different person,"" she said, her voice fading and her brown eyes looking into the distance. ""I was happy before. Now I am angry. ""I feel I didn't get justice. If I ever have kids and this happened to them, I wouldn't tell them to report it."" Researchers Jill Colvin and Karla Adam in London and staff researcher Robert E. Thomason in Washington contributed to this report.",2008,"United Kingdom"

"471","In Sweden, Sex Assault Gets Little Tolerance","West","When Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, asked two Swedish women out on dates in August, he may not have known that Swedish laws protecting women in their sexual encounters include wide-ranging definitions of sexual assault and rape. Now Mr. Assange, an Australian who is currently in Britain, faces an extradition request from Swedish prosecutors who want to question him on whether separate sexual encounters he had with each of the women became nonconsensual after he was no longer using a condom. Mr. Assange has denied all wrongdoing. ''If he claims that truth and transparency is behind WikiLeaks, he needs to accept the same standards of transparency for himself and come testify,'' said Claes Borgstrom, a lawyer representing the two women. Swedish criminal laws regarding sex offenses are not necessarily all that much stricter than the laws in many other European countries, Mr. Borgstrom said. But Swedish women, backed by a strong consciousness of women's rights and a history of a very public discussion of the scourge of sexual violence, may be more willing than most to look to the law for help. The number of reported rapes in Sweden is by far the highest in the European Union, according to the European Sourcebook of Crime and Criminal Justice Statistics, which cites 53 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants. Britain has the next highest rate, at 24 per 100,000. Stefan Lisinski, a veteran crime reporter for the daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter, said he spent between a third to half of his time writing about sexual crimes. Last month a senior police chief was convicted of rape in a high-profile appeals case. This is most probably not a result of more sexual violence taking place in Sweden, legal experts said, but a result of more crimes being reported. Some people say, in fact, that if female empowerment -- economic, social, and also legal -- has a different quality in Sweden than in other countries, it is because men are also at the heart of the gender-equality debate. Eighty-five percent of Swedish men take parental leave and even conservative male politicians call themselves feminists. With men and women more equal at work and at home, and concerns about the state intruding actively into family and personal affairs long gone, some taboos that may have protected sexual offenders may also be disappearing. Some people are now lobbying for an additional tightening of the sexual assault and rape laws in Sweden. They contend that the definition of rape should be expanded to include situations in which a woman does not explicitly say no to sex, but clearly signals her opposition in other ways. ''Sometimes we lawyers joke that soon you have to have a written permission before you can have sex,'' said Bengt Hesselberg, a defense lawyer with extensive experience in sexual cases. If Sweden's current criminal code is not much stricter on sexual offenses than those of other European countries, the Swedish laws may be more nuanced, by differentiating among three categories of rape and, unusually, invoking the concept of ''unlawful coercion.'' There is a category identified as ''severe rape,'' which involves a high degree of violence and which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for the perpetrator; another known as ''regular rape,'' which may involve some violence and calls for a maximum sentence of six years; and a third called ''less severe rape,'' which may not involve violence but still includes the imposition of sexual intercourse on a person against her will. The prosecutors seeking Mr. Assange's extradition suspect that he may have engaged in this last category, which is punishable by as much as four years in prison.",2010,"Sweden"
"472","U.S. Islamic Web Site Is Taken Down","West","LONDON -- A United States-based extremist Islamic Web site was taken down on Friday after the British authorities complained of a post praising a young woman who stabbed and nearly killed a British lawmaker over his support for the Iraq war. The post included a list of 383 British lawmakers who voted for the war, with instructions on tracking their movements, and it called for Muslims to ''raise the knife of Jihad'' against them, according to The Times of London, which reported the post on Friday. It also included a link for buying a kitchen knife, the report said. The site, RevolutionMuslim.com, is no longer available, but Google shows a cached version that predates the post. It is registered in Bellevue, Wash., a suburb of Seattle, and was run this year from Brooklyn. E-mails and calls to the site went unreturned Friday. But a large disclaimer at the top of the cached version cites the First Amendment right to free speech and states that it is ''not affiliated with any terrorist states or organizations.'' It says it ''condemns all forms of terrorism carried out in the name of freedom and democracy.'' Why the site was taken down was unclear. Legal experts say that it is difficult for the government to force a site off the Internet. But the government could pressure a site operator or service provider to take it down. The British Home Office said it had raised the issue of the post with the American authorities, and the Metropolitan Police counterterrorism section said it had also made inquiries. The site drew attention this year when, after an episode of the cartoon ''South Park'' centered on the Prophet Muhammad, it posted the addresses for the show's creators next to a picture of the body of the Dutch film director Theo van Gogh. Mr. van Gogh was fatally stabbed and shot in 2004 after making a documentary film about the abuse of women in some Islamic cultures. A spokesman for the site claimed at the time that the message was not a threat, merely ''a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them.'' The stabbing case that was the focus of the recent post ended Wednesday with the 21-year-old attacker, Roshonara Choudhry, being given a life sentence. She stabbed the member of Parliament, Stephen Timms, twice in the stomach at a public meeting in May in what she called ''revenge'' for the people of Iraq. She cited RevolutionMuslim.com as one of her inspirations. She found more in the YouTube videos of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Muslim preacher who affiliated himself with the Yemen-based group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. YouTube had received complaints from American and British lawmakers about the videos in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the day Ms. Choudhry was convicted, YouTube removed hundreds of them. On Thursday, Revolution Muslim published its praise of Ms. Choudhry as a ''heroine,'' and expressed the hope ''for her action to inspire Muslims to raise the knife of jihad against those who voted for the countless rapes, murders, pillages and torture of Muslim civilians as a direct consequence of their vote.''",2010,"United Kingdom"

"475","France: Court Fines 2 Women for Wearing Full Veil","West","PARIS - For the first time since the passage of a law banning the wearing of full veils in public, a French court on Thursday fined two women for wearing the niqab, an Islamic facial covering that leaves only the eyes uncovered. The court in Meaux, a city northeast of Paris, ordered Hind Ahmas, 32, to pay 120 euros, while Najate Nait Ali, 36, was fined 80 euros, a court official said. Yann Gre, one of their lawyers, told Agence France Presse that the two women would appeal their case to France's highest court and to the European Court of Human Rights. Activists at an association contesting the ban, Don't Touch My Constitution, said the European Court of Human Rights would most likely sanction the French state by eliminating or amending the ban. The group paid the women's fines. Ms. Ahmas and Ms. Nait Ali were both arrested outside the town hall of Meaux in May, on the birthday of Jean-Francois Cope, the city'a mayor and a major backer of the ban. Mr. Cope is also the head of President Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right U.M.P. party. The fines were the latest examples of the country's struggle to assimilate its Muslim population of more than five million. They came less than a week after a ban on street prayers aimed at Muslim worshipers spilling into the streets of Paris and other cities entered into force across France. There have been no reported fines or arrests so far related to the street prayer ban. A series of videos shot in 2009 in Paris by someone who opposed the street prayers shows large crowds on sidewalks and in streets as mosque space is used up. The video below -- in French -- describes one proposal from the French government: pray in unused state-owned buildings. One of the proposed sites in Paris is an empty army barrack. As for the niqab, French police have stopped 201 women, and 159 have received citations for wearing the veil since the law entered into force in April, though none had been issued fines before Thursday, according to the Interior Ministry. Before the ban, the ministry estimated that about 2,000 women wore facial veils in France. Also on Thursday, Kenza Drider, a Frenchwoman who wears the veil and is an outspoken critic of the law, announced that she would run for president in next year's presidential elections. Her chances to win are widely viewed as poor. Last October, France became the second country in Europe, after Belgium, to ban the wearing of facial veils in public as a way to defend French values and women's rights and to fight what many here see as separatist tendencies among Muslims.

"476","Indignation, Anger and Confusion in France Over Strauss-Kahn Case","West","Days after the revelation that the case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn was on the verge of collapse, France reacted with a mix of Gallic indignation at the American justice system, fevered speculation about his political rehabilitation and visceral anger by some  feminists that the former head of the International Monetary Fund was now being cast as a victim. The almost overnight transformation of D.S.K. -- as Dominique Strauss-Kahn is widely known in France -- from alleged sexual predator to seeming victim of an unscrupulous accuser has riveted and divided the country. The news that the Sofitel maid who had accused D.S.K. of rape had repeatedly lied to prosecutors has also spurred talk of a political comeback for the one-time French presidential contender that only weeks ago was deemed impossible. Citing a Harris Interactive poll in the French daily Le Parisien, Le Monde noted Sunday that  49 percent of the French people surveyed favored D.S.K.'s return to politics while 45 percent opposed it. Le Monde reported that despite the renewed support for D.S.K., only 43 percent wanted the Socialists to delay primaries to allow Mr. Strauss-Kahn -- who cannot travel outside the United States because of the charges against him -- to re-enter the race. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. ""Let's all stay calm,"" Gérard Le Gall, a public opinion expert and a Socialist, said hours before a court in Manhattan changed the terms of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's bail, freeing him on his own recognizance. ""The version of the story has changed before and could change again. It's too early to draw any conclusions."" Jean-Francois Cope, the secretary-general of the ruling center-right UMP party of French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Sunday that the return of D.S.K. to French politics was a matter for the Left, the newspaper Liberation reported. But Mr. Sarkozy's sports minister, Chantal Jouanno, was less diplomatic, insisting that Mr. Strauss-Kahn had undermined France's image globally. ""He has not given a very positive image of France in recent days, between his appetites for luxury and other things,"" she said dryly. Leading the charge of those seeking to rehabilitate D.S.K. is Bernard-Henri Levy, the French intellectual and darling of the Left in France, who was eviscerated by feminists in the aftermath of the arrest for defending a man accused of being a sexual predator. Mr. Levy has now cast D.S.K. in the role of a modern-day Dreyfus, insisting that he had been unfairly maligned by a frothing-at-the-mouth American media that he characterized as obscene to the point of being ""pornographic."" Writing in The Daily Beast, Mr. Levy said that there were five lessons to be drawn from the incident, which he said would soon be known as the ""Strauss-Kahn non-affair.""  Calling for the restoration of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's honor, along with his freedom, Mr. Levy said that justice in the case had been cannibalized by a grotesque sideshow during which the former banking chief had been globally humiliated, subjected to a perverse ""perp walk"" and denigrated by the media for a crime that had yet to be proved. ""The 'shame on you's' that greeted Dominique Strauss-Kahn as he arrived for the hearing on June 6th, shouted by battalions of hotel chambermaids who knew nothing of the actual case and whose protest had been orchestrated and scripted, were obscene,"" he wrote.  ""This vision of Dominique Strauss-Kahn humiliated in chains, dragged lower than the gutter - this degradation of a man whose silent dignity couldn't be touched, was not just cruel, it was pornographic."" Warming to his theme, Mr. Levy contended that D.S.K. had been dehumanized and transformed into a global hate figure in the same manner that Maximilien Robespierre had demonized those whom he deemed enemies during the French Revolution.* ""America the pragmatic, that rebels against ideologies, this country of habeas corpus that de Tocqueville claimed possessed the most democratic system of justice in the world, has pushed this French Robespierrism, unfortunately, to the extremes of its craziness,"" he said. ""In this case, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was no longer Dominique Strauss-Kahn. He was the symbol of arrogant France. He was the emblem of the world of the privileged, odiously sure of their own impunity."" He noted that the D.S.K. affair had laid bare the grievous temptation the world over to sanctify the words of victims. He insisted that one of the biggest victims in the case was the very principle, in the United States, of the presumption of innocence. ""He was crushed, then, by that fraction of the American judicial apparatus that, by putting Dominique Strauss-Kahn in stocks, by humiliating him before the entire world, by ruthlessly pursuing him, has probably ruined his life,"" Mr. Levy wrote. Invoking George W. Bush's notion of pre-emptive war, he said that Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney who had pursued the case against D.S.K., had pioneered a new concept, scarcely less horrifying, of ""pre-emptive penalty."" Indeed, Mr. Vance's conduct was subjected to scrutiny in the French media over the weekend, which reported that the Manhattan district attorney now faced the same media backlash that only days before had been directed against Mr. Strauss-Kahn. An article in Le Figaro that now that the case had turned in Mr. Strauss-Kahn's favor, Mr. Vance faced the ire of a voracious media.   ""The D.S.K. affair should have been the case of his life. Instead, it could prove a fatal blow to his career,"" the paper said. While some French critics attacked the American media and judicial system over the affair, others continued to expound the theory that Accor, the French hotel group that owns the Sofitel Hotel, was somehow . Francois Loncle, a Socialist member of Parliament, criticized the Accor Group, implying that its owners, had played a role in the arrest. ""Not all is clear about the role of Sofitel's management and the group Accor,"" Mr. Loncle said, adding that there may be unspecified ""links"" between Accor and certain underground French political forces. The French media have reported a close connection between Accor's owners and Mr. Sarkozy's center right UMP Party. Also underlying the debate in France has been whether the new revelations about Mr. Strauss-Kahn's accuser have undermined the cause of feminism in France. Many Frenchwomen have been outraged by the speed with which Mr. Strauss-Kahn has been once again embraced as a possible candidate for President, while the felony charges against him remain. At a meeting of French feminists over the weekend near Paris, many of those gathered said that the contention that the maid was a liar changed nothing.  ""If journalists think that this moment of political theater changes our way of seeing things, they are wrong,"" Caroline de Haas, one of the assembled, told Le Monde. ""Why did the DSK affair have to happen for the political class and the media to discover that there are 75,000 women in France raped each year? That professional inequality is the rule? That equality is an illusion?"" An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to the role of Maximilien Robespierre during the post-revolutionary ""terror"" in 18th-century France.

"479","Founder of Breast Implant Company Under Formal Investigation","West","PARIS -- The case against the founder of a French company at the center of an international scandal over substandard breast implants advanced on Friday as he was placed under formal criminal investigation. The suspect, Jean-Claude Mas, was detained in an early-morning raid on a house in southern France on Thursday in connection with the case of a woman who died last year of a rare form of cancer after her implants ruptured. Tens of thousands of women around the world who have the same defective implants are struggling with fear and confusion over whether to have them removed, with government health authorities giving differing advice. Mr. Mas was released from police custody on Friday after posting $131,000 bail. The original criminal complaint, filed with Marseille prosecutors by the sister of the deceased woman, had alleged manslaughter. But Mr. Mas's lawyer told iTele television that the judge investigating the case, Annaick Le Goff, was examining possible charges of involuntary injury. Mr. Mas's lawyer, Yves Haddad, told Europe 1 radio that he and Mr. Mas were ''confident'' that the implants were not dangerous, though he acknowledged that women were suffering. ''Everyone should be patient, serene,'' he said. The company Mr. Mas founded, Poly Implants Protheses, was closed by the authorities in March 2010, after revelations that it had used silicone that was industrial grade, not surgical grade, to save money on the hundreds of thousands of implants it sold around the world. The implants have a much higher rate of rupture than the industry norm, and the silicone inside can fall apart or leak into other areas of the body. The French authorities say there is no evidence that the implants cause cancer, but have urged women to have them removed. German and Czech officials have concurred. The Brazilian authorities recently ordered the country's public health system and health insurance companies to pay for the replacement of all the ruptured breast implants made in France. ''We're now in the hands of justice,'' said Mr. Haddad, the lawyer, on Friday. ''We're perfectly happy with that, because we can explain ourselves, as we did all day.'' Mr. Mas, who is also the subject of additional investigations related to the implants, has not been charged yet. As conditions of his release, Mr. Mas cannot leave the country and cannot contact other former executives of the company. He is required to meet regularly with the authorities. Mr. Mas's former deputy, Claude Couty, was also detained on Thursday and his lawyer, Christophe Mameli, said he had been freed shortly after Mr. Mas. But it was unclear whether Mr. Couty was put under investigation or not. ''I find it insufficient,'' Alexandra Blachere, who leads an association of women with the defective breast implant, told Le Monde on Friday. ''With all the victims and the prejudice, it's far too little,'' she said. ''French justice is a little too forgiving.''",2012,"France"
"480","Uncomfortable Truths","West","Far-right British parties such as the English Defense League and the British National Party  held protests throughout the trial against ""Islamists."" But putting aside the right wing's efforts to exploit the case to stir Islamophobia, the trial has in fact raised uncomfortable questions about the British-Pakistani community's attitudes toward women. Statistical snapshots suggest that British-Pakistanis are frequently linked to crimes like grooming, which includes any action taken to befriend a child before engaging him or her in sexual activity. Out of 77 recent convictions for grooming, rape and other predatory sex crimes, 67 involved Pakistani men. The majority of suspects who commit sex crimes in large groups - as opposed to acting alone - tend to be of Pakistani origin. One study about such groups found that 83 percent of 52 suspects charged in five major grooming investigations were Pakistani. Chief Crown Prosecutor Nazir Afzal - himself a Pakistani - has said that men of South Asian origin  are disproportionately responsible for on-street grooming, which involves cruising the streets and enticing girls with cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. The British-Pakistani community has tried to deflect criticism by arguing that focusing on the ethnic identity of the perpetrators is counterproductive; better to do more about the young girls left vulnerable to attack. Afzal, for example, has repeatedly cautioned against focusing on the racial element, emphasizing instead the problem of young female victims who are ""unwanted, unloved."" The Rochdale Council of Mosques, an umbrella organization representing 14 mosques and madrassas, issued this statement recently: ""This is not a race, faith or creed issue. It is about crime and exploitation of young vulnerable girls, and vulnerability goes across the color divides."" Women's rights groups back this line of reasoning. Speaking to the Guardian, Marai Larasi, co-chair of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said ""an excessive focus on some cases of sexual exploitation with a primary focus on ethnicity rather than the exploitation itself is misleading and fuels racist attitudes which ultimately won't help women and girls."" Yet I find myself agreeing with the Children's Minister Tim Loughton, who says there's little to be gained from ""shying away"" from race. If anything, there is something to be lost: the British police have been criticized for performing poorly to prevent sex crimes by Pakistani gangs for fear of being accused of institutionalized racism. (They dropped a rape case that could have led to the earlier detection of a gang.) Britain's Pakistani community may be moved to review its attitude toward women and sexuality if the disproportionate number of British-Pakistanis involved in grooming is openly acknowledged. The historian Starkey goes too far when he suggests that members of the Rochdale gang were upholding ""cultural norms"" by exploiting young women. But the fact remains that education about women's rights is lacking in Pakistan and its diaspora. Pakistan is the world's third-most dangerous country for women. More than 1,000 women and girls are victims of honor killings each year, and up to 90 percent face domestic violence. Pakistan's independent media, which are usually vehement when it comes to defending the nation's honor or pushing back against racial slurs from foreigners, have been strangely silent about the Rochdale trial. Might this be because they fear there is some truth to the claims that Pakistani attitudes toward women are regressive?",2012,"United Kingdom"
"481","France Is Expected to Pass A New Harassment Law","West","PARIS -- French lawmakers next week are expected to approve a farther-reaching sexual harassment law after a top court threw out previous legislation on the grounds that it was vague and insufficient. Under the new bill, which unanimously passed the National Assembly on Wednesday, sexual harassment will be considered a criminal offense, punishable by two years in jail and a fine of 30,000 euros, almost $37,000. The Senate passed a similar version of the bill earlier. The new law, which is expected to be adopted on Tuesday, will replace legislation that had been on the books for 10 years before it was thrown out in May by the Constitutional Court. Its ruling came after a deputy mayor who had been convicted of harassing three employees complained that the law was too vague. Several cases of sexual harassment have been frozen or dismissed since May, leaving what Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, France's minister for women's rights, called ''a dangerous void.'' Under the old law, which was modified in 2002, the notion of sexual harassment was restricted to ''obtaining favors of a sexual nature,'' and was punishable by a year in jail and a fine of about $18,500. The new law defines harassment as ''imposing on someone, in a repeated way, words or actions that have a sexual connotation'' and either ''affecting the person's dignity because of their degrading or humiliating nature'' or putting him or her in an ''intimidating, hostile or offensive situation.'' The law will also include behavior aimed at obtaining a sexual act inside and outside the workplace. According to a preliminary report issued by the National Assembly on July 18, such behavior can include blackmail, sexual jokes, neck massages, leaving a pornographic magazine on a person's desk or looking at someone up and down. Offenders can also face up to three years in jail and a $53,000 fine for more serious offenses, like sexually harassing a minor under 15 years old or a person who is physically disabled or ill. The bill, which resulted in a rare consensus between left and right, was hailed by many groups, particularly feminists, as a significant step toward women's rights in a country where sexism and gender inequalities often provide a fertile ground for sexual harassment. According to government figures, 1,000 legal cases of sexual harassment are registered every year, but far fewer lead to sentences. For example, from 2005 to 2010, about 80 sexual harassment cases a year resulted in sentences, the figures show. Some female politicians have also lashed out against sexism in Parliament. On July 17, just days before the vote on the new sexual harassment bill, male lawmakers in the National Assembly hooted and made catcalls as Housing Minister Cecile Duflot, wearing a floral dress, spoke about an architecture project. ''We were just admiring her,'' Patrick Balkany, a conservative legislator, told Le Figaro. Others saw it differently. ''We feel in remarks or behaviors that there is sometimes less consideration for a female parliamentarian than for her male counterpart,'' wrote Olivier Dussopt, a Socialist lawmaker, in the magazine Le Nouvel Observateur. Many legislators who voted in favor of the law said it had no direct link to the case of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the International Monetary Fund's disgraced former chief, who has been accused of several sexual assaults. Still, some acknowledge that the Strauss-Kahn case set off soul-searching about France's laissez-faire attitude toward the impunity of the powerful. The widely publicized case ''allowed greater visibility and discussion of behaviors French society rightly judged unacceptable,'' Ms. Vallaud-Belkacem said in an interview with The Guardian published in June. The Strauss-Kahn case ''has created an electric shock in French society and made people more aware of sexual violence within the workplace,'' said Marilyn Baldeck, who leads a feminist group called the European Association Against Violence Toward Women at Work. ''We became conscious recently that sexual violence wasn't just limited to streets or couples,'' said Miss Baldeck, adding that the law would help restore the Socialist Party's image, which was sullied in the Strauss-Kahn case. Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a prominent Socialist, had been widely considered the front-runner for the party's presidential nomination before he was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper in New York last year. Still, for Miss Baldeck, the bill was rushed through too quickly, and its concept of ''sexual connotation'' remains too vague. ''When a boss invites 10 times a reluctant employee to dinner, is there a sexual connotation to that?'' asked Miss Baldeck, adding that she believed that there was.

Fourteen men were accused of participating in repeated rapes of two teenage girls in the housing projects of Fontenay-sous-Bois, outside Paris, from 1999 to 2001. The victims, now 29, reported being surrounded and raped by as many as two dozen aggressors at once. Ten of the 14 defendants, all minors at the time the crimes were said to have occurred, were acquitted Wednesday. More worrisome to critics, however, were the relatively light sentences for the four men who were convicted of gang rapes: two were given a year in prison; the third, six months; and the fourth, a suspended sentence. Under French law, minors convicted of gang rape can receive terms as long as 10 years in prison. Similar gang rapes have been reported in the country's poor suburbs in recent years. The crimes are viewed as the violent expression of a misogyny that is often described as deep and pervasive in those communities. Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the junior minister for women's rights and the government spokeswoman, spoke Thursday of the ''anger inspired by the atrocity of these crimes.''Speaking on France Inter radio, the social affairs and health minister, Marisol Touraine, said, ''Obviously, this affair is not going to encourage victims to declare themselves.'' A lawyer for the two women who brought the rape complaint, Laure Heinich-Luijer, said that given the lack of physical evidence in the case and the confusion and hesitation in the women's testimony, the acquittals in the case were ''understandable.'' But for the men who were convicted, Ms. Heinich-Luijer said, ''these are sentences that make no sense.'' Feminist groups in France reacted angrily. ''This verdict sends a catastrophic message to the whole of our society,'' said the organization Osez le Féminisme in a statement. ''To rape victims: bringing a complaint is useless. To rapists: you're allowed to rape!'' The group said that only a small minority of the 75,000 women it estimates are raped each year in France complain to the authorities. Another advocacy group, Ni Putes Ni Soumises (Neither Whores Nor Submissives), said it was ''scandalized'' by the verdict. ''The girls who dare to finally speak, and who step out of their silence, find themselves newly condemned by a justice system that has not heard them,'' the group said. Ms. Heinich-Luijer said it was not clear whether prosecutors would appeal the verdicts. Lawyers for the defendants did not respond to repeated requests for comment. One of the women, identified as Nina, brought her complaint in 2005, saying she had been raped by dozens of local teenage boys almost daily for six months beginning in September 1999, according to Ms. Heinich-Luijer. Nina, who was then 15, said she was forced to perform sex acts in apartments, in basements, in a public park and on the roofs of housing towers. The four convictions in the case were solely for acts committed against Nina, not for any described by the other woman, identified as Aurélie. In an interview on Europe 1 radio on Thursday, Aurélie said she regretted having gone to court. ''What good is it to bring a complaint if you end up with results like this?'' she asked. ''I just wanted to be recognized as a victim.'' One of the convicted defendants, identified in the French news media as Mahamadou Doucouré, is awaiting trial in the killing of his wife and is said to have confessed to her 2010 stabbing death. Mr. Doucouré's penchant for violence was ultimately behind Nina's decision to tell the authorities about the rapes, years after they had ceased: In October 2005, he assaulted Nina in the street, breaking her nose and leaving her unconscious. She went to the police about that attack, Ms. Heinich-Luijer said, and the officer taking her statement asked whether she wished to report anything else. She said that she did.",2012,"France"

"484","Ireland: Prime Minister Apologizes for Laundry Abuses","West","DUBLIN -- Prime Minister Enda Kenny offered an unreserved state apology on Tuesday over Ireland's failure to protect thousands of young women and girls consigned to virtual slavery in the so-called ''Magdalene laundries'' between 1922 and 1996. In a long-awaited, emotional parliamentary address, Mr. Kenny said women ''who are and always were wholly blameless'' not only deserved a formal apology for what they had suffered but also counseling and financial support. On behalf of the Ireland government and citizens, he apologized ''unreservedly to all those women for the hurt that was done to them, and for any stigma they suffered, as a result of the time they spent in a Magdalene laundry.'' Following his address, politicians from all sides gave a standing ovation to the survivors of the laundries and their supporters who embraced one another in the packed public gallery. Advocates of compensation for the roughly 1,000 survivors welcomed the apology. In an interview with RTE, the national broadcaster, Sally Mulready, chairwoman of the London-based Irish Women Survivors Network said: ''It was so significant and so genuinely expressed. He got the humanity of the suffering and what they endured but he also looked to the future and said 'whatever is left of their lives, let's make it comfortable for them; let's help them to recover.''' The formula for how to compensate the survivors has yet to be determined. The ''Maggies,'' as they were known, were excluded from a previous compensation for those who suffered in state-run institutions because officials contended that the laundries were never under the jurisdiction of the state. For many years, advocacy organizations in Ireland, Britain and the United States had accused successive governments of operating a ''deny until they die'' policy against the dwindling number of women affected, many of whom are now elderly. In 2011, the decade-long campaign won a significant breakthrough when the United Nations Committee Against Torture requested the Irish government to conduct an independent investigation after it accused Ireland of having failed to protect the rights of women in the laundries. This resulted in an official report published earlier this month, which found endemic state involvement in the laundries, contradicting successive assertions from those in power that they played no act or part in their operations. The report dealt with 10,012 women and girls detained in laundries from 1922 to 1996: the average age was 23, the youngest entered aged just nine and the oldest was 89. The report stated that 2,124 of them had been sent by the authorities. It is believed at least 4,000 more passed through the doors of two other large laundries not considered by the report. Mr. Kenny said the apology and redress also covered these women, a gesture welcomed by advocacy groups and politicians. The report compiled by the then-senator Martin McAleese, husband of the former Irish president Mary McAleese, found the state had ''significant'' involvement with a system comprising ten private institutions run by four orders of Catholic nuns, in which women and young girls were forced to work long hours for no pay. Not only did it consign thousands of young girls and women to these places, it failed to inspect their work practices in any meaningful way and awarded the institutions lucrative contracts to wash linen from prisons and other public facilities. In Irish lore the laundries were synonymous with so-called 'fallen women' -- unmarried mothers -- but the report found little basis to support this view, saying those concerned ''have for too long felt the social stigma of this wholly inaccurate characterization''. Many of the women were consigned to the laundries for petty criminal convictions. Some were the victims of abusive family relationships, and many had mental health problems. ''None of us can begin to imagine the confusion and fear experienced by these young girls, in many cases little more than children,'' Mr. McAleese wrote in his introduction to the report. ''Not knowing why they were there, feeling abandoned, wondering whether they had done something wrong and not knowing when, if ever, they would get out to and see their families again.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",2013,"Ireland"
"485","New Delhi Only Seems Far Away","West","LONDON -- Only an estimated 15 percent of female victims of rape and sexual assault in England and Wales report the crime to the police. Many of the rest say they chose not to because it was ''embarrassing'' or they considered the attack ''too trivial or not worth reporting,'' or because they ''didn't think the police could do much to help,'' according to new official statistics released last week. The publication by the Justice Ministry and the Home Office for the first time of ''An Overview of Sexual Offending'' also revealed that one in five of all women had been the victim of a sexual offense since the age of 16 and that there were about 400,000 adult female victims of sex crimes every year, including 69,000 victims of rape or attempted rape. The release of these startling figures was followed a day later by the police report on the full scale of the sexual crimes committed by the late BBC host Jimmy Savile, which noted 34 rapes among 450 individual complaints and disclosed that the vast majority of victims who overcame their embarrassment to report assaults during Mr. Savile's lifetime were not believed. The information has triggered a wave of sober introspection about attitudes toward rape here -- forcing a judderingly abrupt shift of geographical focus. For the past month, newspapers and news channels in Britain have devoted considerable attention to the unfolding details of the gang rape and murder of a physiotherapy student in New Delhi, with commentators lining up to discuss how India is a country battling deep-seated misogyny and to condemn official reluctance to tackle seriously the issue of violence against women. Blithely criticizing failings in attitudes toward women thousands of miles away is easy. Focusing on why it is that so few women come forward to report crimes in this country has proved harder. The director of public prosecutions, Keir Starmer, last Friday apologized to Mr. Savile's victims and called for victims of any sexual abuse who felt that their complaints had not been dealt with seriously to contact the police again and have their cases reviewed by new panels that are to be set up across the country. This would be a ''watershed moment'' in the way that victims of sexual assault would be dealt with, he promised, stressing that it was important that victims be believed. Campaign groups are also hoping that this will be a turning point. ''We must change the cultures and attitudes which allow abusive behavior to go unchecked,'' a statement from the End Violence Against Women Coalition declared. ''There is a real opportunity now to make the U.K. a global leader in how it deals with sexual and other violence against women and girls.'' The low conviction rates for rape are probably part of the reason that so many women here believe that the police cannot ''do much to help.'' Campaigners have previously estimated that only 6 percent of allegations of rape reported to the police resulted in a conviction for rape, but this widely cited figure has always been controversial, contested by the police and increasingly seen as part of the problem because it makes victims so cynical about the system that they decide not to press charges. The latest statistics from the report last week suggest that conviction rates are improving, if you look at cases that get to court; of those cases prosecuted in court, 62.5 percent ended in a conviction. Police guidelines for the sensitive handling of rape cases have been in use for some time. Staff members investigating sexual violence are trained how to talk to victims who have been raped. Those interviewers know that while they can ask any of the when, where, what and how questions, they must never ask ''Why?'' and particularly ''Why did you do that?'' because this questions a woman's own decisions and suggests shifting some of the blame from attacker to victim. A visit to one of Britain's well-respected sexual assault referral centers (where victims are sensitively fast-tracked through police questioning and medical examination so no evidence is lost) shows that where they are well staffed and funded, they provide an excellent service. But while considerable work has been done to improve police attitudes toward rape cases, the general public (which makes up the juries that listen to rape cases in court) remains very judgmental. Burglary victims are not expected to prove that they have been burgled, because people tend to believe them; rape victims still find themselves having to prove that something has happened to them and needing to justify their actions. And it is remarkable how frequently unhelpful attitudes are revealed by people who should know better. The senior Conservative politician Kenneth Clarke got into trouble last year when he was justice secretary for giving an interview in which he talked about ''serious rape,'' inadvertently suggesting that he thought there were categories of less serious rape. Then there was the senior BBC editor who, when explaining why he had chosen not to air a program about Mr. Savile's crimes last year, breezily said there was not enough substance to the material, using the now notorious line that there were ''just the women'' -- only the testimonies of the victims themselves. With attitudes like these, it is hardly surprising that so many of the 85 percent of victims who were asked why they did not report the attack indicated that the process was too embarrassing and ultimately futile to undertake.

"486","Irish Premier's Apology Fails to Appease Workhouse Survivors","West","DUBLIN -- Advocates for survivors of a Roman Catholic workhouse system that kept generations of young women and girls in virtual slavery expressed disappointment and anger on Tuesday at Prime Minister Enda Kenny's failure to formally apologize after a report found extensive state involvement in the institutions. Reacting to the 1,000-page government report, which found the state responsible for committing thousands of young women to the workhouses, the last of which closed in 1996, Mr. Kenny told Parliament that the women had been sent at a time when Ireland was a harsh, uncompromising and authoritarian place. ''I'm sorry that this release of pressure and understanding for so many of those women was not done before this, because they were branded as fallen women,'' he said. However, Mr. Kenny stopped short of issuing an official apology on behalf of the state for its involvement in the so-called Magdalene Laundries, saying that a full parliamentary debate would take place in two weeks after politicians had time to review the document. James M. Smith, an associate professor at Boston College and a member of the campaign group Justice for Magdalenes, described Mr. Kenny's statement as ''egregious and insensitive,'' adding that the government had received the report two weeks ago and had plenty of time to consider it. ''Mr. Kenny has failed the test of moral courage,'' he said. ''Yet again an Irish government has let down the very people it purports to serve.'' Professor Smith said the prime minister's failure to apologize not only was a setback for the dwindling number of survivors but would also ultimately reflect badly on the Irish state. ''The women really did expect something more from this government,'' he said. ''This fairly cynical response has lost it an awful lot of good will today as a result.'' Steven O'Riordan, a member of another lobby group, Magdalenes Survivors Together, said that while the report recognized that the Irish state was directly complicit in allowing the laundries to exist, Mr. Kenny's statement was ''halfhearted at best.'' ''I am annoyed because it sounded like a throwaway gesture,'' he said. The report found that 10,012 women and girls were detained in the laundries from 1922 to 1996, but this figure excludes two large laundries operated by one Catholic order. It stated that 2,124 of those detained in the institutions had been sent by the authorities. The survivors of the laundries are seeking a state apology for their treatment as well as redress for years of unpaid labor and pension payments. The ''Maggies,'' as they were known, were excluded from a previous compensation scheme for those who suffered in state-run institutions because officials said that the laundries were never under the aegis of the state. The institutions were named after Mary Magdalene, a biblical figure who, at the time of their founding in the mid-1800s, was generally thought to have been a prostitute redeemed by the teachings of Christ. While many women sent to work in the 10 laundries around the country were unwed mothers, the report found that the vast majority were referred for a wide range of other reasons, ranging from petty offenses to mental illness. In his introduction to the report, Martin McAleese, the committee chairman, said the women had for too long felt the social stigma of the ''wholly inaccurate characterization'' of them as ''fallen women,'' something ''not borne out by the facts.'' The report characterized the conditions in the laundries as ''harsh'' but found no evidence of systematic sexual abuse. Mr. McAleese said that did not mean the women had not suffered in other ways. ''None of us can begin to imagine the confusion and fear experienced by these young girls, in many cases little more than children,'' he said. ''Not knowing why they were there, feeling abandoned, wondering whether they had done something wrong and not knowing when, if ever, they would get out and see their families again.'' When women were admitted to the laundries, they were uniformly given different names, which survivors say was done to erase their identities. The report says that the religious orders that operated the laundries and cooperated with the committee explained that the new names helped to protect the women's privacy.",2013,"Ireland"
"487","Seeking Redress For a Mother's Life In a Workhouse","West","DUBLIN -- Samantha Long and her twin sister, Etta Thornton-Verma, were born in 1972 and adopted at 9 months. They never knew their birth mother and decided to try to track her down in the mid-1990s. ''Nothing prepared us for what we found,'' Ms. Thornton-Verma, who lives in New York, recalled in a telephone interview last week. ''We were prepared for the ordinary possibilities, like a teenage girl who got pregnant and wasn't in a circumstance to keep us,'' she said. ''But we were not thinking that she might be incarcerated by nuns.'' In 1995 they found their mother, Margaret Bullen, here in the Sean MacDermott Street Laundry -- one of Ireland's notorious Magdalene Laundries, or workhouses for girls -- where she had toiled since 1967, six days a week, without pay. They were shocked by her appearance. ''She was very disheveled and looked more than 20 years older than she was,'' Ms. Long said. ''She was 42, but we were looking at a pensioner's face. It was hard work, poor nutrition and forced labor.'' Ms. Long was among those present in the Irish Parliament on Tuesday as the government made public a 1,000-page report that concluded that there was ''significant state involvement'' in the incarceration of thousands of women and girls in a system of slave labor that continued until 1996. And she and her sister were among those disappointed when the Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, failed to issue an official and unambiguous apology for the state's role. The twins found that their mother had spent her childhood in state care and was transferred to a laundry in her midteens. She became pregnant twice while under the care of the religious order that ran the laundry. Conversations with their mother led her daughters to believe that they were conceived of sexual abuse. Both her twin babies and another girl born four years later were taken from Ms. Bullen and adopted. She never received any pay for decades of labor, nor did the religious order running the laundry pay contributions toward a pension. She stopped working in 1996, when the last of the laundries closed, and lived in a convent attached to the laundry for the rest of her life. She died in 2003 of Goodpasture syndrome, a disease associated with exposure to toxic chemicals used in the laundry. She is buried in a communal grave for Magdalene women in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. Most of the Magdalene women are now either dead or very old; it is estimated that just 1,000 of the 10,012 young women the report said had passed through the laundries are alive. In the weeks leading up to the publication of the report, some came forward to recount their experiences, which remained raw decades later. There is widespread public support for their demands for an official apology from the church and the state, and for compensation for their years of unpaid work. In the cases of the Magdalene women who have died, it is their children, taken from them shortly after birth, who are speaking out on their behalf. Ms. Long and Ms. Thornton-Verma have been campaigning for an apology for their biological mother for 10 years. Mr. Kenny's statement made it clear that they would have to wait at least two more weeks for Parliament to debate the report, and even then they may be disappointed. ''When I heard that the report confirmed state involvement I was pleased, but I was really hoping for an apology,'' Ms. Long said. ''I just hope that in two weeks' time the state is going to rally around the women and say, 'You do belong to us, and we are sorry for leaving you alone and treating you that way.' That is very important.'' The Magdalene Laundries were a network of 10 institutions run by four religious orders -- the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of Charity, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd and the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge. They were used in certain cases to detain women considered deviant in what was a deeply conservative Roman Catholic country. Women who had children outside marriage, girls deemed flirtatious (so-called preventive cases), those with mental disabilities and even victims of sexual abuse were sent to the laundries, often turned in by family, where they simply disappeared from society. While Mr. Kenny's statement did not satisfy the Magdalene survivors and their descendants, the report did represent some progress. It demonstrated that the Irish government can no longer rely on the defense that it ''did not refer individuals, nor was it complicit in referring individuals to the laundries.'' That argument was used in part to resist repeated requests for a statutory inquiry until an advocacy group, Justice for Magdalenes, brought the issue to the attention of the United Nations Committee Against Torture in 2011. At that time, a government delegation told the committee that ''the vast majority of women who went to these institutions went there voluntarily or, if they were minors, with the consent of their parents or guardians.'' The report issued Tuesday shows that statement to be untrue. The report found that a quarter of the women who passed through the institutions were sent by the state. The laundries operated as a parallel prison system to which the Irish courts routinely sent women who were handed down suspended sentences for petty crimes. Women were referred from government-run mother and baby homes, and girls from industrial schools were sometimes transferred to Magdalene Laundries when they reached puberty. State employees, like the police, regularly returned those who escaped. Several government departments, and even the official home of the Irish president, showed up in the laundries' meticulously kept ledgers as customers who sent linen to be cleaned. Martin McAleese, the chairman of the committee that produced the report, said he hoped the findings would bring ''healing and peace of mind to all concerned, most especially the women whose experience of the Magdalene Laundries had a profound and enduring negative effect on their lives.'' He was largely praised as producing a nuanced report that filled in patchy knowledge about the laundries. Records available on the length of stay for the women -- just 45 percent of the cases -- showed that the median stay was seven months and that 8 percent stayed for longer than 10 years. The average age of those in the laundries was 23. It also emerged that the laundries were not profitable, contrary to what was commonly thought (though survivor groups are challenging that point). The report also found no evidence of sexual abuse. Mari Steed, the director of Justice for Magdalenes, which has lobbied for an official apology and compensation for the women, called the government's response to the report ''very disappointing.'' Her mother spent 10 years in a laundry. ''It is going to be difficult to go back to the women and say that they have to wait again,'' she said.",2013,"Ireland"

"489","A Call for Aid, Not Laws, to Help Women in Italy","West","ROME -- Responding to the persistent problem of violence against women, Prime Minister Enrico Letta this month announced ''very harsh, very tough'' measures to counter domestic abuse and what he called ''femicide,'' the killing of women because they are women, often at the hands of current or former husbands or boyfriends. The 12-point decree, effective immediately, sets stricter penalties for the perpetrators of domestic abuse, sexual violence and stalking, and it expands protections for some of the most vulnerable women, including immigrants who lack residency permits. ''We think that in our country it is necessary to send a strong signal'' to combat domestic violence, Mr. Letta said when he announced the measures on Aug. 8. After a spate of widely reported attacks on women, the decree is ''a sign of radical change on the issue,'' he said. But new attacks in the wake of Mr. Letta's announcement have bolstered criticism from victims' advocates who say that stiffer penalties alone are not enough to protect women and stem domestic violence. Last week, a woman in northern Italy was fatally stabbed by her former partner, who then hid her body in his car; a Sicilian woman was murdered in front of her child by her former husband, who then committed suicide; and a man whose motives are still unknown threw acid in a woman's face in Genoa. More than 80 women have been killed so far this year, most of them by husbands, boyfriends or former partners, according to an unofficial tally kept by the Italian news media. Many of the victims had called the police to report stalking or harassment. About 75 percent of the 2,200 women murdered from 2000 to 2012 -- roughly one murder every two days -- were killed by partners or former partners, according to a study carried out by Eures, a European Union agency that monitors social affairs and employment issues, in collaboration with the Ansa news agency. A United Nations report last year on violence against women in Italy called domestic abuse the ''most pervasive form of violence'' in the country, affecting nearly 32 percent of women between the ages of 16 and 70, according to a 2006 survey. It also noted that more than 90 percent of the Italian women who were raped or abused did not report it to the police. Victims' advocates and counselors who work with battered women say they welcome the attention the government is focusing on a long-neglected social problem, but they contend that for the most part the decree misses the mark. Italy does not need tougher laws, the critics say, because existing legislation is adequate, if arbitrarily applied. What is missing, they contend, is a better-organized, better-financed network of psychological, legal and financial assistance for women who decide to leave an abusive relationship. ''To make changes to the penal system without addressing the issue of how to better protect women means being blind to reality,'' said Barbara Spinelli, a feminist and a lawyer who wrote a report on domestic violence in Italy for the United Nations' Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. Reports by United Nations and European agencies underscore ''the failure of Italian institutions and authorities to give adequate protection to women victims from their partners or ex-partners,'' Ms. Spinelli said. ''Either you carry out the necessary structural reforms, or this decree won't help women.'' One such structural problem is the paucity of emergency housing for abuse victims. Rome's principal emergency shelter for battered women consists of a nondescript three-room apartment near the once-legendary Cinecittà film studios. Serving Rome as well as the entire Lazio region of central Italy, it can accommodate no more than three women at a time, for a maximum stay of a week. Given the scale of the need, there are ''dramatically few places'' for battered women to go to in Italy, said Emanuela Donato, one of the workers at Servizio Antiviolenza S O S Donna H24, a 24-hour-a-day service for victims of domestic violence and emergency shelter. So far this year, she said, more than 220 women have called the center's help line. ''Multiply that across Italy, and you get a sense of the emergency,'' she said. ''And that's just the number of women who have the courage to recognize that they are victims and come to us for help.'' According to the recommendations of a Council of Europe task force, countries should have one shelter place for a woman and her children for every 10,000 residents. By this measure, Italy should have about 5,700 spots available in shelters nationwide, but it has just 500. Italy also falls short when it comes to legal, medical, psychological and financial assistance for women who leave an abusive relationship, domestic abuse workers said. ''The message that emerges is stay home, because if you leave there is nothing, or very little to help you,'' Ms. Donato said. In fact, in the current bleak economic situation, ''many shelters and anti-violence centers around Italy are closing because of lack of funding,'' said Oria Gargano, the president of Be Free, the association that manages the S O S shelter with Rome's municipal administration. The government decree ''doesn't really touch this question,'' she said. Indeed, Italy's prolonged recession is likely to ''aggravate the problem'' of domestic violence, said Patrizia Romito, a professor of social psychology at the University of Trieste, by making it more difficult for women to find the money they need to leave an abusive situation. Moreover, for potentially abusive men, the loss of a job can remove those ''social anchors that can restrain violent behavior,'' Ms. Romito said. Victims' advocates also say that cultural factors contribute to violence against women. So-called honor killings of women said to have disgraced their family were legal until 1981, said Luisa Pronzato, who runs a blog about women for the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera. Paternalism ''is part of our culture,'' and it continues to permeate Italian society, she added. Even police officers and health care workers called to respond to domestic violence are not immune tom such attitudes, others say. ''We had a recent case where a woman was threatened by her husband with a knife, and after calling the police, she was told by the officer, 'Why don't you cook a nice plate of pasta and make up?' '' said Nadia Somma, the president of Demetra, an association that runs a shelter in Ravenna, in northeastern Italy. The new decree, Ms. Somma said, overlooks the reality that victims and abusers often continue to live together even after charges are filed because of Italy's notoriously slow legal system, and victims' advocates say that even convicted abusers rarely stay in jail for long. The government has defended the decree, which still requires the approval of both houses of Parliament to become law, and Maria Cecilia Guerra, the deputy labor minister who led the task force that drafted the decree, said that beyond offering more protection for victims, the measures were intended ''to increase awareness about domestic violence.'' Ms. Guerra acknowledged that while the network providing assistance to battered women needed to be improved, Italy's economic crisis would require groups offering services to victims to develop better ''synergy among existing structures.'' But Ms. Donato, the shelter worker in Rome, said it was difficult to operate the center with the little money it received. The lack of resources is ''its own form of violence against women,'' she said.",2013,"Italy"
"490","Feminism a Good Fit for One 'Good Muslim Boy'","West","LONDON -- Nazir Afzal's enemies are a diverse lot. Some are Muslim men like him, men with British passports and roots in Pakistan who can't get their head around one of their own pointing the finger at forced marriages and honor crimes and ''giving racists another stick to beat us with.'' Others come from Britain's far-right fringe and can't get their head around a Muslim being a chief prosecutor for ''their'' queen and ''their'' country. They once wrote a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, demanding that he fire and deport Mr. Afzal. Mr. Afzal, 51, chuckles. ''I was born in Birmingham, England, and I'm not going back there.'' One of 13 chief crown prosecutors in Britain, he oversees 100,000 prosecutions a year and manages 800 lawyers and paralegals in the prosecution service's North West Area, the most populous after London. He was the first minority chief prosecutor ever appointed and remains the most senior Muslim lawyer in the country. Mr. Afzal has prosecuted ordinary thieves, white-collar criminals and hooligans. But this fast-talking man with spiky salt-and-pepper hair and a slightly restless manner is also Britain's national czar on violence against women. He has perhaps made his biggest mark in aggressively prosecuting crimes against women in minority communities. Before Mr. Afzal came along, few in multicultural Britain talked openly about the 10,000 girls married off against their will every year, let alone the dozen or so murdered each year in the name of family honor. He has helped set up a national hot line for women at risk of forced marriage -- something the U.S. government is currently talking to him about -- and is working with the Home Office to criminalize the practice (a law is expected next spring). Last year, he prosecuted nine South Asian men for raping and trafficking white girls in the former mill town of Rochdale in a high-profile case that was branded a ''wake-up call'' by many in the community. Human rights, he says, must always trump cultural rights: ''There are problems in minority communities that can't be taboo.'' Being a man, a practicing Muslim and the son of immigrants from the conservative tribal area in northwestern Pakistan might make him an unlikely feminist in the eyes of some. But that's just what Mr. Afzal calls himself -- and his gender, he says, is by far his biggest asset. ''I'm not the first person to take up this fight in Britain; I'm just the first man, and that makes it a lot easier,'' he said. Women's rights campaigners have gladly welcomed Mr. Afzal into their sisterhood. Efua Dorkenoo, advocacy director on female genital mutilation for Equality Now, said male allies were ''critical'' for the success of gender equality campaigns, especially where abuses are cloaked in cultural terms. ''When men like Afzal speak up about violence against women, it has much more resonance in Asian and African communities,'' Ms. Dorkenoo said. It was in 2004 that Mr. Afzal, a father of four, had his own wake-up call. A group of women came to see him. One told of a girl who had burned herself to death to avoid a forced marriage; she had been 17, the same age as his daughter is now. Another recounted how a woman had been on the run from her family for more than eight years after refusing to marry a man she didn't know. ''I didn't know this was happening in this country,'' Mr. Afzal said. That same year, he organized a conference in London to learn more. Shortly after, he sat down with the police to create a national database of so-called honor crimes. ''Before I knew it we had dozens and dozens of cases,'' he said. Two years later, he successfully prosecuted the cousin and brother of Samaira Nazir for her murder. She had wanted to marry someone her family objected to. They stabbed her 18 times in front of two infant nieces who were splattered with her blood. It was one of the first occasions that an honor killing entered public consciousness. In 2008, one of Mr. Afzal's own relatives in Peshawar was killed by her husband's family for demanding a divorce. But Mr. Afzal's crusade for women's rights is even more personal than that. Born a ''brown boy'' in middle England a year after his parents arrived in 1961, he, too, bears the scars of inequality. He was bullied and beaten at school often. His father, a caterer for the British, told him: ''Get used to it.'' And he did. ''I thought this was how it was, and I put up with it, and I think a lot of women feel the same about the abuse they suffer,'' he said. His work on gender equality often intersects with his efforts to be a bridge between white Britons and the South Asian community, particularly after suicide bombers attacked the London transport system on July 7, 2005, killing 52 and injuring nearly 800. Mr. Afzal remembers speaking at London City Hall a few weeks later. The mood in the country was tense, Islamophobia on the rise. Mr. Afzal, then deputy chief prosecutor in London, had been asked to help engage the Muslim community, but his comments on gender-based violence irked some. A man stood up in the audience and said: ''Nazir, why are you giving these racists another stick to beat us with?'' His response: ''The community should carry their own stick.'' He has long since stopped using Twitter because the abuse got to be too much. Following last year's Rochdale case, a police guard was placed outside his house. But Mr. Afzal is not one to lose his spirit. ''I've done my bit for multifaith engagement,'' he likes to point out. ''As a good Muslim boy, I've been married three times. First to an Irish Catholic, then to an Indian Hindu and then to a British Sikh.''",2013,"United Kingdom"
"491","A Muslim Prosecutor in Britain, Fighting Forced Marriages and Honor Crimes","West","LONDON -- NAZIR AFZAL'S enemies are a diverse lot. Some, like him, are Muslim men who were born in Britain but have roots in Pakistan or other South Asian countries and cannot understand how Mr. Afzal would be critical of forced marriages and honor crimes and give ''racists another stick to beat us with.''

They once wrote a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, demanding that he fire and deport Mr. Afzal, who chuckled before responding, ''I was born in Birmingham, England, and I'm not going back there.'' One of 13 chief crown prosecutors in Britain, he oversees more than 100,000 prosecutions a year and manages 800 lawyers and paralegals in England's Northwest, the largest region after London. The first Muslim chief prosecutor ever appointed, he remains the nation's most senior Muslim lawyer. Mr. Afzal, 51, has prosecuted white-collar criminals and hooligans. But this fast-talking man with spiky salt-and-pepper hair and a slightly restless manner is also Britain's go-to prosecutor on violence against women. And while most of his cases involve white perpetrators -- he prosecuted a stalker of Princess Diana in 1996 and this year brought the former BBC presenter Stuart Hall to justice for sexually abusing minors -- perhaps his biggest mark has been his aggressive pursuit of cases involving crimes against women in minority communities. Before Mr. Afzal, few in multicultural Britain talked openly about the 10,000 girls, most from South Asia and two-thirds of them Muslims, who are married off against their will every year in Britain, much less the dozen or so killed each year in the name of family honor. Mr. Afzal helped set up a national hot line for women at risk of forced marriage -- something the United States government is talking to him about duplicating -- and he is working with the Home Office to criminalize the practice. (A bill in Parliament that would do just that is expected to be passed next spring.) Last year, he successfully prosecuted eight British men of Pakistani origin and an Afghan man for raping and trafficking white girls in Rochdale, a former mill town near Manchester, in the Northwest, in a high-profile case that was branded a ''wake-up call'' by many South Asians. The ringleader was sentenced to 19 years in prison, the other eight from 12 to 16 years. Mr. Afzal does not mince words when he speaks about the ''hundreds of young British girls who have their clitoris cut off in genital mutilation every year.'' He is adamant that human rights must always trump cultural rights. ''There are problems in minority communities that can't be taboo,'' he said. ''No community should be allowed to give refuge to men who commit crimes against women.'' BEING a man, a practicing Muslim and the son of immigrants from the conservative tribal area in northwestern Pakistan might make Mr. Afzal an unlikely feminist in the eyes of some. But that is how he describes himself -- and his gender, he said, is by far his biggest asset. ''Women have been talking about these issues for a long time,'' he said. ''I'm not the first person to take up this fight in this country, I'm just the first man, and that makes it a lot easier.'' ''I come from these communities. I understand their patriarchal nature. I can challenge them,'' he continued. ''And because I am a man, the men in the community are more likely to listen to me.'' Women's rights campaigners have welcomed Mr. Afzal into their sisterhood. Efua Dorkenoo, advocacy director on female genital mutilation for Equality Now, said male allies were ''critical'' for the success of gender equality campaigns, especially when rights abuses are cloaked in cultural terms. ''When men like Afzal speak up about violence against women, it has much more resonance in Asian and African communities,'' she said. ''When we women speak up, we are often dismissed as westernized and no longer speaking for the community.'' It was in 2004 that Mr. Afzal, a father of one daughter and three sons, had his own wake-up call when a group of women came to see him. One told of a girl who had burned herself to death to avoid a forced marriage. She had been 17, the same age his daughter is now. Another recounted the story of a woman who had been on the run from her family for more than eight years after refusing to marry a man she did not know. His visitors pressed Mr. Afzal to use his office to bring honor crimes and forced marriages out of the shadows and into the courtroom. ''I didn't know this was happening in this country,'' he said. But the stories shook him, and that same year he organized a conference in London to learn more. Shortly after, he sat down with the police to pull together a national database on honor crimes. ''Before I knew it, we had dozens and dozens of cases,'' he said. TWO years later he successfully prosecuted the cousin and the brother of a young woman, Samaira Nazir, for her murder. Ms. Nazir had wanted to marry someone to whom her family objected, a desire for which she was stabbed 18 times in front of two infant nieces who were splattered with her blood.

"492","Sex After 50? Less Important for Women, Portuguese Court Rules","West","MADRID -- It was difficult and depressing enough for a middle-age widow in Portugal who was unable to have a normal sex life after botched surgery. But when one of Portugal's highest courts recently decided to reduce the compensation she had been awarded, on the grounds that sex was less important after 50, it was the kind of insult added to injury that ignited an outrage that was not hers alone. ''This is an example of how the highest levels of Portuguese justice, besides being disconnected from society, insist and persist in denying the most basic rights of women that they should protect,'' said Rosa Monteiro, vice president of the Portuguese Women's Studies Association. The widow in question, Maria, now 69, is a former house cleaner who has battled with the courts for nearly 20 years. She did not wish to reveal her full name because ''she feels huge shame and also feels diminished as a woman,'' said her lawyer, Vítor Manuel Parente Ribeiro. He said that his client had undergone surgery in 1995 at the state-run Alfredo Da Costa maternity clinic in Lisbon to remove glands that secrete fluid for lubrication. The work was done on the advice of a doctor there, who ''told her it would be an easy procedure, and she would go home on the same day.'' But after doctors mistakenly cut a nerve, Maria was left incontinent and unable to have sex without severe pain. She won a decade-long court battle, but the clinic appealed. On Oct. 9, the ruling finally came. Portugal's Supreme Administrative Court reduced her compensation to 111,000 euros, or about $139,000, from &#x20ac;172,000. Among its arguments, the court's panel of three judges, including one woman, said Maria was already a mother of two children and 50 years old at the time of the surgery, an age when sex ''does not have the importance that it had at younger ages.'' Some lawyers said the latest ruling was not only degrading for a woman whose life had been ruined by bad surgery but also violated Portugal's legal and constitutional guarantees that sexual orientation and age will not be a barrier to justice. João Gama, a professor of law at the Catholic University in Lisbon, said that the ruling reflected both ''a sexist and socioeconomic prejudice'' among the judiciary toward ''a housekeeper's sex life.'' In contrast, he argued, the Supreme Court recently awarded &#x20ac;100,000 to a 55-year-old man who suffered erection problems after his prostate was unnecessarily removed and who was described as financially well off in the ruling. ''My point is that courts value highly the sex lives of old people if they are male and wealthy,'' Mr. Gama said. Ms. Monteiro of the women's association said the ruling ''openly evokes the obligation of this woman to take care of children and husband, a set of gender roles expunged from our law'' in the era after the country's 1974 revolution that returned Portugal to democracy after a lengthy dictatorship. Mr. Parente Ribeiro, Maria's lawyer, said he planned to bring new legal action against the Portuguese state for delaying the case and to appeal the ruling before the European Court of Human Rights. ''I cannot explain such a decision,'' he said.",2014,"Portugal"
