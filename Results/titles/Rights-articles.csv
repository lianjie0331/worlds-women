"1","For Women in Ivory Coast, New Fight for Equality","Africa","Tomam Constance Yai is on a crusade against polygamy. Although she scarcely tolerates it, her problem is not so much the traditional rural practice, which is widespread throughout this region, where the economics of hardscrabble farming have long encouraged men to take more than one wife. Instead, the crusade of this leader of the Ivoirian Association for the Defense of Women's Rights is aimed at an equally well established urban phenomenon of multiple wives, mistresses and concubines that she says perpetuates the sexual privileges of men while stunting the lives of African women. In past battles Ms. Yai, a 40-year-old speech therapist whose unflinching gaze conveys the sense of a woman who relishes big challenges, has had mixed results. But in this instance, she saw an opportunity to use a proposed change in the law to draw attention to such problems. Her newest campaign began after the publication of a proposed bill that would change the rules governing divorce on grounds of adultery. The proposed law would grant a man the right to divorce his wife for adultery with little more provocation than finding her engaged in intimate conversation with another man. For women to obtain divorce for adultery, their husbands would have to be caught in a sexual act at the couple's home with the same woman more than once. Seizing upon the outrage the bill fanned in some quarters, Ms. Yai has used the bill to focus attention on the broader question of inequalities frozen in place by the legal system and by the weight of tradition. ""Having a husband who sleeps at home every night is considered by many women to be a rare privilege,"" Ms. Yai said. ""It should not be a privilege; it should be normal."" Some women's groups have quietly begun petitioning the Government to withdraw the bill. But Ms. Yai and other members of her movement adopted a high-profile campaign, urging women to take direct action like marching on the homes of Government ministers to get their wives to pronounce themselves on polygamy and adultery. ""Since independence, not a single man has been prosecuted for polygamy in this country,"" Ms. Yai said. ""If the Government is proposing this, it is because men are afraid. It would seem that they have begun to say to each other, if we don't limit the power of women now, they will soon be demanding full equality."" According to embarrassed Justice Ministry officials, the controversial passages in published versions of the bill reflected nothing more than secretarial errors. The sole intent, they say, was to be a first step toward eventual ""depenalization"" of adultery, which is theoretically punishable by imprisonment. But for Ms. Yai and her allies, the biggest challenge may be in mobilizing a largely indifferent public.  Women's groups have been virtually alone in denouncing the measure. What is worse, Ms. Yai says, many women seem resigned or indifferent. To jar women out of complacency, Ms. Yai has sought out women who she says have already been wronged by the justice system and by husbands who take advantage of it. One such woman is Martine Kuyo, 46, who says she discovered her husband one day locked in the embrace of another woman in a parked car. When Ms. Kuyo complained, her husband filed for divorce, claiming that his wife, to whom he was married for more than 25 years, had failed to entertain his family properly. Since discovering that her husband, who is a doctor, had authorized a colleague to sterilize her without her knowledge during a Caesarean section in her last pregnancy, Ms. Kuyo has spent three years bitterly resisting a divorce. ""When the judge in the case sees me, you would think I was a threat to him,"" Ms. Kuyo said. ""I walk in front of him and he frowns. My husband appears in the courtroom, and the judge smiles. ""Why? Because men realize that they are in this together."" As Ms. Yai tells women, ""The message we want to get across to women is that there is someone here to help when it is your turn for a hazing.""",1996,"COTE D'IVOIRE"
"2","Senegal Bans Cutting Of Genitals Of Girls","Africa","In a step toward eradicating the tradition of female genital mutilation in Africa, the Parliament of Senegal banned it this week, responding to a campaign by Senegalese women. The campaign had unusual origins, said Rana Badri, who coordinates action against the practice by Equality Now, a New York-based group helping women in the developing world as well as immigrants. Ms. Badri attributed the campaign to a private Senegalese women's organization called Tofhan, which means breakthrough. But she said the group had not set out to fight genital mutilation. Rather, the effort came about as a result of literacy classes and human-rights discussions among women at the grass-roots level. ""It started with basic reading and writing,"" she said. ""They didn't ask the community to stop the practice. This came as a result of the women's awareness of their rights."" The procedure, which many Africans call ""female circumcision,"" involves the removal of all or part of the external female genitals. The often crude and painful operations not only deprive victims of sexual feelings but may also injure them in ultimately life-threatening ways. Carol Bellamy, executive director of Unicef, welcomed the Senegalese Parliament's decision, which was reached on Thursday. ""Senegal's action is of great significance,"" she said, ""because it reflects the resolve of African women to end a cruel and unacceptable practice which violates the rights of all girls to free, safe and healthy lives."" Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, estimates that 130 million women, most of them in Africa, have undergone genital mutilation. Each year more than two million girls undergo the procedure, some of them in infancy, the agency says. Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan account for 75 percent of cases, according to Unicef. In some countries, as many as 95 percent of girls are affected. More than half a dozen African nations south of the Sahara have now instituted bans, which are enforced with fines and jail terms. The procedure is barred in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Djibouti, Ghana, Guinea and Togo. Other countries, among them Uganda, discourage it. In North Africa, the Egyptian Supreme Court upheld a ban on the practice last year and also ruled that it had no place in Islam. In Senegal, President Abdou Diouf lent his support to the campaign, making legislative action easier. Ms. Bellamy said this week that international support for local groups was also important. The work of African grass-roots organizations seems increasingly to demonstrate that most women would not accept female genital mutilation as a part of tradition if they had the power to change their fate. ""Women around the world who have the courage to take a stand on female genital mutilation need sustained international support,"" Ms. Bellamy said, ""in order to convince their societies to move away from this horrendous practice."" http://www.nytimes.com An article on Monday about a decision by the Parliament of Senegal to ban genital cutting of women misspelled the name of a Senegalese women's organization that has campaigned against the practice.

"3","AIDS in South Africa","Africa","To the Editor: Re ""Newest Statistics Show AIDS Still Spreading in South Africa"" (news article, March 21): Women in South Africa face disproportionately high risks of being infected. Yet the implication you draw, that this reflects women's failure to respond to public relations campaigns promoting the use of condoms and safe sex practices, flies in the face of the complex life histories of South African women with whom I met in 1999 and 2000. Confronted with male partners who threaten violence if women insist on condom use, many women make what seems like an unhealthy choice -- to give up the effort to change their partner's sexual behavior -- in exchange for the healthy choice to protect themselves against immediate violence and abuse. Is it really only women's behavior that has failed to remain healthy? KATHLEEN B.

"4","Nigeria's Women","Africa","To the Editor: Re ""President Urges Nigeria to Fight Tyranny of AIDS"" (front page, Aug. 28): It seems as if the plight of women was not one of President Clinton's priorities in his visit to Nigeria. Since last October, beginning with the state of Zamfara, Islamic Shariah law has been introduced in several Nigerian states, denying women access to public transportation, restricting their employment and treating them as second-class citizens in other ways. A coalition of women's organizations in Nigeria has been protesting and calling on the government to take action against these laws, which violate the Nigerian Constitution. Mr. Clinton's visit represents a missed opportunity to support these efforts to protect the fundamental human rights of women in Nigeria.

"5","For World's Women, Progress and Loss","Africa","To the Editor: Although I agree with your Johannesburg bureau chief about the specter of sexism and patriarchy so rampant in South Africa (Week in Review, Oct. 11), I take issue with her assessment of the situation of women there. She portrays South African women as hapless victims of sexism and patriarchy who show no inclination or ability to change the situation. The reality is that in less than a decade, South African women have made enormous gains. For example, they persuaded the African National Congress to allocate one-third of its parliamentary candidates to women. There are more female ministers and deputy ministers in the South African Government than there are in the United States or many other Western democracies. South African women have been instrumental, through their active participation in anti-apartheid activities, in contributing to the burgeoning, albeit fragile, democracy there. And they continue to lobby for women's rights. PENNY ANDREWS Flushing, Queens, Oct. 12, 1998 The writer is a professor at CUNY School of Law at Queens College.",1998,"South Africa"
"6","Women's Rights Laws and African Custom Clash","Africa","In theory, what happened to 14-year-old Sibongile in this hilly, crowded township outside Durban in November could not happen today -- at least, not legally. On a broiling Saturday morning, as more than a dozen women looked on, Sibongile joined 56 other Zulu girls outside a red-and-white striped tent. One by one, they lay on a straw mat beneath the tent; one by one, they received a cursory inspection of their genitals by a woman in a ceremonial beaded hat. As the inspector pronounced judgment on the state of each girl's hymen -- ''virgin,'' ''nice,'' ''perfect'' -- each departed to the excited trilling of the women who were observers. Until Sibongile lifted her red pleated skirt and submitted to her examination. Near silence followed her out of the tent. ''Only one of them cheered,'' she said, looking stricken at the determination that she was not a virgin. ''I feel very bad because I haven't done anything.'' To many Zulus, such virginity tests are a revered custom, one that discourages early sex and, after falling into disuse, has been revived to fight the spread of H.I.V. But to many advocates of women's and children's rights, the practice is unscientific, discriminatory and -- to girls who are publicly and perhaps falsely accused of having lost their virginity -- emotionally searing. This month, their arguments persuaded South Africa's Parliament to ban some virginity testing, with violations punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The ban is an example of how sub-Saharan Africa is slowly, but inexorably, enshrining into law basic protections that have long been denied women. But it also hints at the frailty of the movement toward women's rights in the region. Not only is the new law a watered-down version of what was proposed, but few here believe it will curb a tradition so deeply embedded in Zulu and to a lesser extent Xhosa culture. ''We will uphold our traditions and customs,'' said Patekile Holomisa, president of the Congress of Traditional Leaders, a political party in South Africa. ''There are laws that passed that do not necessarily have any impact on the lives of people. I imagine this will be one of those.'' The story is similar in much of this region: measured by laws and political status, women are making solid, even extraordinary, gains toward equality. Women's equity commissions are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa's 48 nations. Women are now deputy heads of state in at least seven nations and a woman is president of one, Liberia. They hold one in six parliamentary seats, matching the worldwide average. Women's rights legislation has also been enacted. Swaziland's new constitution, adopted this year, makes women the legal equals of men, able to own property, sign contracts and obtain loans without the sponsorship of a man. Zimbabwe this year allowed women to inherit property from their husbands and fathers. Liberia passed a stiff statute against rape, and president-elect Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman in modern Africa to be elected a head of state, pledged to enforce it. Last month, a comprehensive protocol on women's rights, ratified by 15 African nations, took effect as part of the African human rights charter. Even so, African governments are typically much quicker to adopt international protocols than to pass domestic laws. And they are quicker to pass domestic laws than to enforce them, or to tamper with the unwritten rules -- the so-called living law of custom -- that govern much of rural Africa. In Guinea, for example, female genital cutting has been a crime since 1965, punishable by life in prison or death. But in 40 years, says the Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group in New York, no case has ever been brought to trial. The United Nations Children's Fund says 99 percent of women in Guinea are cut, a rate unchanged for decades. In a region where nearly half of women are illiterate and courts and legal aid are often remote, it is often tribal leaders, not members of Parliament, who decide what is law. Almost invariably men, tribal leaders are rural Africa's cultural arbiters. In some African nations, their interpretations of traditional law overrule civil and criminal statutes, said Colleen Lowe-Morna, executive director of Gender Links, a women's rights group in Johannesburg. ''For the majority of women who live in rural areas, customary law basically consigns them to be minors all their lives, under their fathers, their husbands, their brothers, or whoever, '' Ms. Lowe-Morna said. Political leaders find it convenient to maintain dual legal systems, she said, ''because that allows you to sign up for all these progressive things but essentially do nothing on the ground.'' Stephen Lewis, the United Nations special envoy to Africa on AIDS and a campaigner against inequities between men and women, says women need their own version of Unicef, the United Nations children's agency. What is missing in the United Nations ''is a powerful women's international agency that emerges and just takes the world on,'' he said in a recent interview. ''Nobody is responsible,'' he said. ''There is no money, there is no urgency, there is no energy.'' Instead, he and others say, international donors typically promise to consider women's issues when designing aid programs, a well-meaning notion that often ensures that those issues are sidelined. Only two objectives aimed at women and girls -- reducing maternal mortality and eliminating the gap between girls and boys in schools -- are included in the United Nations' development goals for the next decade. The United Nations' own Economic Commission for Africa in February delivered a downbeat assessment of the progress by African women, stating that gains in women's political mobilization, advocacy and government representation ''are not yet reflected in substantial changes in the lives of ordinary women.'' In a part of the world where modern mores often collide with ancient traditions, women themselves are sometimes divided over what constitutes progress. Some advocates for women say their movement has come together over continentwide needs to promote peace and reduce violence against women. Beyond that, unity is often elusive. In Uganda this year, hundreds of Muslim women protested legislation that would have banned polygamy and female genital cutting, guaranteed equal rights in marriage and divorce and raised the legal age of marriage to 18. One in six Ugandans is Muslim. The Ugandan Parliament shelved the bill, which had been in the works for nearly 40 years. South Africa's debate over virginity testing was not unlike women's rights battles elsewhere. The issue pitted officials from South Africa's Commission on Gender Equality against Zulu leaders, male and female, who saw the legislation as an attack on ancient tribal culture and family values. Joyce Piliso-Seroke, who heads the commission, urged Parliament to ban virginity testing outright. The public inspection of girls' genitals, she argued, was humiliating, the conclusions about their virginity were slapdash and medically unreliable, the stigmatization of girls who failed the test was a lifelong blow and the public identification of virgins an invitation to rapists because of a myth among African men that sex with a virgin can cure AIDS. Not least, she said, she rejects the notion that it is acceptable to pass judgment on the virtue of girls while ignoring the morals of boys. Educating boys and girls, she argued, is a better weapon against AIDS. Zulu leaders, however, called virginity tests a revered tradition ideally suited to address modern ills. King Goodwill Zwelithini Zulu called the tests an umbilical cord between modern Zulus and their ancestors. In Pietermaritzburg and in Durban, hundreds of bare-breasted women and girls in traditional Zulu short skirts and beaded necklaces marched in opposition to the ban. Inkosi Mzimela, the chairperson of South Africa's House of Traditional Leaders, an assembly of tribal chiefs, called the legislation outrageous and warned that communities would defy it. Even South Africa's deputy president at the time, Jacob Zuma waded into the debate last year. Mr. Zuma, a Zulu, personally attended a virginity-testing ceremony, endorsing the practice as a way to shield African values against the corrosive effects of Western civilization. ''This is none of the government's business,'' said Nomagugu Ngobese, a Zulu virginity tester in Pietermaritzburg who says she has identified rape victims and perpetrators of incest through testing. ''People are devaluing our things, but we are not going to quit. They must come and imprison me if they like, because this has helped our children.'' After voting to ban virginity testing entirely, Parliament backtracked this month, restricting tests to girls 16 and over who give consent. Carol Bower, the executive director of Resources Aimed at the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, which lobbied for the ban, called that ''an O.K. compromise.'' ''We don't think it is good enough,'' she said, ''but it is as good as it gets.'' In Lamontville, a busy township of plywood shacks and modest concrete dwellings, Jabu Mdlalose, a volunteer community health worker, holds a monthly virginity testing session. November's ceremony was also a coming-of-age celebration -- a sort of Zulu bat mitzvah sponsored by the families of two girls who had reached puberty, featuring prayers to ancestors, bathing in a moonlit river and the slaughter of a goat. Ms. Mdlalose, 42, donned a black-and-white beaded hat and settled on the ground under the red-and-white tent for the Saturday morning tests. ''We don't force them,'' she said, as the girls lined up. ''The girls want to protect themselves.'' A few girls attributed the turnout -- 57 in all, ages 5 to 24 -- to parental pressure. Many others said they enjoyed the camaraderie and took pride in the ritual. ''At first it was embarrassing,'' said Karabo Ngobese, 19. ''But you get used to it.'' If the new law is enforced, there will be no examinations without gloves, no white dots on the foreheads of girls deemed virgins. And there will be no 14-year-olds like Sibongile, who began the morning in buoyant mood and ended it hiding in the rear of the tent, insisting tearfully that, whatever her tester's judgment, she remained a virgin.

"7","Equal Status for Wives Urged By South African Legal Panel","Africa","The South African Law Commission, a legal review panel, recommended to Parliament today that it pass legislation giving wives equal status with their husbands. The proposals, viewed essentially as a charter of women's rights, seek a radical change in the present system, under which women are inferior marital partners in law. About half South Africa's wives are married under a property status that limits their legal rights. They cannot sign many commercial agreements or buy houses without their husbands' permission.",1982,"South Africa"
"8","ZIMBABWE STILL DIVIDED ON RIGHTS FOR WOMEN","Africa","The friend of a newly widowed woman traveled to her home to offer sympathy. When the visitor arrived, the widow asked if she could borrow cups, saucers, spoons and forks to serve the other expected guests. The family of the widow's husband had taken most of her belongings. Under traditional law, they were entitled to do so. This incident was recalled by a lawyer in this southern African city to illustrate the low status of women on the African continent and the overwhelming influence of cultural values in a nation that is struggling to create greater equality for women. When the Government of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe passed the Legal Age of Majority Act in 1982, the law was hailed as a major step toward winning women's rights. It gave women over age 18 more equal legal status, transferring the right to arrange marriages from the parents to the daughter, allowing women to own property apart from their husbands and to enter into business contracts. Ideology Versus Reality But four years later equal rights remain a distant concept. Both men and women, particularly those in the 85 percent of the population living in rural areas, have resisted the changes, viewing them as a challenge to their cultural values. The situation has the Government in a wrestling match between ideology and reality. Mr. Mugabe has a goal of social egalitarianism in his drive to make Zimbabwe a socialist, one-party state. But his governing political party receives vast support from tribal chiefs and others in the countryside, and Mr. Mugabe does not want to alienate them, some activists say. The intensity of the public's distaste for notions of equality was apparent in the negative widespread reaction against a recent Supreme Court ruling that found that fathers could no longer sue for so-called ''seduction damages'' from a man who impregnated a daughter over the age of 18. In effect, such payments would make up for the loss in the so-called bride's price, or lobola, a family might have received from a suitor had their daughter remained a virgin. Under the court ruling, the woman herself can sue. The Government has let the Age of Majority Act stand but has weakened it by leaving it open to interpretation in allowing women to decide individually whether the law applies to them. The result has been that traditional law remains overwhelmingly the norm among black people in this country. Whites remain bound by the civil laws fashioned for them when this nation was known as Rhodesia. Risk and Benefit Under the new law a woman arranging her own marriage can technically decide alone whether her prospective husband has to pay any money. But many parents or guardians maintain that claiming lobola is their conditional right - or else they might not approve of the marriage - and refuse to relinquish it. If the daughter takes a firm stand, she risks ostracism. It is a risk that few women want to take, according to experts on women's rights here, and it is still extremely rare for the bride's price to not be paid. At the same time, many women continue to view lobola as a symbol of worth and dignity in a male-dominated society that affords them little status. If the husband dies, leaves his wife in debt and leaves no will, traditional law allows his brothers or eldest son to take his estate and any minor children. The wife would then have to accept support from the extended family. The intent of the customary law was originally to insure that the widow was cared for by her in-laws and, in many rural areas, that is still the only practical means of support. But it can often mean that an urban professional wife is left with nothing. The Government is trying to develop a law that would define the distribution of property and block relatives from taking advantage of women.",1986,"Zimbabwe"
"9","FOR MISS NIGERIA, A BEAUTY CONTEST COMES IN SECOND TO LAW","Africa","Within hours of being crowned Miss Nigeria, Helen Prest made a radical departure from a long-held tradition in the beauty business here. She turned down a formal offer from the contest's sponsors to undertake a year of modeling and personal appearances in this West African country and abroad. ''My career,'' the 20-year-old Miss Prest said, ''comes first.'' She will soon graduate from law school, and when she is sworn in by the Nigerian Bar Association, Miss Prest will become the thirdgeneration lawyer in her family, one of the most distinguished in Nigeria. Her father, who received his legal training in Britain, is Michael Prest, currently chief of staff to President Shehu Shagari. Her grandfather, Arthur Prest, was Chief Justice and Nigeria's Ambassador to Britain. ''The sponsors of the contest wanted me to take a year off from school - but I suppose I'm too ambitious and in a hurry, and I didn't want to miss out on being a lawyer as soon as possible,'' Miss Prest said the other day. The contest was sponsored by The Daily Times of Nigeria. 'Society Is Complex' Miss Prest, whose accent carries traces of Britain, where she went to school, holds strong opinions concerning the role of women in Nigerian society. She asserts that, contrary to popular perceptions, the social structure here is ''not backward or conservative when it comes to giving women economic opportunities.'' ''Nigerian society is complex, as you can expect,'' Miss Prest said, ''and there are still men who won't agree with you when you ask that men and women should have equal rights, and equal pay for the same work. But women are far more liberated in economic opportunities in Nigeria than anywhere else - given the hard living conditions here, they cope amazingly. I challenge Western women to cope with life the way we do in Nigeria.'' While the lives of many women in this country of more than 90 million people are still shaped by ethnic customs, there are definite signs these days that cultural customs such as the purdah, polygamy and female circumcision are being questioned by women, especially those in urban areas such as Lagos, Nigeria's teeming, rambunctious capital city. Women's action groups regularly hold well-publicized seminars and conferences on development, and their representatives demand of President Shagari's administration greater say in legislative matters. A handful of women were elected last year to Nigeria's newly formed House of Representatives, and of the 48 million voters who were registered for the national and local elections in Nigeria's 19 states, nearly 60 percent were women. Women in the largely Moslem northern section voted for the first time in last year's elections. At the Middle Levels Miss Prest herself notes that an increasing number of women are getting into law (more than a tenth of Nigeria's 4,000 lawyers are women) and that more and more businesses are hiring women as executives. In particular, foreign businesses that have representations here - such as the French automobile manufacturer Peugeot - are giving a high priority to employing women in middle levels of management. Nigeria is black Africa's most populous, powerful and prosperous nation, and because of its oil wealth the nation is experiencing rapid economic growth. And there are many people here, including Miss Prest, who contend that opportunities for qualified women will also be increasing. There is also the ''domestic'' economic sector, the flourishing Nigerian bazaar, that is dominated by women who are known as ''market mammies.'' These women now have a 10,000-member organization known as the Lagos State Association of Market Women. There is general agreement that without the work of these women, Lagotians would never have adequate food to consume. The ''market mammies'' organization lobbies for better working conditions for its members, and for such amenities as child-care centers, according to its president, Modupe Caxton Martins, whose husband is a former judge. Recently, Mrs. Martins and her association established a ''model market'' in the Surulere section of Lagos, a structure that cost $7 million and was built by the Lagos City Council. Nevertheless, says Miss Prest, there are still some traditional practices in Nigeria that inhibit the economic and personal development of women. A recent study commissioned by the International Federation of Women's Lawyers said that although Nigerian women are given all fundamental rights under the new American-style constitution, they sometimes do not enjoy the same status as men. Specifically, the study noted, a single woman in Nigeria has more independence under the law than a married one. An unmarried woman of at least 21 years of age can sue and be sued, is liable for her debts, can buy or sell property in her own name, and can work or live where she likes. But once the same woman is married, under civil law she cannot control her own property, cannot obtain loans or a passport -without the consent of her husband. 'Things Are Bound to Change' ''But things are bound to change for the better,'' Miss Prest said, noting President Shagari's commitment to women's rights.  She sees a legal career as a takeoff point for a career in politics. Her graduation from the University of Ife, nearby, will not mean, however, that she can begin to practice law right away. First there is the compulsory ''national service'' of three years - urban youth are required to live and work in villages as part of a government plan to get youths to understand more about different parts of the country and different styles of living. Meanwhile, the modeling and other lucrative offers pour in. Among the prizes Miss Prest won after being crowned Miss Nigeria was a $20,000 Peugeot, $12,000 in cash, several wardrobes, color television sets and a guarantee that she would receive a hefty percentage of royalties from the use of the contest pictures in which she was portrayed. There is also tennis to play, and there is representing her university in track meets; Miss Prest runs 100-meter, 200-meter and 800-meter races. And, eventually, there is marriage. (''It is necessary,'' she says, ''no one can live alone.'') But now there is her career.",1980,"Nigeria"
"10","NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; A French Minister","Africa","A group of feminists gathered the other night at Betty Friedan's to meet Yvette Roudy, the French Minister for Women's Rights. She's here preparing for the international world conference on women, to be held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1986. When asked about her accomplishments since 1981 in the cabinet of Francois Mitterrand, she listed furnishing her new ministry's office building, educating women about contraception and getting abortion reimbursed under the national health insurance. Her bill, to prohibit images of men or women that are degrading, got stuck in the National Assembly, she said. She also told the group that single parents are better off, under French income-tax law, living together rather than marrying. In France, the status of women living this way is called concubinage. Mrs. Roudy said that the serious financial problems under Mr. Mitterrand are having ''a terrible effect on women.'' Six percent of the unemployed are men, 12 percent are women.",1984,"Kenya"
"11","ISLAM: FEMINISTS: VS. FUNDAMENTALISTS","Africa","''You're wrong - in Islam it is not a must that you wear the veil,'' argued Ekbal Baraka, a member of the Cairo-based Arab Women's Solidarity Association. An Iranian woman shrouded in black, a picture of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pinned over her heart, shot back, ''You are a Westerner, you are not a true Moslem, you have lost your soul.'' Miss Baraka, who gave a long paper on the Islamic veil at an informal workshop last week as part of the United Nations Decade for Woman Conference, said as she walked away, ''Well, at least I tried to convince her.'' The brief verbal clash, on the great lawn of the University of Nairobi, illustrated that Moslem women came to Nairobi not only with different agendas and strategies but also with different interpretations of Islam. Throughout the Islamic world, the surge of fundamentalism is reshaping the roles and redefining the rights of Islamic women as Sharia, the 1,300-year-old Islamic code of law, penetrates more legal systems. Many Moslem women wholeheartedly embrace the fundamentalist movement. But a growing number of feminist professionals in Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Morocco, among other Moslem countries -as well as in India - are waging all-out war on what they see as less of a revival of Islam than a reassertion of patriarchy. Throughout the Moslem world, feminists are clinging to civil laws that, while not granting them full equality with men, guarantee some protection, especially in family matters such as divorce, child custody and polygamy. They are even beginning to challenge the assumption that religious interpretation is the domain solely of old male religious leaders. ''The problem is that the province of researching Islamic law has been dominated by men - and really not progressive men,'' said Rashida Patel, a feminist lawyer and vice president of the All-Pakistan Women's Association. ''Women are exposed to misinterpretations of Islam by the religious leaders and are led to believe in their inferior status and limited role.'' Dr. Patel's organization has struggled to retain secular laws and obtain new ones to guarantee rights for women without contravening Islam because of pressure to Islamicize the country. Her group is lobbying to keep a 24-year-old family law, for example, that establishes legal procedures for divorce and restricts polygamy. Religious leaders have attacked the law as un-Islamic. Her group has opposed laws that challenge or exclude the evidence of women in court and that make adultery and fornication crimes. It fought and won the right to keep women as judges. ''We are fighting a double battle - fighting to keep the laws we have while trying to make women aware of their rights,'' she said. In many countries, what is considered Islamic is muddled with local customs and traditions. In Bangladesh, a feminist lawyer named Sigma Huda helps educate rural women about their legal rights and the teachings of Islam through songs, comic books and plays. ''Men play upon the religious sentiment of the people, and the people believe it is Islam when it's a custom or a tradition,'' she said. ''Islam is the only progressive religion that states, 'If you don't find any laws in the Koran, go to the teachings of the prophets and if you don't find anything there, then use your brains to figure out what would God want.' '' For her, Islam is a religion that must constantly grow. To that end, she has proposed a council where the ulema, or religious leaders, would sit together with lay experts to try to adapt Islam to the 20th century. ''They say it's impossible to bring in a new school of thought and I say, 'Why not?' '' she said. This month in Egypt, after Islamic fundamentalists had a progressive 1979 family law overturned on procedural grounds, Parliament approved a law permitting wives to divorce their husbands on the ground of inadequate support or affection. But Egypt still allows polygamy, makes divorce easier for men than for women and allows a man to prevent his wife from traveling or working. ''Those religious people want to be the only ones who interpret Islam,'' said Mervat el-Talawy, a delegate from Egypt who is acting as a third-world spokesman. ''We are trying to stand up to them in not letting their intepretation prevail,'' she said. ''Otherwise, they will stabilize all society.'' This view is not shared by many Moslems here who adhere to a rigid interpretation of Islam. They believe it is their religious duty to spread this truth to all nonbelievers. ''The Old Testament is a false book and the only book of the prophet is the Koran,'' Fazia Abdullah, a Kenyan Moslem, said in the midst of a circle of Moslems on the grass at the University of Nairobi. ''I am trying to make people see the truth - good or bad - sweet or bitter.'' ''Women only ask about polygamy and divorce,'' Shohreh Moghimkhan, an Iranian in the group, said. ''Why is it so? Islam has lots that can liberate women from imperialists and oppressors. With the dynamic principles of Islam, we were able to overthrow the regime of the Shah.'' The conference gave many African Moslems their first opportunity to meet Arab and Persian Moslems. The Iranians impressed some, alienated others. ''They're fantastic,'' said Nimo Suleiman, a 20-year-old Kenyan secretarial school student who took two weeks off to attend the conference. ''They're doing a wonderful job, a perfect job.'' But Mariam Omar Hassan, a convert to Islam from the Kikuyu tribe in Kenya who spent three and a half days getting to Nairobi via boat, train, bus and taxi, said: ''I didn't like the Iranians at all. I'm embarrassed by them. They're a wrong interpretation and a wrong role for women in Islam. Women are meant to be a soft-spoken, gentle force.'' Conspicuously absent are Saudi women. Saudi Arabia did not send a delegation, perhaps because Saudi women are not allowed to travel without a male relative or because Saudi's strict interpretation of Islam imposes restrictions on women that would have made it hard to defend women's equality. Saudi women are not allowed to drive a car, mingle with men or leave home without covering their heads, arms and legs. At the official United Nations conference, Arab countries joined forces with the Vatican representative to invoke religion and cultural traditions to change paragraphs in the draft of the final conference document. Jordan, Syria, Cuba and the Vatican proposed changing a paragraph calling for legal elimination of ''discrimination against unmarried mothers and their children born out of wedlock.'' Delicate negotiations followed. Iraq said the Koran demanded that children of unmarried women be provided for. The committee agreed on a compromise that substituted ''single mothers and their children,'' eliminated references to unmarried mothers and out of wedlock children, and added the phrase ''without prejudice to the religious and cultural traditions of countries.'' Religious and cultural traditions were also invoked in killing a proposed amendment on the right of women to control their own lives and bodies. The fundamentalist surge has come so fast that many leading feminists don't know how to respond. ''It's a trend all over the third world, a means of certain groups to push their identity, in part a refutation of Western civilization,'' Suzanne Mubarak, Egypt's First Lady and the head of her country's delegation, said. ''It's not an easy phenomenon to understand - even for us.''",1985,"Kenya"
"12","Widows' Wail; Zimbabwe's Disinherited Women and Children Rebel at Tradition","Africa","IN ZIMBABWE'S Shona language, mutorwa means ""outsider,"" and it is used by Zimbabwean women activists to describe a woman's position there. A woman is forever an outsider, I was told. In her husband's home, she is expected to be subservient and is considered a transient by her own family, since she is expected to marry and move out. Upon her husband's death, a woman risks finding herself disinherited by the husband's family. In these cases, the wife is harassed by her husband's relatives, who demand insurance policies, bank books and pensions and even evict the widow and her children from their home. Throughout southern Africa, the issue of inheritance is an important barometer of women's status in society. In Zimbabwe, a network of women's rights organizations has made considerable headway in changing the laws that govern inheritance, and their efforts could provide a model for the growing women's rights movement in the region. The movement has much work to do. Many Zimbabweans were astonished to hear President Robert Mugabe lash out not long ago at women who seek joint property rights with their husbands. ""If these are ideas being brought by whites amongst you as they came from Europe, they are bringing terrible ideas. I cannot have it that property that is family property should be registered in two names. If the woman wants property in her own right, why did she get married in the first place?"" Until quite recently, the laws relating to marriage and inheritance in Zimbabwe were based on racial classification, with civil law applying to whites and customary law to blacks. According to the African Marriages Act, any black African who died without leaving a will was subjected to the requirements of customary law, which meant that the widow had no right to inherit her husband's property. Instead, an heir would be appointed by the husband's family, usually the first-born son, who would take charge of the estate. While such customs are rooted in traditional practices from rural, communal settings, they have been distorted and manipulated in the modern, urban setting. All too frequently, women and their children find themselves disinherited upon the death of their husbands and badly mistreated by the husbands' families. ""People become opportunistic, and take under the guise of custom, though it is far from custom,"" says Julie Stewart, a law professor at the University of Zimbabwe. ""Unless women know what they are entitled to and will fight for it, the old order prevails."" Courts have recently ruled that any couple -- black or white -- that marries under civil law should be subject to the same law upon their death. However, many people are unaware of this change; moreover, the deceased may have married several women under different marriage laws, and problems arise concerning what different wives and children should inherit. The situation is especially acute fo r women in urban areas, who have virtually no social welfare, no access to land and no skills to seek employment. Tiisetso Makhurane, a legal aid attorney who deals with many such cases, conceded that there is little recourse available for these widows. ""We can only write to the heir and advise him about his duty to maintain the spouse in her house. We appeal to his sense of morality."" Cases of dispossessed widows abound. Some are rural, illiterate farmers; others are educated professionals. Dorothy, a 29-year-old widow with three children, earns her livelihood by farming and selling her produce in town. Her husband's eldest son from a prior marriage became the heir -- and informed her that she would not receive any of her husband's estate. With the assistance of Women in Law and Development in Africa, an independent women's organization, Dorothy filed a claim. Last August, the court ruled that she and her children were entitled to part of that money. Nancy is a 37-year-old widow working as a nanny in Harare. After seven years of marriage, which produced two daughters, her husband took a second wife and had another two daughters. When he died, all four children were taken by his family, who believed that the children belonged to the husband's family, since they paid the lobola, or bride price. ""I kept quiet,"" Nancy remembered. ""If you asked [Patrick's family] about anything, they gave you a hard reply .  .  . . 'He bought everything by himself, so why are you asking about it?' "" The inheritance issue is also hard on children. I was told about one case where a widow with six children was stripped of her assets by her husband's eldest brother. When she died, the family learned that her children were destitute and homeless. The argument for perpetuating the customary system revolves around cultural practices, but women's groups are beginning to challenge these beliefs. ""Who really knows what this tradition and culture is really all about?"" says Judith Chikore, who directs the Zimbabwe Women's Resource Center and Network in Harare. ""What is considered to be tradition is often what supports men's superior position."" In 1993 the government issued a white paper suggesting ways to reform inheritance law and soliciting public comment. Women's rights groups have been involved in education campaigns to gather opinions on reforming the laws, and although responses have only come from a tiny percentage of the population, they reflect a wide range of views. Some in fact support the present law and the continuing practice of polygamy. The early years after independence in 1980 saw significant legislation in the area of women's rights. The most significant step was the 1982 Legal Age of Majority Act, which for the first time made women over the age of 18 majors in the eyes of the law -- before this, women were perpetual minors. When trying to change deep-rooted attitudes toward women, activists realize that they are in for a long struggle. Most of their work remains limited to the urban areas, and even there it is a difficult task. Silvia Fundire, a sociologist with the Women's Resource Center, describes how she became aware that even the belongings in her home weren't considered hers: ""After I got married, everything we acquired in our house belonged to my husband. I was always reminded that lobola had been paid -- that I had been bought."" Her husband's family, she says, made her leave the room when they discussed family issues, even those involving her child or her property. Silvia, though, remains hopeful, even while aware of the amount to be done. ""There is a danger to get frustrated, to feel like you are in an endless, dark tunnel, because you are dealing with attitudes."" Judge Enoch Dumbutshena, the first black chief justice in Zimbabwe, saw the president's outburst in August as symptomatic of the broader problem. ""The attitude of men, both urban and rural, was epitomized by Mugabe's remark: If you want to be equal and share property, why would you get married? The tradition is perpetuated because the majority of women don't understand that they have rights, other than the traditional ones."" Janet Fleischman, Washington representative of Human Rights Watch/Africa, was recently on sabbatical in Zimbabwe.",1995,"Zimbabwe"
"13","African Kingdoms Reward Virgins; Youth in Uganda, Swaziland Targeted in Fight Against HIV","Africa","An African kingdom has a plan to stop the spread of HIV. It's going to revive an old tradition of rewarding virginity. Those who remain virgins into their early twenties will get a gift to launch them into adulthood -- for men, perhaps a few head of cattle; for women, a refrigerator or stove. The Buganda kingdom, the largest of Uganda's traditional monarchies, is putting a modern spin on old-time morality -- an approach kingdom officials say is needed in a country where the HIV-infection rate has hovered around 10 percent since the mid-1990s. The details, such as at what age young people will be asked to take virginity pledges and how long the pledges will apply, are still being worked out. There is also the question of how to pay for the rewards -- a major obstacle for the kingdom, which is a cultural institution under Ugandan sovereignty and has no political or tax-raising powers. However, some details -- such as how to make sure young people who sign on remain chaste -- have already been covered. ""We're going to test the girls,"" said Robert Ssebunnya, the kingdom's health minister. ""In the case of boys, I guess we will have to trust them not to lie."" The Buganda kingdom isn't the first African monarchy to use tradition as a tool to stop HIV. It's an idea with growing appeal in Africa, where dealing with the disease has become a facet of daily life for almost everyone. ""What we're seeing in parts of Africa is communities responding to the epidemic by saying, 'Let's see what's in our culture -- how can we deal with this with what we had in the past?' "" said Suzanne Leclerc-Madlala, a medical anthropologist at the University of Natal in South Africa. ""And what they had most of the time was a way of regulating sexuality,"" she said. In the tiny southern African kingdom of Swaziland, a return to tradition has worked out as a five-year ban on sex for young women. The ban was decreed in September by King Mswati III, who ordered young women to wear tassels, a traditional Swazi badge of virginity, around their necks. Under Mswati's decree, men may not touch young women -- even handshakes are taboo -- and the women cannot wear jeans or trousers. Violators face steep fines. The Swazi plan has been criticized for its focus on young women and severe restrictions on contact between the sexes. The Buganda kingdom is hoping to avoid similar criticism with a gender-neutral approach to virginity and a nod toward contemporary mores. ""We're not telling young people they can't go on dates, not to dance or hold hands,"" Ssebunnya said. ""We're just saying maybe you shouldn't have sex. That way you won't get sick, you won't have children before you finish school."" The medical community has dismissed virginity testing as pseudo-science, and some say it violates women's rights, but Ssebunnya rejects such criticisms. ""We have our own way, a traditional way, of testing,"" he said, declining to elaborate. To bolster the abstinence drive, the kingdom is writing a sex manual and expanding the traditional role of ""sengas"" -- aunts. Sengas customarily counseled their nieces on wedding night etiquette and other wifely roles. Under the new plan, the kingdom will appoint sengas for whole communities, where they will teach young people -- boys and girls -- about sex and the virtues of avoiding it. Buganda was an independent kingdom that was absorbed into Uganda when the country gained independence from Britain in 1962 and was abolished after it tried to secede in 1966. The kingdom was restored, along with two other monarchies, nine years ago on condition they stick to cultural affairs. But in a country where the influence of Western culture is growing and sexually charged U.S. soap operas like ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" are among the most popular television shows, can an old African virginity tradition be revived with a cow and a stove? ""Faced with rapid social change of any kind it's pretty well documented that people look to the past for answers,"" said Leclerc-Madlala. ""But it means going back 200 years and recreating social structures that don't work anymore. . . . The traditions died for a reason."" Regardless, Buganda officials, led by King Ronald Muwenda Mutebi, are pressing ahead. They've begun promoting the virginity campaign and say it will be implemented by the end of the year. Officials say they're confident that the campaign will catch on among the kingdom's subjects, who make up about 17 percent of Uganda's 24 million people. So far, however, the reaction among young people appears mixed. ""Staying a virgin means respecting our culture,"" said Rose Orishaba, a 16-year old student in Kampala, who plans to sign a virginity pledge. ""It keeps us safe from disease."" A few classmates, mostly boys, loitering outside between classes giggled at the word ""virgin."" ""I'd wait until I was older; sex isn't good for us,"" said Cesar Katalega with a sarcastic smile. ""You just want the cow,"" shouted a friend, Timothy Sembatya. A few of the boys standing around laughed. ""I'm not waiting to have sex . . . this is for old people.""",2002,"Uganda"
"14","Sisters of the 'Punch'","Africa","PUNCHED -- that's what a woman may get if she is too visible or independent at the University of Dar es Salaam, the national university of Tanzania. Not punched with a fist, but punched with intimidation, lies, public humiliation and shunning. Nor are university women alone in such harassment. Tanzania can be a backward and nasty place for women. The leader of African socialism, Tanzania has made tremendous strides in feeding its people, in education and in health care. Yet its government allows the continuing subjugation of women, as is common in much of Africa. In the past the ""punch"" was a political tool by which Tanzanian students criticized state, party and university leaders who, in the students' view, had abused their positions or made bad decisions. Posters bearing a likeness of the person were placed around the campus, and the individual's ""crimes"" were reported. Several years ago, the university expelled all radical students after their campus demonstrations spilled into the capital's streets. The punch was taken over by a secret group of male engineering students. Since then, it has been used exclusively to punish university women who are too visible, successful or outspoken. Sometimes a woman's only ""crime"" is to have refused sex to a member of the punch group. Or she may have attended afternoon tea in the university cafeteria, a privilege the men have reserved to themselves -- no small matter in a food-scarce country. The punched woman's likeness and biographical information are posted, along with lies about her sexual relationships. She is shunned by women and men students, both for the fabricated charges and for fear of being punched themselves for not cooperating with the punch. The punch is very effective in terrorizing women students. A university woman rarely speaks in class. If she has an answer to a question, she whispers it to a man and he repeats it to the teacher. If a woman is compelled to speak in class, her answer is usually inaudible. Women walk on campus and board the university buses with their heads bowed, never daring to raise their eyes lest they appear too bold. Not only does the university allow this ugly situation to continue, but some authorities clearly must be assisting the punch group. At a university where chairs and even textbooks are lacking, where paper and ink are in desperately short supply, where reproducing equipment is strictly controlled by the teaching units, the punch group simply could not publish its attacks without help from one or more officials. Punching is just one of the more blatant examples of official tolerance of, and complicity in, oppression of women in Tanzania. National military service is compulsory for all secondary-school graduates, male and female. Women told me that in the army they are frequently subjected to sexual harassment by the male officers, and those who refuse to provide sexual favors are subjected to extra calisthenics and similar forms of military punishment. The legal position of women in Tanzania is about at the level it was for women in England and the United States in the late 1700s. In Tanzania today, married and divorced women have no rights to property -- even property they brought into a marriage as a dowry. Child-custody rights belong to the father. I knew of a woman whose husband was persuaded by his family to divorce her because the couple had had no children. Later they discovered that she had in fact been pregnant at the time of their separation, but the father won custody of the unborn child even though he had abandoned the mother. Newspaper reports of women beaten to death by their husbands were commonplace, yet I never saw mention of programs to alleviate the problem. Women are not permitted to join the Revolutionary Party (the only party), without the permission of their husband. Leadership in the government and the party is held by men. The one woman who emerged as a national leader from the independence era of the 1950s was purged and discredited long ago. Certainly no gallantry is afforded to women to compensate for their inferior economic and social status. When a bus pulls to a stop, the young men -- fast and fit and traveling light -- push and shove their way on board and get all the seats. The women follow, encumbered by pregnancy, a toddler, baskets of food, a chicken, or by old age, and stand in the lurching, overcrowded bus. The strictness of class lines between males and females begins in childhood. A family leaving a hotel provided a classic image. The woman carried two enormous suitcases and had a baby strapped to her back. The little girl struggled with a huge basket of clothes. The man carried a small paper bag about large enough to hold an apple. The boy carried nothing. It is not news that in Africa women do most of the backbreaking work of feeding, warming and sheltering the family, hauling water and wood, pounding grain, remudding houses, hoeing, harvesting. It has been estimated conservatively that 80 percent of all work in rural areas is done by women. But what may be surprising is that, in a country which has proclaimed itself socialist, the status of women commands so little attention internally or from the outside world. In most socialist countries, the role of the state and the party in improving the status of women is usually thought to demonstrate the political or ideological integrity of the leadership. But in Tanzania, the darling of European social democrats, the status of women and the party's role seem to be non-issues. Tanzania is perhaps the most extensively researched country in black-governed Africa, yet in all of this massive literature there is relatively little on the subject of Tanzanian women. And though Tanzania has been held up as a model of African socialism, its economic policies seem to have no regard for women. As the primary producers in agriculture, women are especially hurt by government pricing policies that are squeezing the peasantry. The state and party confusion over the role of women is reflected in the official press. The government paper, the Daily News, frequently has articles stressing that the appropriate place of women is in the home as wife and mother. One such article featured a photo of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher picking up the milk bottle delivered to her door at 10 Downing Street with a caption praising her for keeping up with her wifely chores. Another profiled a woman colonel in the Tanzanian People's Defense Forces who, it emphasized, was a model Tanzanian wife at home and, in particular, was very soft-spoken. Yet Tanzania clearly wants to convey a different public image of its policies on women's issues. During the United Nations meetings on the International Women's Decade in Arusha, Tanzania in December 1984, the Daily News ran several articles on women in agriculture that read like something straight out of a U.N. publication. The Revolutionary Party -- Chama Cha Mapinduzi -- is equally ambivalent on women's issues; theory and practice are widely divergent. The party uses popular culture to advance its message, and performances by the national dance troupe are a big attraction. I saw the group on several occasions: the visit of North Korea's vice president, the triumphal return of Tanzanian President Nyerere after his selection as head of the Organization of African Unity, and the ceremonial running of the Mwenge, the torch that is the symbol of Chama Cha Mapinduzi. For such great occasions, the troupe has a repertoire of songs and dances that express modern themes on a traditional motif. Some are moving expressions of a people's love for their country. But most have a single theme, taken in its most physical meaning: boy-gets-girl. At the end of almost every dance, the men jump on the women in a very explicit, aggressive way (except, interestingly, in the performance for the North Korean visitors).  It is supposed to be a big joke. Everybody laughs. The theme of male sexual dominance is paramount. This is the message of the Revolutionary Party translated into art. In the government and the party, in the university and the army, in property and custody laws, in the arts, in family life, in every facet of social life, the Tanzanian leadership perpetuates the inferior status of women. Tanzania may be considered the leader of African socialism -- and rightly so in view of its many accomplishments -- but its women still live under oppressive conditions.

"15","The Women's Movement Comes to Cape Verde","Africa","With her delicate neck stretched stiff to head-balance the heavy can, the young girl formed a common, sex-determined African tableau of female water fetcher. Here in the semi-arid outskirts of Mindelo on Sa Vicente Island, she stood out more than her mainland counterparts because of the desolate severity of the landscape. If drawn further into the social traditions of her gender, the centuries-old route for the overwhelming majority of poor women throughout the Cape Verde Islands, she can expect to give birth to her first child in her first year of menstruation, give birth every year after that (except when nature protests with a natural abortion), raise a family without a husband, grow muscular working hard alongside men for pay, fetch water daily until her body gives out, and die in her early forties. ""There is no doubt that Cape Verdean women, like all African women, have been the victims of discrimination,"" said the island-nation's first woman judge, Vera Duarte, 28.  ""That is why we've begun a women's movement.  We intend to change these things quickly,"" Duarte and her fellow activists in the Cape Verdean Women's Organization, founded last March, may be overly optimistic about the speed with which they will be able to bring social change to this economically depressed and conservative nation, but they have assertively challenged the heretofore unquestioning acceptance by women here of a subservient position to their men. Such a challenge is a singular phenomenon anywhere in Africa. In a blunt appraisal of the relations between men and women, Duarte wrote in a March issue of the government weekly, Voz di Povo (People's Vice), that the Old World European attitudes of the country's former Portuguese rulers degraded women to a level where they had no legal recourse to resist sexual abuse, ""irresponsible paternity"" and serve as a source of ""cheaper (sometimes free) manual labor."" Today, women are still often their children's sole source of support, Duarte wrote, as the men here produce ""a high number of offspring in great disproportion to their economic means of support."" One foreign aid official here said that 50 percent of Cape Verde's rural households, where 90 percent of the country's 300,000-person population lives, are headed by women. Felix Monteiro, the 71-year-old retired director of finance for the country and a manuscript-collecting amateur historian, agreed with Duarte's assessment of male domination of women here.  Monteiro, however, argued that it grew out of not only Portuguese traditions, but the African culture brought here by mainland slaves beginning in the 15th century.  ""African males have been just like men everywhere,"" Monteiro said. One writer has said that the Cape Verdean family structure eveloved out of African polygamy traditions and the islands' harsh economic realities. Limited economic opportunities and a history of cyclical droughts have for years forced as much as 70 percent of the male population to emigrate overseas for work.  The wealthier peasants who remained behind saw children as economic assets from farm work and often had several ""families"" with as many as 25 to 30 children.  At the same time, women, who were not given as much education as men, became 60 percent of the rural labor force, a position they hold today. And while the ""socialist"" independence government that came to power in 1975 professes to support equality between the sexes, a reporter was told when looking at the construction of dozens of rock catchment dams in rural areas of Santiago Island, just outside the capital of Praia, that women were earning substantially less than the men for the same backbreaking work.  The men, some of whom were doing less work than the women, earn $1.56 a day while the women are paid $1.04. ""This is one of our major concerns,"" responded Cape Verdean President Aristides Pereira, when asked about the difference.  ""We intend to stop this as soon as possible because this is discrimination, nothing more."" But Pereira said his government would have to move slowly in equalizing pay scales or face a male revolt.  ""The men, the farmers, have a strong resistance to women being paid the same as them and say it is not possible,"" said Pereira. ""We are trying to gradually diminish the difference and convince the men that it is not right. ""Our aim is to facilitate and support [the women's equal rights] struggle,"" Pereira continued, ""but we think it is a struggle like any other struggle.  The Cape Verdean woman has to struggle to achieve equality."" According to Vera Duarte, ""it is not only a difference of pay scales.  Here the men have been accustomed to beating us and nothing being done about it, to leaving the women with the responsibility of the babies."" Under the Portuguese, laws existed to rectify such abuses but were not enforced because of colonial paternalism, Duarte said. Today there are new laws that are being enforced, such as jail (three months maximum) or humiliating public censure for men who beat women and mandatory financial support payments for children, she said.  ""In six years, the enforcement of these laws has changed the relationship between men and women for the better,"" Duarte added.  ""I am an example of change, because before independence I could not have become a judge."" A University of Lisbon graduate and the relatively privileged daughter of a middle-class Cape Verdean merchant and nonconformist mother, she became a judge in March 1980. ""We will be emancipated here when we tread underfoot the degrading practices we were formerly sujected to and still are subjected to,"" Duarte added.  ""I still believe it can happen quickly.""",1981,"Cape Verde"
"16","For Women, Polygamy's Just a Rotten Deal","Asia","To the Editor: I can't wait to translate ""My Husband's Nine Wives,"" Elizabeth Joseph's May 23 Op-Ed article on polygamy, into Urdu and Pashto and send it to some of my girlfriends in Pakistan. It's sure to bring tears to their eyes -- both of laughter and rage. The institution of polygamy is legal in Islam, but most Muslim countries, under the pressure of women's rights groups and others interested in strengthening social welfare, have since the 1960's placed legal restraints on its practice. These include requiring the prospective polygamist to obtain the written consent of his first wife before marrying a second. This consent is rarely given. Every instance of polygamy I knew in Pakistan led to a great deal of unpleasantness within the families involved, and one ended tragically. It's ironic that as women in Muslim countries struggle to hold on to whatever social advances they have won in sweat and pain, an American woman should extol plural marriage. The legitimacy of polygamy in Islam originated in the need to provide legal and social protection to widowed women and their children, as well as to unmarried women with little chance of finding a spouse, when Muslims were few in number and severely persecuted by the pagan Arabs among whom they dwelt. The Prophet Mohammed demonstrated by his example that it was honorable to marry women who had previous husbands (one of the habits of the Prophet less emulated today by his supposedly devout followers). The Koran is explicit, however, in making polygamy conditional on a man's being able to provide equally for all his wives, a theoretical possibility that is highly unlikely in fact. No woman anywhere needs a co-wife. What she needs is a husband who will pull his own weight. Contrary to Ms. Joseph's supposition, in monogamy the husband of a busy wife need not microwave his dinner. He can cook it himself and get up a little earlier, if necessary, to make breakfast for the kids. Marriage needs to be a joint endeavor. What Ms. Joseph describes in her household sounds like a lot of mules hitched to one wagon. Let's not prosecute her arrangement, but let's not make it legal. Too many women and their children in this country will suffer, as they do already in many parts of the globe. SARAH AKHTAR Flushing, Queens, May 23, 1991",1991,"Pakistan"
"17","Books of The Times; Status of India's Women Offers Hope and Despair","Asia","May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons A Journey Among the Women of India By Elisabeth Bumiller Illustrated. 306 pages. Random House. $19.95. A believer in the Indian concept of rebirth would surmise that Elisabeth Bumiller had indeed been an Indian woman in her previous birth, so deep is her empathy with India and so pervasive the humanity that emerges from her book on India's women. Yet she never glosses over harsh realities; she makes no excuses for the disheartening events she reports. Her title, ''May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons,'' is well chosen. Ms. Bumiller eventually came to regard this blessing, conferred on Hindu women at the time of their wedding, as a curse and the cause of much that is wrong with the status of India's women. In a series of essays with eye-catching yet accurate titles (''Wedding First, Love Later: Arranged Marriages Among the Educated Classes''), she explores various aspects of women's lives in India. This is a profoundly moving book, one that plunges the reader into despair and yet gives glimpses of hope. The attempt to give an overall picture of the 400 million women of India is a formidable undertaking. Over half the book is concerned with issues that affect women of the middle class, a term used in India to describe the top 10 percent of the population, 80 million people. The remaining essays concern the 75 percent who live in the villages; Ms. Bumiller spent time in an Indian village as the guest of a farmer's wife. India is a country of paradoxes, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the status of women. India has no trouble conceiving of the divine as feminine; men and women, wealthy and poor, worship powerful goddesses like Durga and Kali. Yet this same India has caught the attention of the West with its infamous ''bride burnings'' or ''dowry deaths.'' The two extremes coexist. In Indira Gandhi, India had a woman as the leader of the nation, and today women account for 10 percent of the Indian Parliament (compared with 5 percent in the United States Congress). But as Ms. Bumiller writes, ''For every woman who sits in Parliament or has done a Ph.D. or goes to the Supreme Court to argue a case, you have thousands in the villages who don't even know about their basic rights and that they are equal citizens.'' From ancient times and for a multitude of reasons, Indian women have never had equality with men. Certainly one reason for the oppression was the paramount importance placed on preserving caste distinctions and lineage purity. Women have been glorified in Indian literature and in sculpture and painting, but the reality seems to have been otherwise. In modern times, the complacency that arose from having a woman in the highest office of the land was shattered by the 1974 Government report on the status of India's women. The report, ''Toward Equality,'' revealed that in many ways conditions for women had actually regressed since independence. It was the catalyst for an Indian women's movement, which, like the feminist movement in the United States, was founded by the elite. Few Indian women, however, would call themselves feminists, a label regarded with suspicion. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, the first woman to be President of the United Nations General Assembly, would deny being a feminist, yet she was intensely aware of equal rights. Asked by a reporter after her election to describe the sari she was wearing, she promptly countered, ''Did you ask my predecessor to describe his suit?'' Ms. Bumiller's insightful study of arranged marriages illustrates her problems in coming to terms with the Indian woman's easy acceptance of such a system. She ultimately rationalizes that modern arranged marriages are, in fact, not much unlike America's dating services. Her essay ''Flames: A Bride Burning and a Sati'' includes potentially explosive material: Statistics indicate that the annual number of dowry deaths is higher than the deaths from terrorist activity in the Punjab. Ms. Bumiller suggests that the consumer boom of the last two decades, spurring the greed for economic status symbols, is in large measure at the root of the problem. Investigating female infanticide in ''No More Little Girls,'' she views the practice ''not as the act of monsters in a barbarian society but as the last resort of impoverished, uneducated women driven to do what they thought was best for themselves and their families.'' The essay entitled ''Indira Is India, and India Is Indira'' raises the question why Mrs. Gandhi largely ignored those of her own sex. Ms. Bumiller says the Prime Minister made no special effort to promote other women and comments that she ''transcended sexual categories''; but she never tries to answer the question. The final essay, on the failure of population control in India, lays the blame largely on the debased status of women and a family's overwhelming desire for sons. The only success story is in the southern state of Kerala, where 70 percent of women are literate (three times the national average); they have a partnership role in marriage and a voice in deciding the number of children they will bear. Overpopulation aggravates every major problem India faces, and Ms. Bumiller concludes that the status of women must be improved because ''the future of India'' depends on it.

"18","Women Face Increasing Bias As China Focuses on Profits","Asia","The capitalist-style changes in China over the last dozen years have made almost everyone richer, but in some ways they have also made life more difficult and more frustrating for the nation's 565 million women. As Chinese society focuses more on profit than on equality, and as Communist morality loses its influence, women are in some cases losing the ground they gained in the Maoist years. More now than under Mao Zedong, they are being discriminated against in jobs, in housing, in land allocation. Physical attractiveness has become a crucial factor in hiring women. Women are increasingly used as ornaments in the office, or as lures to bring in business. Fewer Women in Top Jobs The proportion of women in the most powerful positions has declined. And traditional practices that the Communists had essentially eliminated, like the selling of women as wives, have reappeared on a significant scale. New technologies like ultrasound testing allow couples to know the sex of a fetus -- and they often get an abortion if it is female. ""Everyone has benefited from the reforms, but men have moved ahead at a faster pace than women,"" said Tao Chunfang, deputy director of the Women's Research Institute, an official organization in Beijing. ""This is China, where the man has always been the focus of the culture. China has glorified the man for several thousand years."" Viewed as a Commodity The glorification goes on, in new ways. In Shanghai in May, at the opening banquet of the Metal Exchange, a new commodity futures exchange, 50 attractive, seductively dressed women were brought out after dessert to dance with the guests, of whom perhaps one-third were women. ""These days if you're a woman, you're as good as a commodity,"" a Chinese businesswoman said. ""You're either worth six pounds of gold or two tons of aluminum."" Chinese attitudes toward women appear fraught with contradictions and complexities. Women face greater economic opportunity than they did under Mao, but also more discrimination; they may drive buses and taxis, but they usually take only one-third of the spots in universities; they enjoy excellent maternity benefits, but they are the first workers sent home with part pay in times of economic austerity. There is no doubt that economic liberalization under Deng Xiaoping has enriched China's women, along with its 599 million men, and neither group would wish to go back to the Maoist days when men and women alike wore shapeless gray tunics and toiled equally hard for equally miserable wages. In the 1990's, China's women continue to gain in many ways: maternal death rates are declining, women are running successful businesses, and many factories give preference to young, unmarried women in manufacturing toys, clothing and other products. When Mao and his fellow Communists took power in 1949, they imposed far-reaching measures to improve the status of women, like eradicating prostitution, child marriages, the use of concubines and the sale of brides. The number of women in the industrial labor force soared, from 600,000 in 1949 to more than 50 million, or 82 percent of urban women today, compared with 29 percent in 1949. The gains gave women a measure of economic independence and self-confidence. Effects of Western Advertising To be sure, discrimination existed even under Mao. But in those days factories and offices had little autonomy, and they were not much motivated by market economics, so they tended to observe central guidelines against sex discrimination. And society was so prudish that it was scarcely possible to take note of sex differences -- everybody wore similar clothes, and cosmetics were effectively banned -- so that it would have been most un-revolutionary to regard women as ornaments or to comment about their appearance. But with the collapse of Maoism, the traditional male-dominated nature of Chinese society has reasserted itself. At the same time, Western approaches to advertising -- using images of beautiful young women to sell products -- have been imported since the early 1980's, along with pinups and pornography. As a result, discrimination against women today in many factories and offices is not only more widespread but also more blatant than in Maoist days. When a young woman who had just graduated from a prestigious university in Beijing applied for a Government job, the official who interviewed her said he would hire her -- on condition. She would have to agree not to marry and have children for three years. ""If you don't agree, they don't want you,"" said the woman, who rejected the offer. ""But if you do agree and you don't keep your promise, then they'll fire you."" A woman who graduated from a university last year with a degree in economics is teaching aerobics classes because, she says, only her male colleagues received decent job offers. ""They wanted me as a secretary or they didn't want me at all,"" she said. In response to the bias against women, the Government passed a law this year, effectively an equal rights amendment, to protect women from discrimination in employment, housing, politics, education and other areas. The law takes effect in October, and in the last few weeks, the official press has been energetically promoting the law and informing women about the powers and rights it gives them. That the law emerges after a dozen years of China's policy of opening and economic restructuring, however, suggests a significant awareness of women's rights. Such an awareness did not exist before, even under Mao, and still does not exist in many other developing countries. But some critics say that since the law has no mechanism for enforcement, it will be effective mainly as a tool for educating women, particularly in rural areas, about their rights. The law also suggests an admission that inequality persists -- something that any woman looking for a job takes for granted. At a fair to recruit 180 Government employees in June, 80 percent of the openings were open only to men, the official China Daily newspaper said. The newspaper said the same proportion of jobs was reserved for Communist Party members. Top party and Government posts are not only overwhelmingly male but also becoming more so. In 1978, on the eve of the economic liberalizations, two women served on the Politburo; now, none do. In that year, 6.3 percent of the Central Committee members were women; now, only 5.7 percent are. Three Government ministers are women, but their portfolios are areas like ""chemical industry"" and ""family planning"" and they have little power. Officials acknowledge that there are not enough women in important positions, but say that there are not enough women with the training and backgrounds necessary to assume power. ""The quality of women is still very low and we just can't compete,"" said Wu Baoyu of the All China Women's Federation, the most prominent women's organization. ""We can't just give women a quota and say that you must put women here or there. Women must work hard to educate themselves and study science and technology. Only then can women compete."" Ms. Wu works with the organization in the coastal city of Xiamen, one of China's most open and economically advanced areas, where the Mayor is a man and his six deputies and senior economic officials are all men. Factories Prefer Women But women in the Xiamen area and around the nation have improved their position in industry. Factories sometimes prefer to hire women for delicate handiwork on assembly lines, making watches, shoes, radios and other products. Women constitute nearly 60 percent of workers in such rural enterprises, said Qiao Xueying, another official with the women's organization. Rural women also raise ducks, chickens and pigs for sale on the open market, sometimes bringing in more income than their husbands. But women in the countryside face difficulties that their urban counterparts do not, like illiteracy and the lack of education. Seventy percent of China's illiterates are women, and one-third of women between 15 and 45 years old cannot read a newspaper. (China does not publish statistics on the illiteracy rate of women more than 45 years old.) Some women never make it through grade school, and poor education contributes to other social problems that hinder their progress. More and more women these days are being bought and sold as wives, a practice that had apparently been stamped out in the 1950's but has reappeared, primarily in rural areas, because of the loosening of social controls. Traders kidnap women or deceive them into thinking that they are being taken to a wonderful new job, and then sell them to male peasants. Women also tend not to get much allocated land. When the rural communes broke down in the early 1980's, the land was distributed primarily among the men in each village -- and the practice continues today. Wolf-Whistle Culture In urban areas, people live in apartments provided by their employers, but companies and offices normally provide housing only to men, since the idea is that women will get apartments through their husbands. While some discrimination, as in housing, existed even during the Maoist era, women in those days were not regarded as sex objects -- because femininity was essentially banned. Now, the return of short skirts and the rise of the advertising industry have nurtured a wolf-whistle culture. The emphasis on economic efficiency and making money has also made women less desirable as employees. Employers say women run home early to look after the children or take days off to take children to the doctor. Moreover, employers complain that maternity benefits make women more costly as workers: after giving birth, Chinese women receive 90 days to one year of leave at full or partial salary. ""Women bear children and this influences the amount of time they can devote to work,"" said Chen Yiyun, a sociologist who researches family and marital problems at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""Unfortunately, sex discrimination has been brought in by the market economy.""",1992,"China"
"19","Pakistan Provides Legal Safeguards","Asia","To the Editor: I share Asia Watch's concern for women in Pakistan and agree with Dorothy Q. Thomas and Patricia Grossman (""Pakistan's Women Suffer Special Abuse,"" letter, Aug. 20) that if there is any case of brutality against women, it must not go unpunished. Nor must police brutality against men be condoned either, and I wonder why the writers restrict their sympathy to women in detention. Men make up the overwhelming number of those in detention in Pakistan; women are an insignificantly small proportion of the number of prisoners. This was the finding of Pakistan's leading feminists and human rights lawyers, Asma Jehangir and Hina Jilani (""The Hudood Ordinances,"" 1990), whom Asia Watch has relied on heavily in its report, but whose statistical data it has ignored. For instance, in 1988 there were only 657 women prisoners in Punjab. The law in Pakistan not only provides safeguards to prevent harassment of women at masculine hands, but it is also tilted to the extent of reverse discrimination. For instance, a female constable's presence is a legal requirement at the time of a female's arrest. Moreover, a woman in Pakistan cannot be charged with the offense of adultery. Under Section 497 of the Pakistan Penal Code, only a man can be punished, and in all such cases ""the wife shall not be punishable as an abettor."" The draftsmen of the Pakistan Penal Code did not intentionally expose women to the risk of being accused of adultery, as they are in Western Europe and America. The legal bias in favor of women has been extended. Last May, the Government amended the Criminal Procedure Code so that women can no longer be remanded in police custody. This was done to eliminate the possibility that police officers might harass women. Thus I find it startling that Ms. Thomas and Ms. Gossman state so sweepingly that the law courts discriminate against women. In making out a case of repression under ""Islamid"" (Hadood) laws, the Asia Watch report acknowledges its reliance on the publication by Asma Jehangir and Hina Jilani. But those investigators found that of the total of 26 hadd cases (until 1988), only 3 convictions were upheld by the Appellate Court. Asma Jehangir's finding is that in no instance has a hadd punishment been carried out in Pakistan.

"20","Case of Bangladesh Writer Opens Old Wounds; She Endangers Women","Asia","To the Editor: Your July 16 front-page article on the furor over Taslima Nasrin in Bangladesh notes her failure to attract sufficient support from her feminist and literary peers in the country. From my experience of doing anthropological research in Bangladesh villages in the 1980's, I can understand why many of her peers think that by expressing some extreme views in not-so-tactful language, Ms. Nasrin has given Muslim fundamentalists opportunity to mobilize themselves on a common platform and has thus endangered causes, including women's rights, that others have worked for years to achieve. In my discussions with groups of villagers, particularly women's groups, in a rural area of Bangladesh where more than 50 percent of reproductive-age women were using modern family planning methods -- a unique success story for a poverty-stricken, mostly illiterate Muslim community -- I was surprised at how women could openly talk about their defiance of local mullahs in family planning and other matters. Even an Islamic educational organization called Al-Waisia was propagating family planning and trying to empower orphan girls and boys by providing them vocational education. The situation was in sharp contrast to that in Pakistan and many other Muslim-dominated countries, where rural women and men did not dare to challenge the local clerics. Many nongovernmental organizations -- Grameen Bank and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee being two of the foremost -- have done admirably since Bangladesh's liberation from Pakistan in advancing the causes of women. It will indeed be unfortunate if some provocative writings and statements of Ms. Nasrin resulted in a backlash of social and political domination of Muslim fundamentalists in Bangladesh.

"22","Beijing Meeting Signals Women's Solidarity","Asia","To the Editor: Contrary to the headline over Camille Paglia's Sept. 1 Op-Ed article, the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing is not ""A White Liberal Women's Conference."" In a phone call I had with Bella Abzug, who is in Beijing representing the Women's Environment and Development Organization, she reported that from 60 percent to 70 percent of the women participating in the parallel Non-Governmental Organizations Forum are from the developing world, including the several thousand N.G.O.'s accredited as observers at the official United Nations conference. In comparison with other United Nations events, the official government delegations as a whole have a majority of women, also from the third world. Ms. Paglia, who has carved a niche for herself as a pseudo-feminist critic, outdoes herself in again bashing Western feminists and misrepresenting their views. It is presumptuous and insulting to imply that third world women have to be told by outsiders what their problems and needs are. Her description of the official Platform for Action as ""a maelstrom"" of clashing ideologies overlooks that the document, like all United Nations documents, reflects the consensus views of its 185 member nations as well as women N.G.O.'s from every region. The broad range of recommendations indicates the diversity of life experiences and needs that are addressed and the multicultural sensitivity of the platform. It is also a tribute to the mutual support and growing solidarity among women's movements around the world. It is true that the document does not single out for praise men who wash dishes, change diapers and help around the house, which is pretty much a Western phenomenon and not even prevalent there. The theme running throughout the Platform for Action is not female dominance, but partnership and equal sharing of rights and responsibilities between the two sexes. A parallel theme is that as half the world's population, women must have an equal say in policy making. Ms. Paglia does hit a sympathetic chord with me when she deplores the lack of references to male suffering and deprivations. I have long advocated that the equation of masculinity and manhood with war-making, aggressiveness, violence, wifebeating, rape, sexual abuse and all the other horrors that dominate the world's cultures should be challenged by the men (probably a majority) who do not commit these acts. It's time for the many men around the world, both public figures and private citizens, who are peace-loving, caring, responsible and socially concerned to organize their own conferences to reject the popular stereotypes of how ""real men"" are supposed to behave and to provide, in cooperation with women, new definitions and positive models of manhood. One question they might discuss is why are men, whether in repressive China, in our country or the other United Nations member countries, so angry and fearful at the concept of sharing power equally with women?

"23","Beijing Says Women Have It Better in China Than in U.S.","Asia","In a detailed report on the status of women, Chinese authorities assert that women enjoy more personal safety, greater career opportunities and better legal protection in China than in the United States. The report was an apparent response to criticism of China's human rights record by Hillary Rodham Clinton and other participants at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women being held here. It argues that even though ""certain groups in the United States"" have attacked China over the status of its women, the Chinese Government has taken a far more progressive stance toward women than has the United States. ""The position and conditions of Chinese women are in no way inferior to the situation of the women in the United States and are indeed much better on the whole,"" said the report, issued late Friday by the New China News Agency. Although the report is defensive in tone, there is some basis to the Chinese report. Since the Communist revolution in 1949, women have advanced far in Government positions, as the report asserts, and have achieved equal status in the home in many urban families. If few women have reached the very top ranks of the governing Communist Party -- there are no women on the 20-member Politburo and only 12 in the 189-member Central Committee -- they have been promoted further in mid-level government positions than American women have. According to the New China News Agency report, whose statistics may not be entirely accurate, women account for 31 percent of all government employees in China, compared with only 22 percent in the United States. It said that Chinese women in senior managerial posts, defined as directors of enterprises or institutes, also outnumber their American counterparts, 10 percent versus 3 percent. Another obvious difference, apparent to anyone who has visited here, is women's physical safety. Incidents of violent crime against women are far rarer in China than in the United States, and women generally feel safer walking alone on a city street here late at night than they do in the United States. Domestic violence against women is also believed to be far lower in China than in the United States, although many such incidents in China go unreported. Less relevant, perhaps, are the report's arguments that a greater number of Chinese women vote and are elected to local councils than in the United States, because elections in China are generally staged and because the legislatures almost uniformly follow instructions from the Communist Party. China's Constitution, the report also argues, specifies equal rights for women, which the American one does not. But China's Constitution also grants its citizens freedom of speech and assembly, rights that are not always respected. Yet China's modern Government was established with a clearly stated aim of achieving equal status for women, never an official aim of the American Government. And with a legacy of heavily traditional attitudes toward women when it came to power in 1949, the Chinese Government has faced an uphill battle. ""China is faced with more difficulties than the United States when it comes to enhancing the status of women,"" the report states. With relations between the United States and China still strained, former President George Bush met President Jiang Zemin in Beijing on Friday, and the New China News Agency reported today that Mr. Jiang said that Washington must take the initiative to improve ties. ""We have noticed that recently the United States restated that the U.S. Government will continue to follow the 'one China' policy,"" Mr. Jiang said, according to the report. ""China pays great attention to these statements by the U.S. side, but promises in words are not enough.""",1995,"China"
"24","Agreement in China","Asia","The tumult and the shouting have died down. China, the host country for the Fourth World Conference on Women, has incurred contempt for its ham-handed security measures. But despite the distractions, the conference produced a final declaration that represents an important advance toward guaranteeing the same rights for women that have long been enjoyed by men. Ten days of debate in Beijing yielded a document that can show the way to changing legal, economic and educational policies in countries where women are denied equal rights. It was not easy to reach agreement, and the delegates can take quiet satisfaction in the common ground that was found. There was a real sense of exhilaration for those who came from the world's poorest countries, using their life's savings to get to Beijing. The Beijing final declaration states firmly that women have the right to decide freely all matters related to their sexuality and child bearing, and forthrightly condemns forced sterilizations and forced abortion. But the document involves much more than reproductive rights. It speaks of the systematic rape of women in wartime and says its perpetrators should be treated as war criminals. It rightly labels as human rights violations the genital mutilation of girls, attacks on women with too-small dowries and domestic battering. It warns of discrimination against girls, even before birth in some countries, all over the world. At a time when domestic budgets are strained in many countries, the conference was unable to win financial commitments from governments to create new programs for women. But it did elicit pledges from many to redirect national budgets into established programs. Furthermore, it called on governments to insure women equal rights to inherit from their families -- an uncommon practice in far too many parts of the world. The conference delegates hoped to achieve global recognition of the proposition that giving women power involves not only their ability to control fertility but also their opportunity to get an education and a job, and that women's rights are human rights. The final declaration moves the world a step closer to that goal.",1995,"China"
"25","Chinese Women Can't Claim Equality","Asia","To the Editor: Re ""Beijing Says Women Have It Better in China Than U.S."" (news article, Sept. 10): The contention by the Chinese Government that ""the position and conditions of Chinese women are in no way inferior to the situation of the women in the United States and are indeed much better on the whole"" is ludicrous. While the social and economic status of women in the United States is still far from satisfactory, it is hardly government policy here to round up women and force them to have abortions or to be sterilized; to imprison and torture them (often with electric shocks applied to the teeth and genitalia) for participation in peaceful political demonstrations; to unleash dogs upon them while they are held in custody; to sentence women to forced labor for having sexual relations outside of marriage, or to harass and intimidate the wives and female relatives of dissidents. These documented practices are taking place in China -- persecution is particularly cruel in Tibet -- and not just to a few women but to thousands. And this is to say nothing of rape and sexual abuse during detention, which theoretically violate Chinese law but occur regularly. One need not be a zealous American patriot to find the Chinese claim outrageous.  WILLIAM F. SCHULZ Exec. Director, Amnesty Intl. New York, Sept. 11, 1995",1995,"China"
"26","Kuala Lumpur Journal; Blame Men, Not Allah, Islamic Feminists Say","Asia","Are Muslim men allowed to beat their wives? Are men and women equal before Allah? These provocative questions form the titles of two pamphlets issued by a Muslim feminist group here, and they are at the center of a debate in Malaysia over putting a new domestic violence law into effect. ""For 14 centuries the Koran has been interpreted almost exclusively by men,"" said Amina Wadud, an American Islamic scholar who joined the women's group, Sisters in Islam, while teaching here. ""It is only in the past two decades that women have begun to say, let's look at this text and come up with our own conclusions,"" she said, ""and voila, some of them are not the same as what the men came up with."" A multiracial nation whose official religion is Islam, Malaysia is seeking to define itself as a liberal role model in the Islamic world, offering wide latitude for its Chinese and indigenous minorities and their religions. On the bustling streets of Kuala Lumpur with its glass-fronted skyscrapers, the mosques and discos stand side by side and women in Muslim headscarves chat easily with women in jeans or miniskirts. But some rules set apart the Muslim majority, and it is primarily the women who are affected. Though its legal system is secular, Malaysia's Muslims are required to take family issues to Islamic courts, where women generally have fewer rights in questions of divorce, child custody and alimony as well as little recourse in cases of rape or domestic abuse. ""They tell the woman: 'Go home. Everything will be taken care of. Everything will work out,' "" said Zuriah Aljeffri, an artist who is a leading member of the women's group, ""and she will get beaten again."" Since the passage last year of a national law against domestic violence, Muslim clerics have argued that the law does not apply to their courts, which vary in stringency among the 13 state jurisdictions. ""We know there is a problem,"" Hamid Othman, the minister for religious affairs in the office of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, conceded recently. ""We just need time to study how to implement it."" Sisters in Islam has taken the lead in lobbying for universal enforcement of the law, arguing, in its pamphlet on domestic violence, ""It is not Islam that oppresses women, but human beings with all their weaknesses who have failed to understand Allah's intentions."" Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim recently added his voice to theirs, saying that under the jurisdiction of Islamic courts, ""women are tortured, abused, tormented and abandoned without alimony."" ""Islam is built on the foundation of justice for all,"" he said. ""When the implementation of these laws is associated with men's prejudice against women, then we are in for a lot of trouble."" In this fast-modernizing nation, where women play a growing role in the economy and society, feminism and strict Islamic observance are increasingly at loggerheads. ""We find no contradiction in our desire to be strong, independent, modern women and to be good Muslims as well,"" Zainah Anwar, a member of the women's group, said at a conference on women and Islam last month. But not everyone agrees. During the past decade, fundamentalism has gained momentum among some of Malaysia's Muslims. In a recent example of the fundamentalist trend, the state of Selangor issued restrictions on video-game parlors and Karaoke bars to combat ""moral degradation."" And the state of Kelantan barred women in Government service from wearing lipstick. Kelantan has been in the forefront of this trend since the Malaysia Islamic Party, an influential opposition party, gained political control in the state six years ago and began to create its own more stringent model there of an Islamic state. Its Chief Minister, Nik Aziz Nik Mat, has outlawed gambling, restricted the sale of liquor, required special permits for carnival rides, dances and beauty pageants, banned unisex barber shops and instituted separate men's and women's lines at supermarket checkout counters. ""Enough is enough,"" said Norani Othman, a sociologist who is a member of Sisters in Islam. ""Let's start learning from the West."" Though they reject what they call the extremism of some Western feminists, Sisters in Islam has become an insistent voice here, holding seminars, conferences and small demonstrations and publishing two heavily annotated books of interpretations of the Koran. ""Oh, yes, we are quite serious about our Islamic law,"" Ms. Aljeffri said. Ms. Othman added, ""We have to be careful to identify what is the cultural heritage of the Muslim societies of the Middle East and what is Islam itself."" Given Malaysia's relatively open society, both with regard to non-Muslim religions and to the status of women, she said her group is well placed to take a leading role in an international Islamic women's movement. ""I do feel that here in Malaysia we have slightly more space to do this because we have a less patriarchal system,"" she said.

"30","Unicef Is Fighting Violence Against Women","Asia","Unicef began a global campaign today against homicidal violence against women in cultures where laws and society fail to protect them. A number of organizations are focusing on the issue as they meet in New York for two weeks to assess progress five years after the largest international gathering of women -- from the grass roots to governments -- assembled in Beijing to share their hopes and grievances. They refer to the violence as culturally sanctioned homicide. ""This is a violence that is almost sanctioned,"" said Carol Bellamy, the executive director of Unicef. The campaign begun today, International Women's Day, will focus on acts like""honor killings,"" dowry deaths, female infanticide and acid attacks. In some countries, even when laws defending the right of men to use violence against women are repealed, the culture that created them continues to exert a tremendous influence over behavior, these groups say. The situation is worst across a swath of countries stretching from the Mediterranean to the edge of Southeast Asia, especially Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. ""There's violence everywhere, there's gender discrimination everywhere,"" Ms. Bellamy said. ""But South Asia -- when we assign people there they come back raving feminists in six months."" United Nations agencies and thousands of local groups have found that the path toward better lives for the most oppressed women leads inevitably to a collision with laws favoring men, leaders of the groups say.  And they contend that that may explain why some countries never develop to their full potential Almost all of the violent attacks on women are technically illegal. But some recent information compiled by Unicef, with the help of grass-roots organizations, indicates that they continue. They found that in Bangladesh reported acid attacks on women and girls -- often by men or boys they had rejected -- rose from 47 disfiguring assaults in 1996 to more than 200 in 1998. In India, more than 6,000 ""bride burnings"" or other dowry deaths were reported in 1997. The women died because they did not bring what in-laws considered satisfactory dowries or, sometimes, because the grooms were not happy with brides chosen by their families. The State Department, in its latest annual survey of human rights, published on Feb. 25, said about 10,000 cases of female infanticide were reported in India annually, not counting an unknown number of abortions to avoid giving birth to girls. ""Unicef is a children's agency,"" Ms. Bellamy said, ""but you can't deal with children without the implications of the parents, particularly the mother. ""The issue of child survival is already compromised if you're talking about a mother who is malnourished in the first place. As a child she's less well taken care of than a boy. She leaves school early for early marriage. ""She's very often physically abused, and so much of that abuse comes in the family. She doesn't get adequate prenatal care."" Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's Health Coalition and a former Ford Foundation representative in Bangladesh, said that many societies where unrestricted male power is misused evade the issue by using culture and religion as a cloak. ""In the last couple of years, female genital mutilation came to public consciousness and there was a sense of horror about it,"" Ms. Germain said. ""This year's topic seems to be honor crimes, and the tendency to blame them on a particular religion, namely Islam. This is not a religious phenomenon. It has to do with male dominance, patriarchy and power."" Pinar Ilkkaracan, the founder of the Turkish organization Women for Women's Rights, said in an interview here that the West was sometimes simplistic in holding religion responsible for women's problems in Islamic countries. Ms. Ilkkaracan said she had to tone down her work recently because it was being portrayed by outsiders as an Islamic issue. She argues that culturally sanctioned violence against women is a Mediterranean phenomenon and that even in Spain and Portugal it was unofficially condoned until those two countries joined the European Union. The machismo of Latin America, she contends, has its roots in Iberia. In New York, Equality Now, which aids women's groups around the world, is involved in a drive to lobby governments to rewrite or repeal laws that discriminate against women. The United States, where citizenship laws can discriminate, is not exempt from scrutiny. Monique Widyono, co-director of the group, says that women are increasingly focusing on the international agreements that governments have signed and then ignored. ""We are calling for accountability."" she said. ""The message now is: sign a document and be accountable.""  http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"China"

Remember, India had a woman as prime minister as early as 1966. Throughout history, many women in India have risen to prominence in politics, government, science and literature.

"33","Women, Extremism and Two Key States","Asia","There have been two recent reminders of the cost of extremism. In Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai signed a law that effectively sanctions marital rape. In Pakistan, a video surfaced of the Taliban in the Swat Valley publicly flogging a young woman screaming for mercy. Pakistan's government compounded the indignity on Monday by giving in to Taliban demands and formally imposing Shariah law on the region. Such behavior would be intolerable anywhere. But the United States is heavily invested in both countries, fighting Al Qaeda and the Taliban and financing multibillion-dollar military and development programs. The cases represent an officially sanctioned brutality that violates American values and international human rights norms. They also sabotage chances of building stable healthy societies in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, particularly venal politics are at work. Mr. Karzai, whose popular support plummeted because of government ineptitude and corruption, is running for re-election in August. The new law, which affects family matters for the Shiite minority, seems a bald, particularly creepy, pander. It says of Shiite women: Unless she is ill, ''a wife is obliged to fulfill the sexual desires of her husband.'' That is licensed coercion. If let stand, we fear such rules -- reminiscent of decrees issued when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan in the 1990s -- could also have a negative impact on laws affecting the majority Sunni population. Instead of defending the law as he did, Mr. Karzai must ensure that it is rewritten to reflect principles of freedom and dignity for women. In Pakistan, the video of the woman's flogging proves the bankrupt nature of the army's strategy. Failing to defeat the Taliban on the battlefield, the army tried to appease them with a peace deal in February. It ceded the insurgents control of Swat, 100 miles from Islamabad, and allowed free rein for their repressive ways. The woman was beaten after declining a Taliban fighter's marriage proposal, the head of the Peshawar Bar Association told reporters. After resisting for weeks, President Asif Ali Zardari capitulated to political pressure and signed a regulation formally imposing Islamic law on Swat as part of the peace deal. We seriously doubt this will bring peace, and it will certainly not make life better for Pakistani women. It is unlikely that Mr. Zardari's wife -- the slain former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto -- would have ever consented to such a craven sellout. The one encouraging sign came last week, when Pakistan's recently reinstated chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, publicly rebuked the attorney general and other officials at a court hearing for inaction in the flogging case. We hope this was not just grandstanding and that he and his supporters will find a way to make as powerful a case for this victim's rights as they did for Mr. Chaudhry's return to the Supreme Court. Many Pakistanis have wasted their time decrying the video as a conspiracy intended to defame Islam and Pakistan. They should be demanding that the army -- Pakistan's strongest and most functional institution -- defend against an insurgency that increasingly threatens the state. Like their military and political leaders, Pakistan's people are in a pernicious state of denial about where the real danger lies.",2009,"Pakistan"

"35","'Attractive Women' With Limited Power","Asia","BEIJING - Mao Zedong once famously declared that ""Women hold up half the sky"". But maybe that should be ""Women hold up one-fifth of the sky"", with female representation in China's legislature, the National People's Congress, stuck at just over 20 percent for decades. As I report here, women's rights are stalled in China and in some important respects are rolling back. Still, fired up perhaps by March 8, International Women's Day, China's state-run media is putting out a slew of images of ""attractive women"" at the legislative meeting, and this one of ""Beautiful female journalists"".  (Thanks to New York Times reporter Edward Wong, @comradewong, for pointing that out.) Meanwhile, these women in Shanghai may be risking broken ankles by running a ""High Heels Race"" for March 8. It all seems a far cry from the goals of the century-old International Women's Day, which are to celebrate the ""economic, social and political achievements"" of women, according toits website . After the 1949 Communist revolution, the Chinese state pushed for women's rights. It was a mixed blessing - women were expected to labor outside the home, like men, but did everything at home, too. Attitudes didn't really change. Yet they gained freedoms that today are under threat as the state pulls back from its early promises and long-repressed cultural values surge back. At a weekend seminar on feminism in Beijing, part of the Bald Girls art exhibition,  Song Meiya, a senior editor at the China Women's News, published by the All-China Women's Federation, described the situation today as ""disastrous.""

"36","Are Men Useless? (Government Says Yes)","Asia","Are men useless, at least when it comes to caring for a family? India's recent draft food security bill, currently in front of Parliament, seems to suggest so. The bill proposes a radical shift -- it requires that women become the ""heads of household"" for the purpose of issue of ration cards. A man would only be an acceptable household head if there is no woman over the age of 18 in the family to assign the ration card to. India has about 330 million families who rely on ration cards. Currently a head of household, for ration card purposes, is defined by family members themselves. According to the provisional figures of the last census (2011) only 10.35 percent of the total households are headed by women. The change was proposed after a look at some hard facts, some of which have been recognized as early as the 1970s. The International Food Policy Research Institute discovered through its studies that agricultural productivity increases dramatically when women get the same amount of inputs men get, such as access to education and to labor, fertilizer. Other studies show that when women control household resources they are more likely to benefit children than when controlled by men. Studies from India too suggest that men are more likely to spend aid money on non-essential items such as alcohol. ""Women contribute as much as 90 percent of their income towards their home while men tend to spend their income on non-essential items such as alcohol,"" Bina Agarwal, director of the Institute of Economic Growth, said. N.C. Saxena, a member of the National Advisory Council, points out another issue limiting men trying to care for families: pride. Men don't or won't admit that hunger exists in their family because it hurts their self-image, Mr. Saxena argues. In countries as diverse as the United Kingdom, Mexico and Sri Lanka, food coupons are already directed at women rather than their spouses. The idea has global appeal. The microfinance sector has for long targeted women as participants not just to empower them, but also because research shows they use money for community-friendly projects and are more likely to pay the loans back. This year the United Nations has entitled the theme of International Women's Day as ""Empower Rural Women - End Hunger and Poverty."" In the current 56th session of United Nations Commission on the Status of Women the focus is on the work by women that is ""vital to the well-being of families and communities, and of local and national economies."" Increasingly, female-focused research and aid is no longer about women being the ""weaker sex"" in need of help, but recognizing their value as members of the household and community. In India, requiring households to put women at their head may not work, Himanshu, an assistant professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University who goes by only one name said. ""Women are reluctant to take up such positions, because they are seen as undermining the role of men,"" Mr. Himanshu said, based on his fieldwork. ""It creates friction within households,"" he adds. The idea of an official card with a lady's photograph on it and her signature or thumb print as the household head may not be acceptable to entire communities in India, reports suggest.",2012,"India"
"37","For Indian Women, Divorce Is a Raw Deal","Asia","Much has been written about divorce being on the rise in India, sometimes accompanied by hand-wringing about the egos and inflexibility of younger couples, who seem less willing than their parents to stay in marriages they are not happy with. National statistics don't exist on divorce in India, but some local records do show a rise. Still, some experts say the divorce rate in India continues to be artificially low, because of how biased the system is against women, who can be left financially destitute even if their husband is wealthy. ""Divorce rates have not increased as much as they should have,"" said Kirti Singh, who practices family and property law in India. The government is likely to consider a proposal later this week to amend the existing marriage laws in India. The amendment seeks to introduce the irretrievable breakdown of marriage, as a basis for couples to seek divorce. It also proposes to waive or reduce the ""cooling-off period,"" or mandatory waiting period before divorce can be granted, which can be six to 18 months. The Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill 2010 was first introduced in the upper house of Parliament, or Rajya Sabha, in August 2010. Ms. Singh, who says she has fought ""thousands"" of divorce cases in her 31-year career, is part of a group that proposes even more significant changes to India's marital laws, including the introduction of a new legislation which will give women the right to marital property. If this legislation is passed, ""women will become equal owners of property,"" she said. ""Within the existing system there is no such option for women."" Women in India stay in failing marriages for many reasons, Ms. Singh said. Most of these emanate from the social and financial pressures that divorced women are left to face. The courts can take several years to settle a case and often women cannot afford the several rounds of litigation involved. Even if a woman does go to the court, in most cases it is an ""uneven fight"" between a man and a woman, she said. ""Men have more access"" to the legal system in India, Ms. Singh said. Under the Indian legal system, a separation or divorce entitles a woman to ""maintenance"" from her spouse, in the form of financial support. The amount requires authorization from a court and is based on the income of the man. But it is the woman who has to produce evidence of her spouse's earnings before the court. In India, where tax authorities estimate just 3 percent of the population pays personal income tax, and ""black money"" or under-the-table cash is common, the man's actual earnings are often hidden, Ms. Singh says. Additionally, the wife may not have access to documents that prove what her husband earns, Ms. Singh says. Even if she does, the maintenance amounts are tiny. Citing courtroom experience, Ms. Singh says judges generally fix a share of 2 percent to 10 percent of the husband's annual earnings for maintenance amounts. When a woman leaves a marriage, unless she is very well to do, ""there is very little left to her,"" to be able to sustain herself, Ms. Singh notes. The property goes to the person in whose name it is, and in most cases assets are in the name of a man, she points out. While most recent media reports have focused on changing social values behind most divorces, a study authored by Ms. Singh to be published later this year finds more than 80 percent of the more than 400 separated or divorced women surveyed blame ""cruelty or domestic violence in their marital homes,"" for their split. Two-thirds of the women surveyed suffered from physical violence. The most common reasons for domestic violence were ""dowry demands, extra-marital affairs or a second marriage of the spouse and the suspicious nature of the spouse,"" the report states. The violence took place even though 87.92 percent of the women lived in extended families. The study, called ""The Economic Rights & Entitlements of Separated and Divorced Women India,"" was conducted by a team of researchers, women's rights activists and lawyers, for the Economic Research Foundation of India between October 2008 and September 2009 and will be published later this year. It surveyed 405 Indian women who were either separated or divorced or deserted. The women were randomly selected from cities, towns and villages in north, east, south and west of India in an attempt to understand what happens to women when marriages fail. Most women surveyed ""did not want a divorce even if they have faced violence in their marital homes as they feel both financially and socially insecure outside the marriage,"" the study finds. A large number of women ""live at the mercy of their husbands during the subsistence of marriage"" and even after a separation or divorce they are financially dependent on their natal family, the report states. The study points out : ""Not giving a divorce is also the only tool that separated women have to negotiate terms of settlement with their spouse as their legal rights are insignificant."" This is corroborated by the statistic, which shows that only 73 out of 405, or 18 percent women surveyed were divorced while 81.7 precent were separated. In more than 60 percent of the cases, women claimed that marriage affected their career opportunities, because they either could not work after marriage or were able to work in a limited capacity. In about 85 percent of the cases, separated women ""bear the burden of looking after their children single-handed.""",2012,"India"

Roy writes in The International Herald Tribune.  ""The triple talaq is a formula of repudiation,"" she writes. The first two times it is pronounced, it can be revoked, but the third time it makes a divorce binding, according to some interpretations of Islamic law. Although Ms. Khatun's husband repented the next morning, the head cleric of their mosque in Delhi insisted that the divorce was binding, she writes. ""According to his reading of Islamic law, Ms. Khatun would need to marry another man, consummate the marriage and then divorce before she could remarry her husband."" For more than a decade, ""Muslim women's organizations in India have been fighting for changes in the body of Islamic law that governs marriage, divorce and the property rights of women,"" she writes. But as the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board held its annual convention in Mumbai last week, ""the battle lines had never been so starkly drawn."" Although the Indian Constitution guarantees equal rights to all citizens irrespective of their religion, Muslims are governed by the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937. ""Attempts to apply a common civil code have often been viewed as interference in the practices of India's largest religious minority,"" she writes. The Personal Law Board is one of the country's more influential Muslim groups. Its chiefly male membership of clerics and scholars has rejected proposals to change Muslim personal law, and is opposing a demand by women's groups that marriages be legally registered, as is mandatory for non-Muslims. Zeenat Shaukat Ali, a professor of Islamic Studies at St. Xavier's College in Mumbai and the author of ""Marriage and Divorce in Islam,"" is blunt in her assessment of the current situation. ""We are asking for codification of the legal system within the framework of Koranic law,"" she said.

""It was only at 12 that I began to feel uncomfortable. Not about the abuse - I didn't know the term 'child sexual abuse' at 9 or at 12, and had no words with which to describe my discomfort with the 'games' he played - but about the silence that he demanded."" If my story saddens you, please think about this: It is neither new nor rare, nor was the man who abused me a monster, or in any way out of the ordinary. According to a 2007 survey (the largest of its kind in India) conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare, over 53 percent of Indian children have experienced some form of sexual abuse - including a slightly higher percentage of boys than girls. I am only one of many. And I was luckier than most; my abuser was not excessively violent. As I learned to acknowledge the abuse and to cope with the fallout, I made some unexpected connections, found good friends, found strong mentors, found help, found my voice again and built a happier, more free life. I'm breaking my silence today to make a point, not about abuse, but about the importance of consent in the present debate over women's rights and gender equality in India.

"40","Indian Women Need a Political Party","Asia","NEW DELHI -  In my latest column, I use urban India's extraordinary reaction to the rape and murder of a young woman in Delhi to argue that the nation's most ferocious battle is that between modernity and the powerful hold of the Indian village over society. The aftermath of the rape has, naturally, included much talk about how to make the country a better place for women. I do not believe that much progress can be made in this area without women coming into full conflict with Indian society. Such a conflict, if it has to be meaningful or effective, is possible only through electoral politics. What I am suggesting, more specifically, is that women should be directly represented in Indian politics - in the form of a political party that is entirely concerned with what matters to women. In my previous Letter From India, I had argued that what saves India is its politics, because many sections of society find representation in Indian politics. More than 300 political parties contested the last general elections, representing various concerns, biases and cries for justice. But women are not directly represented, which is baffling. The presence of a few powerful female politicians does give a sense that women are not insignificant to Indian politics, but this is deceptive. Beyond a point, female politicians in mainstream parties cannot afford to antagonize the men and the elders among their voters - the chief adversaries of Indian women. There has been much talk in India about reserving electoral seats for women, but such a reservation, if it ever were to be enacted, would still be controlled by male politicians through their wives, daughters and even mothers. Also, such a reservation is a condescension by the system that would not be required if women were to organize as a political force. Only a political party whose fate is tied to how women perceive it can begin to influence the system in a deep way. Women make up more than half the country's population, and they have a slate of grievances about how the nation treats them. These are issues that unite both highly educated urban women and rural women, who historically have not had enough opportunities to do what they please. Over the years several groups in India have been empowered through political representation. For instance, the Dalit community, formerly considered the untouchable caste, has been transformed through aggressive political representation - not by the willful reformation of the upper castes. Also, the reality of Indian politics today is that even political parties with just a few seats in Parliament influence the government to get their way. Women must begin to twist some arms to make India a better place. They must understand that the fundamental instinct of men, even of decent men, is not to concede too much power.",2013,"India"
"41","Menstrual Shame and Superstitions in India","Asia","To the Editor: ''The Taboo of Menstruation,'' by Rose George (Op-Ed, Dec. 29), sheds a welcome light on the unfortunate effects of menstrual superstitions and ignorance in parts of India. Unfortunately, similar taboos with similar debilitating outcomes exist in other regions saddled with the kinds of anti-women prejudices from which such practices are derived. And lest those of us from America and other technologically advanced countries become too smug in believing that we are liberated from the peculiar notions identified in the article, we need to recognize that many girls here grow up either uninformed or misinformed about the menstrual cycle and feel the same kind of shame or embarrassment about their periods. While it is heartening to hear about progressive efforts on the menstrual front in India, it is important to advance that cause in every country where girls are taught to feel that their bodies are tainted once a month. DAVID LINTON New York, Dec. 29, 2012 The writer, a professor of communication arts at Marymount Manhattan College, is editor of the newsletter of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research. To the Editor: Rose George is to be commended for bringing ''The Taboo of Menstruation'' to a broad audience. It is just one of myriad issues that women and girls are facing today in India. Sexual abuse, rape, and lack of proper nutrition, access to education and counseling are keeping millions of women and girls from reaching their potential and are in clear violation of their human rights. The public demonstrations now taking place in India, over the death of a woman who was gang-raped, are bringing global attention to these issues. India has contributed to and driven globalization in the areas of culture, technology, literature and research. Now attention must be turned to those women and girls who have so much potential, yet are being left behind economically. ELIZABETH HOWARD ZOE TIMMS New York, Dec. 31, 2012 The writers are, respectively, president and founder/director of the Women's Education Project. To the Editor: My grandmother in India refused to let her daughters or daughters-in-law enter the kitchen or visit the temple during their menstrual periods because it was considered genuinely disrespectful and unhygienic. My wife and daughters today ignore the taboo of menstruation. While things are slowly changing, religious institutions among Hindus, Jains and Buddhists in America and India can take a proactive role in rejecting this taboo. Scholars and leaders at temples need to discuss the issue openly and encourage women to abandon the old practices and men to advocate on behalf of their mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. The taboo of menstruation has no correlation to disrespect or impure hygiene.

"42","In Mumbai, Privacy Is Hard to Come By","Asia","On Marine Drive, a popular seafront area in Mumbai, you will invariably find a few couples cuddling on the wall facing the sea, seemingly oblivious to the blazing afternoon sun and the endless stream of cars just behind them. In this city of cramped homes and crowded public spaces, these couples will take whatever time alone that they can get, even if it's in full view of others. This need for privacy has inspired a comprehensive study by Partners in Urban Knowledge, Action and Research (Pukar), an independent research collective based in Mumbai, which analyzed how the scarcity of space in the city has redefined the concept of privacy for the residents. Among its findings, Pukar reported that a majority of the female respondents did not find public spaces accessible to them because of safety, sexual harassment, public perceptions and family restrictions. The lack of open spaces in Mumbai has been the focus of much research and debate, even as the problem continues to worsen because of increasing development and a boom in construction. Earlier this year, a study carried out by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Environment Improvement Society found that Mumbai has just 11.6 square miles of open space, with about nine square feet available per person. ""In this era of urbanization, cities have become stronger engines of growth than ever before,"" said Anita Patil-Deshmukh, the executive director at Pukar. ""And that brings with it a whole host of problems. While certain problems are common to all global cities, the issue of privacy and public spaces is particularly relevant for Mumbai."" The Pukar study was commissioned as part of the BMW Guggenheim Lab, a traveling research team that deals with urban issues, which is based in the Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Mumbai until Jan. 20.  First conceptualized in December 2011, the study was conducted in and around greater Mumbai and includes 39 qualitative video and audio interviews, 800 surveys conducted in the homes of interviewees and in public spaces and photographic documentation. ""From our initial explorations in the city, the lab team thought it might be interesting to look into how people experienced private moments in Mumbai and how the meaning of privacy is different from the various places we all come from,"" said Aisha Dasgupta, one of the BMW Guggenheim Lab members in Mumbai. ""We found that not only did the versions of privacy vary greatly across cultures, but also within Mumbai, approaches to privacy vary according to economic background."" One of the biggest themes that emerged from the study was the lack of access to public spaces: 87 percent of the women felt that public spaces are inaccessible to them. 22 percent cited safety as their biggest concern, while 18 percent said that they were afraid of or sexual harassment. About 14 percent women said that they felt uncomfortable going to public spaces alone because of societal perception, while 11 percent cited family restrictions. ""That collectively 25 percent women felt that they could not access public spaces because of the societal or familial judgment shows the deep-seated entrenched patriarchy we are dealing with,"" said Ms. Patil-Deshmukh. ""Women still feel that if they go to a bar or a tea stall alone they will be considered loose women."" The study also revealed a rather surprising trend, as 53.5 percent of the respondents said that the place where they find time for themselves is home, followed by their workplace and their commute. Home was also the most popular place to meet partners or friends. ""In a city where the average size of the home is about 80 square feet, and the average size of the family is four people, this is rather shocking,"" said Ms. Patil-Deshmukh. However, she said that the respondents might have been inhibited in answering because their interviews were carried out in front of other family members. The study also revealed the changing patterns of relationships in a new India shaped by growing international exposure and Western influences. When asked with whom they would like to spend time, 36 percent of the respondents said friends, while 26 percent said they wanted time for themselves. About half of the respondents said that they needed privacy from their neighbors and family. ""Given that Indian culture is so deeply people-oriented, and family, friends, neighbors and relatives traditionally play such a large part in society, one has to wonder if more and more globalization is making the younger generation more self-centered,"" said Ms. Patil-Deshmukh. ""My sense is that this is more true for the younger generation than it was before."" The BMW Guggenheim Lab is working on a larger project covering 4,000 Mumbai residents. As part of the ongoing study, visitors to the lab at the Bhau Daji Lad Museum are also invited to participate in the survey. Though similar studies have not yet been carried for other cities, the BMW Guggenheim Lab hopes to extend this research globally. The lab will soon introduce an online survey dealing with issues of privacy and public space. ""It would interesting to see how the responses of people in very different cultural contexts compare,"" said Ms. Patil-Dasgupta. Researchers at Pukar said some simple solutions can help increase the amount of open space in Mumbai, like the adoption of public parks and open spaces by private companies that will be asked to maintain the space in return for visibility. The authors of the study also proposed that specific public spaces be carved out for senior citizens and young children. ""I would like to send this study to the city planners, but I'm not confident they will make use of it since they are struggling with so many other issues,"" Ms. Patil-Deshmukh said. ""A slum dweller I interviewed summed up the situation saying: 'If the government cannot give us a reasonable place to live in, what right do I have to ask for a public space like a park?'

"43","India's New Focus on Rape Shows Only the Surface of Women's Perils","Asia","NEW DELHI -- Harassed for years by her husband and his relatives, an Indian woman was finally kidnapped, raped, strangled and tossed into a ditch. For more than a year, the woman's father has tried without success to get the police to arrest those accused of killing her, including her husband, who were charged but remain at large. The father, Subedar Akhileshar Kumar Singh, an army officer, says he believes his daughter was killed because her in-laws were not satisfied with her dowry, according to an article on Thursday in The Indian Express. Such crimes are routine in this country, where researchers estimate that anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 women a year are killed over dowry disputes. Many are burned alive in a particularly grisly form of retribution. While a horrific gang rape in New Delhi has transfixed India and drawn attention to a violent epidemic, rape is just one facet of a broad range of violence and discrimination that leads to the deaths of almost two million women a year, researchers say. Among the causes are not only sexual violence but also domestic violence, family disputes and female infanticide, as well as infant neglect and poor care of the elderly that affect girls and women far more than boys and men. Women have made enormous strides in India in recent decades. Their schooling now matches that of men, and they have moved forcefully into many industries, although their participation in the work force is still far less than that of men. And women have become leaders in Indian politics. But women in New Delhi and throughout India say that their gender makes them vulnerable to attack from a vast and growing sea of unattached and unemployed young men who view women's success as the reason for their failure. ''Women are breaking through and advancing toward greater attainment -- but in a society that continues to be patriarchal, that is increasing tensions,'' said Dr. K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ''And one of the manifestations of that tension is increased violence against women.'' In a column in The Hindustan Times, Sagarika Ghose, an author and commentator, wrote, ''A profound fear and a deep, almost pathological, hatred of the woman who aspires to be anything more than mother and wife is justified on the grounds of tradition.'' That tradition has for centuries been especially deadly for women who fail to live up to its ideals or reject them altogether. Using techniques pioneered by Amartya Sen, an economist who won the Nobel Prize in 1998, researchers estimate that there are as many as 100 million ''missing women,'' as Mr. Sen called them, in India. These are women who would be alive if they died at the same rates relative to men as woman die relative to men in more developed countries, and their ranks grow by nearly two million each year, studies by an American and Canadian research team concluded. Some of these lives are ended before they begin: Indian women are far more likely to abort female fetuses than male ones. Still, such birth selection accounts for, at most, 12 percent of the figure, the researchers found. The official explanation for many of the deaths of ''missing women'' is that they died from accidents or injuries, but there is little reason to believe that Indians are especially clumsy or accident-prone, the researchers said. Instead, they believe that in many cases the official explanations mask deadly crimes. ''Our guess is that a lot of these deaths are due to the dowry phenomenon, but it just doesn't get reported that way,'' said Siwan Anderson, an associate professor of economics at the University of British Columbia and an author of the studies. As many as 100,000 women are burned to death each year and another 125,000 die from violent injuries that are rarely reported as killings, according to government figures and other data analyzed by the research team. Beyond violence, Indian girls may suffer from subtle neglect that can have profound consequences. Research has found, for instance, that Indian mothers tend to breast-feed boys longer than they do girls, Ms. Anderson said. And once their sons start eating solid food, they may get more of it than their daughters. Families may also invest more in the protection of boys' health, buying them mosquito netting to ward off malaria and dengue. These differences in nutrition and care may account for the substantially greater share of girls under the age of 4 who die of infectious and respiratory diseases in India than elsewhere, the researchers found. Deaths in childbirth, long considered a plague here, account for the fatalities of about 130,000 Indian women a year. An even greater number results from an increased relative risk of heart attacks, which may demonstrate that the poorer quality of care provided to women continues throughout their lives. As girls age, the strict controls that many families have over their daughters cannot protect them from rape and sexual assault, since most of those crimes are committed by people known to the women, studies say. But even so, such controls have some benefits, public health experts say. Indian women have, on average, no more than two sexual partners in their entire lives, and most are virgins when they marry, surveys show. This absence of promiscuity is probably an important reason that AIDS never became an epidemic in India. ''Tradition in this case is not a bad thing,'' said K. Sujatha Rao, a former health secretary of India and a crucial figure in the fight against AIDS. ''You take marriage here as a much more sacrosanct thing.'' Trying to determine how to protect women in India while preserving the country's traditions has led to a very public debate in recent weeks. Asaram Bapu, a popular Hindu guru, said that the New Delhi rape victim could have saved herself if she had simply ''held the hand of one of the men and said, 'I consider you as my brother.' '' Some conservative politicians and commentators blamed skirts, revealing clothing, a lack of overcoats on girls, junk food, astrology and the decisions by some wives to work outside the home. For many Indian women, having more police officers on the streets is no answer, since many view them as every bit as dangerous to their safety as criminals. On Thursday, the police in South Delhi put up posters advising young women to go straight home after their classes in school or college. Tradition in India also results in considerable acceptance of violence. A 2005 government survey found that 54 percent of women in India said that husbands were justified in beating their wives, with the most common justification being if they failed to show proper respect for their in-laws. Still, Indian husbands beat their wives far less than men in many other developing countries, according to comparable surveys done in multiple countries. Domestic violence levels are far higher in Colombia, Egypt, Peru and Zambia than in India, the surveys found. But discrimination against women is so endemic and wide-ranging in India that deaths from domestic violence account for only a fraction of the overall risk of unnecessary death. ''Other aspects come into play, like female infanticide, mistreatment of young girls in terms of access to resources, maternal deaths, unequal access to health care and so forth,'' said Ms. Anderson, the economics professor. ''Indian women face more dangers.''",2013,"India"
"44","Indonesian Women Told How to Ride Motorbikes","Asia","JAKARTA, Indonesia -- A plan by officials in an Indonesian city to ban women from straddling motorbikes has prompted an outcry from critics, who say local leaders are infringing on women's safety and freedom in the name of religion. Leaflets have been circulating for a week in Lhokseumawe, in Aceh Province on the island of Sumatra, informing residents about a proposed bylaw that would prohibit women from sitting in a straddle position or holding on to the driver while riding on the back of a motorbike. Most Indonesians are Muslims, but Aceh is the only province that seeks to strictly enforce Islamic law, or Shariah. The province already has bylaws prohibiting gambling and adultery and restricting how women may dress in public, with penalties that include public canings. The mayor of Lhokseumawe, Suaidi Yahya, proposed the straddling ban in a New Year's speech, saying that it was ''improper'' for women to sit with spread legs and that women should only sit sidesaddle, a practice that opponents say is both less comfortable and less safe. ''We want to save women from things that will cause them to violate Shariah law,'' Mr. Suaidi told The Jakarta Globe after his speech. ''We wish to honor women with this ban, because they are delicate creatures.'' Officials in the Indonesian Home Affairs Ministry, however, have called the proposal discriminatory. ''Laws need to be equal between men and women,'' said Zudan Arif Fakrulloh, head of the ministry's bureau of legal affairs. ''Not everything is equal in the culture in Aceh, but there should be equal rights for sitting in this way.'' Government agencies responsible for monitoring rights abuses also have criticized the proposal. ''It's discrimination, and it objectifies women,'' said Destika Gilang Lestari, a coordinator at the Aceh branch of the government's Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence. Local administrations have had the power to issue bylaws since 2001, but the national government can overturn them, as it has done thousands of times. Rights advocates say, though, that none of those cases involved Shariah law or sex discrimination. Advocates have called on women to ignore the proposed ban. ''We're encouraging citizens in Lhokseumawe not to heed this call, to teach the local government a lesson in drafting fairer laws,'' Affan Ramli, a spokesman for the Care for Shariah Civil Society Network, told the state news agency on Friday. Opponents say they are concerned in part because such a law, if enacted, could spread to other areas of the country. Since Aceh started imposing Islamic law in 2002, some other localities have also adopted bans on alcohol and on women appearing in public at night unaccompanied by a relative. In most of Indonesia there is little support for imposing Shariah law. Even in Aceh, many people say the laws are mainly symbolic and are unevenly enforced. Still, the authorities in Jakarta seldom speak out against the province's laws, partly out of fear of being seen as un-Islamic. Rights advocates say it is time they started. ''This bylaw is basically more about controlling morality than more rational considerations,'' said Andy Yentriyani, a member of the government's National Commission on Violence Against Women. ''If this continues, we will not be able to guarantee basic freedoms.''",2013,"Indonesia"
"45","Saying 'Yes' Matters as Much as 'No'","Asia","NEW DELHI -- The man who was my abuser was a fine host, a good husband, a caring father, a respected elder whose generosity and kindness were as genuine as the fact of the abuse. These qualities were important, because they helped him conceal the abuse he carried out over a period of four years. As a much-loved older relative, a close friend of my parents, he had unrestricted access to our house, and we visited him often. It was only at 12 that I began to feel uncomfortable. Not about the abuse -- I didn't know the term ''child sexual abuse'' at 9 or at 12, and had no words with which to describe my discomfort with the ''games'' he played -- but about the silence that he demanded. When I was 13, I left Delhi for Calcutta, to study in that city, and left my abuser behind. But he didn't forget, and when I came back to Delhi as a 17-year-old, he was there. At 17, I knew that he had no right to do this to me. When he sent poems, said that despite the four decades that separated us, we were supposed to ''be together,'' I finally broke my own silence -- but only partly. I told my mother and my sister, and they formed a fierce, protective barrier between me and my abuser. But the man who had started his abuse when I was a 9-year-old was still invited to my wedding, because we were keeping secrets, trying to protect one family member or another. Years later, when my abuser was dying of old age and diabetes, I visited him. There was no space for a long conversation, but I did tell him that I could not forget what he had done, even if forgiveness was possible. The silence around the abuse, as much as the abuse itself, festered and caused damage for years, until finally, in my thirties, the difficult but ultimately liberating process of healing began. In December 2012, a violent gang rape in Delhi took the life of a young woman and set off a raging debate over women's freedoms and rape laws. In all the complex arguments we've heard in the past few months in India on rape, violence against women and the even less often discussed experiences of men who have gone through either sexual violence or childhood sexual abuse, we have not discussed consent as much as we need to. In the area of rape, women's bodies in particular are often discussed as though they were property: How much freedom should the Indian family allow its daughters, wives, sisters, mothers? This way of thinking almost always reinforces curbs on women's freedoms, by heightening the idea that a woman's honor -- rather than her well-being -- must be safeguarded, because she is someone else's possession. This used to be, until very recently, underlined by most Indian government and legal documents, in which we were asked for the name of the father (not the mother), the husband (not the wife), as though the terms ''parent'' and ''partner'' were alien to the notion of the Indian family. If my story saddens you, please think about this: It is neither new nor rare, nor was the man who abused me a monster, or in any way out of the ordinary. According to a 2007 survey (the largest of its kind in India) conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Welfare, over 53 percent of Indian children have experienced some form of sexual abuse -- including a slightly higher percentage of boys than girls. I am only one of many. And I was luckier than most; my abuser was not excessively violent. As I learned to acknowledge the abuse and to cope with the fallout, I made some unexpected connections, found good friends, found strong mentors, found help, found my voice again and built a happier, more free life. I'm breaking my silence today to make a point, not about abuse, but about the importance of consent in the present debate over women's rights and gender equality in India. Survivors of childhood sexual abuse are no different from anyone who has survived sexual violence, in terms of what we do to rebuild ourselves. But we are experts in two areas: We've taken a master class in the toxicity of silence and secret-keeping, and we have doctorates in our understanding of the importance of consent. It can take abuse survivors, like rape survivors of either gender, years to reclaim a sense of ownership over their bodies. The body is the site of so many violations, starting with the chief one: Our abusers did not ask us for permission to use our bodies as they pleased. Over years, those of us who are fortunate enough to have access to well-trained counselors and healers learn to reclaim our bodies. We learn as adults what children are supposed to know by instinct: We learn that we can be safe in our bodies, we learn to play, to allow ourselves pleasure, to take care of ourselves, and most of all, we learn that we have the right to offer or withhold permission to other people, when they want access to our bodies, ourselves. The Indian family has most recently been invoked as an institution that needs to be safeguarded, by both the government and the judiciary. The Justice Verma Committee, including several eminent, retired members of the judiciary and legal experts, was set up in the aftermath of the December rape, to make recommendations on the rape laws. Rejecting the Verma Committee's strong appeal that marital rape be made an offense under the law, the Standing Committee on Home said that (a) the Indian family system would be disturbed; (b) there were practical difficulties; and (c) marriage presumes consent. These assumptions expose the violence and the toxicity at the heart of a certain view of the Indian family. For marriage to ''presume consent,'' you must assume that a woman gives up all rights to her body, to her very self, once she goes through the ceremony of marriage. You must also assume that a man is granted the automatic, legally sanctified right to access over his wife's body, regardless of whether she finds sex unwelcome, frightening, painful or violent or simply doesn't feel like it that particular night. This diminishes both genders, with its assumption that men are little more than lustful beasts, unable to restrain their libido, and the parallel assumption that women are passive receptacles without desires of their own, forced to submit to demands for sex regardless of what they want. This is a medieval view of marriage, and it is dismaying that Parliament appears to subscribe to it. What is missing in the Standing Committee's deliberations is the key question of consent -- the consent of the woman and, indeed, of any person in a sexual partnership or contract. To understand why this consent is important, we must first accept that all people -- children, women, men -- have a right to their own bodies, and that they cannot be forced to share their bodies with partners (or strangers) under any circumstances. They have the right to say no, as well as the right to say yes; to withhold or retreat, as well as to share their bodies freely and gladly. In any equal partnership, between any two people, whether in a marriage or not, the only possible basis for sex is the mutual understanding that consent is an active process -- to be offered freely, to be given freely, to be withdrawn just as freely. Underlying the principle of consent is the equally strong principle of respect -- respect for oneself as much as for one's partner. Without consent, there can be no gender equality; its absence makes every argument we have on rape, or on women's rights or children's rights, meaningless. On an active, day-to-day basis, consent embraces the idea that any woman or man is free to say yes or no to a sexual encounter, inside or outside marriage, regardless of whether he or she is, in the coarse phrase of the courts and police stations, ''habituated to sex.'' Survivors of child sexual abuse and rape survivors understand this instinctively: We understand that true respect for human beings includes giving them the right to say no, the right to choose when they will be touched, and by whom. If it is hard for Indian society to understand why everyone should have this right, then perhaps we should start with a very basic principle. Everyone has the right to live without his or her body being violated. Everyone has the right to demand that you ask for permission before you touch his or her body. Perhaps in time, Parliament and the government might understand this. The Justice Verma Committee and thousands of women trapped in marriages where they do not have the right to refuse sex certainly do understand. (For those who believe that marriage in India is a perfect, unsullied institution, read the statistics: Over 40 percent of women in marriages have reported domestic violence. That's reported, not experienced.) My own journey, from victim to survivor and then to a kind of normalcy, took years. Even so, I had less to deal with than some of those whose stories are reported in a recent study by Human Rights Watch of child sexual abuse in India -- no institutionalized abuse, no caste abuse, no extreme violence. In time, I became a writer, a listener and a collector of stories. From the shared stories of other survivors, I learned to let go of shame -- child abuse was too common and too widespread for that -- and I also learned that your memories, however dark, will not kill you, or prevent you from creating a better life. Reclamation happened slowly, sometimes painfully. I was lucky to have the support of my partner, close friends and great counselors. But it started with this simple thing: believing that I did have the right to say no, learning to claim my body and soul back again. The debate in India over rape laws, particularly marital rape, is about the simplest thing of all: acknowledging that women (and men, and children) have a right over their own bodies. This should not be treated, as it is now, as a dangerous or radical idea; in a country that thinks of itself as modern, it's time we embraced the idea of consent, in marriage and in all relationships. Even though it's so common -- more than half of all adults in my generation of Indians have experienced some form of child sexual abuse -- few survivors discuss their experiences, because of the Indian family's insistence on silence. That silence transferred the shame of the abuser's act onto the child and onto the family; it is powerful and crippling, and it actively enables abuse. The silence around marital rape is strengthened when the Indian social and legal system refuses even to acknowledge that it exists; for an abuser, and for a rapist, these silences are enabling. Just as children have the right to ask that their bodies remain unviolated by the people they should be able to trust, a woman has the right to say no, she does not give her consent. Even, and perhaps especially, in a relationship as intimate as marriage. This essay by Nilanjana S.

"46","India's Man Problem","Asia","As India grapples with what seems like a constant barrage of shocking acts of violence against women, one question is asked again and again: Why is this happening? One answer, some experts say, is India's gender ratio, distorted by the practice of sex selection in favor of baby boys. A much-cited 2002 study,""A Surplus of Men, a Deficit of Peace,"" by Valerie M. Hudson and Andrea den Boer, contends that a gender imbalance in Asian countries, caused by a shortage of marriageable women, results in higher rates of crime, including rape, committed by young unmarried men. ""Internal instability is heightened in nations displaying exaggerated gender inequality, leading to an altered security calculus for the state,"" the authors wrote in 2002, and reiterated in a book on the subject. Their conclusions are even more true today, Ms. Hudson said in an e-mail interview. ""Certainly the situation is, if anything, worse in both India and China than it was 10 years ago,"" she wrote. ""Certainly violent crime against women increases as the deficit of women increases. This will constrain the life chances of females far into the future."" Right now, the statistics are worrying. India has 37 million more men than women, as of 2011 census data, and about 17 million excess men in the age group that commits most crimes, up from 7 million in 1991. Violent crime in India rose nearly 19 percent from 2007 to 2011, while the kidnapping of women (much of which is related to forced marriage) increased 74 percent in that time. That's a marked increase from the five years before 2007, when violent crime actually fell by 2.8 percent, and the kidnapping of women rose by 41 percent. If the study's conclusions are correct, India's problems with rape and other forms of violence against women - recently seen in the gang rape and subsequent death of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi, the gang rape of a high school student in Bihar state and the rape of a young woman in Punjab, who committed suicide afterward- may only get worse, given the trend in India's demographics. The authors adopted a Chinese term, guang gun-er (""bare branches""), for unmarried men from age 15 to their mid-30s who have limited prospects for employment. This group, which is larger in countries where sex selection is prevalent, usually ""commits the preponderance of violence within a society,"" according to the report. In a marriage market where women are scarce and thus able to ""marry up,"" certain characteristics of young surplus males are easily and accurately predicted. They are liable to come from the lowest socioeconomic class, be un- or underemployed, live a fairly nomadic or transient lifestyle with few ties to the communities in which they are working, and generally live and socialize with other bachelors. In sum, these young surplus males may be considered, relatively speaking, losers in societal competition. Marital status affects more than just social standing for these men, the authors argued. Citing research indicating that levels of testosterone (referred to as ""T"" in the following quote) decline for married men, they said that marriage can thwart potentially antisocial male behavior. When T falls, so does the propensity to engage in these behaviors. The more men in the society who are unable to marry, even though they would be willing to marry, the higher their circulating T and the greater amount of antisocial, violent and criminal behavior they will exhibit, generally speaking, than if they were able to marry. A study on the sexuality of ""bare branches"" in China this year elaborated on the issues that arise with these carnally charged young men. The report said a ""series of problems from sexual repression to sexual conflicts, from sexually transmitted diseases (including AIDS) to sexual crimes can arise."" Intermingling and aggregation are key to understanding ""bare branches,"" according to Ms. Hudson and Ms. den Boer's study. These men hang out together, befriend each other, compete with each other and legitimize each others' ""risky choices."" When clumped together and left to their own devices, they become a tool of social disorder, the authors said: In this ""least common denominator"" theory, the behavior of men in groups - most particularly young, single, low-status males - will not rise above the behavior of the worst-behaved individual. Together, they will take larger risks and be more violent than they otherwise would individually. The sheer number of bare branches, coupled with the distinctive outcast subculture that binds them together and their lack of ""stake"" in the existing social order, predispose them to organized social banditry. The potential for intrasocietal violence is increased when society selects for bare branches, as certain Asian societies do. It is possible that this intrasocietal violence may have intersocietal consequences as well. According to the 2011 crime statistics in India, of all the people arrested for rape crimes, almost 60 percent were men between the ages of 18 to 30 years and nearly 30 percent were men between the ages of 30 to 45 years. India's total sex ratio -- defined as the number of females per 1,000 males -- has increased over the past 20 years, after dropping for the 80 years before that. As of 2011, there were 940 Indian women for every 1,000 men, up from 933 in 2001. But, thanks to population growth and a still-prevalent practice of female foeticide, the number of ""extra men"" is growing among India's youth. There will be about 30 million extra men in India between the age of 15 and 35, the study estimates. And among India's youngest population, the gender ratio is still getting worse, perhaps setting the foundation for new generations of violent crime and attacks on women, experts say. India's child population, defined in the national census data as all children between the ages of zero and 6 years, was almost 160 million as of 2011. The overall sex ratio for this age group is 914 female children for every 1,000 male children, and it is even more skewed in the urban parts, at 902. These figures mark a severe decline from a decade ago. Overall, the Indian average gender ratio is far behind the global average of 984 for every 1,000 men, and is the second lowest in the world, before China. Urban India is on par with China though, with 926 women per 1,000 men. India's Planning Commission, in a report on women's rights and child rights released last year, called the gender imbalance in the sex ratio ""a silent demographic disaster in the making."" The report said that the heavily patriarchal areas in the north and northwest have shown a mild improvement in the gender ratio for children, but that most of India has seen it decline. The number of female children relative to male children is expected to remain very low, according to the report. The Indian government has tried to mend this deteriorating ratio through cash incentive programs that began in 2007. The idea, officials said, was to ""force the families to look upon the girl as an asset rather than a liability since her very existence has led to cash inflow to the family."" However, a recent evaluation of these various programs shows that they have way too many muddled conditions and imprecise focus groups. ""I think it is true that unless the government is willing to enforce its own laws against dowry and sex-selective abortion, not much will change,""  Professor Hudson said.",2013,"India"
"47","Why Do Men Dominate Chinese Politics? Because They're 'Just Too Superb'","Asia","Li Yalan, a delegate to the National People's Congress, looked flustered by a question from a foreign journalist at a news conference for female delegates that had, until then, focused on family values, children, the need for better statistics about women and the economic value of women's handicrafts. ""Why are there still so few women at the top of Chinese politics and state-owned companies?"" despite a 65-year-old policy of gender equality, the journalist asked. ""Our male leaders are just too superb!"" responded Ms. Li, who is also a lawyer from the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. ""I hope we women can be as wonderful as they are."" The accolade for Chinese male leadership came Wednesday afternoon, the penultimate day of the annual meeting of the rubber-stamp legislature. Chinese feminists and foreign journalists have written that there has never been a woman on the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, that there is only one female provincial Communist Party secretary and one female provincial governor, and how the number of women in the party's Central Committee has actually fallen, from 6.4 percent in the last session, which began in 2007, to 4.9 percent in the present session, which began in 2012. Stung, perhaps, Chinese officials have pointed out that there are more female delegates at this session of the National People's Congress, which began in 2013, than at the previous one, which began in 2008: 23.4 percent compared with 21.4 percent. Despite that, the delegates selected to represent Chinese women at the news conference Wednesday addressed issues that feminists around the world might find secondary to political and economic challenges: Women's role in the cultivation of virtues in children. Strengthening family traditions. There were other topics. Lin Yinmao, deputy secretary-general of the standing committee of the Shanghai People's Congress, described a proposal she filed at the congress asking that the National Bureau of Statistics compile statistics by gender, to give a more accurate picture of women's employment status. ""We need to compare female and male unemployment figures in order to really determine the problem,"" Ms. Lin said. ""We want to be a country ruled by law, so we have to systematize the gathering of gendered statistics and get that into the statistics law. My concrete proposal is for all levels of government to be required to do this."" There was agreement that female university graduates must not be shut out of the job market, where many say they suffer discrimination. Xu Xiao, a member of the board at Kaifeng Luocheng Development, a company in Henan Province, said: ""We mustn't discriminate against women just because they are going to have families and children."" Yet there was also much talk of virtue, of women's primary duty to society - caring for the family - and handicrafts. Luo Ning, the chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation in Guizhou, an autonomous region in China's southwest, had brought along an embroidered bag made by local women and stood up to show it the room. ""This was embroidered by women,"" she said. ""It's a handcrafted bag with added industrial elements. It's a very stylish bag, a bag you could carry to the Great Hall of the People."" She was displaying the achievements of the Miao people and other ethnic minority women in Guizhou, whose traditional crafts the women's federation is trying to promote to help the region's economy. Ms. Xu spoke emotionally about her mother's sacrifices. ""She got up every morning before dawn to make everyone's meals"" and ""worked at unending household tasks,"" she said. ""We need more of the morals and values"" that she learned from her mother, said Ms. Xu, such as: ""If you borrow something, give it back early. Be good! Our parents told us."" Not satisfied with the response to her question about why there are so few women in leadership positions in China, the foreign journalist pressed the issue. This time, Zhang Hui, the deputy party secretary and mayor of Weihai, in the eastern province of Shandong, answered, ""To be honest, that question speaks to all our female cadres' hopes."" It is very hard for a woman to rise, Ms. Zhang said. ""In any country there is a pyramid, with many people at the bottom and the numbers contracting as you rise. For men the pyramid is fatter in the middle, but for women, perhaps the higher you rise, the harder it is to rise,"" she said, using her hands to show two shapes - a generous, inverted ""U"" for men, and a tighter, inverted ""T"" for women. ""That's the case in every country, not just in China."" Still, it is state policy to increase the number of women in politics, Ms. Zhang said. Ms. Lin, from Shanghai, offered some concrete figures: Shanghai's local congress is now 31.7 percent women. Ms. Li, from Heilongjiang, said six of the 16 members of her province's delegation to the National People's Congress were women. Ms. Zhang seemed to feel one impediment to women's progress was their quality. ""I am confident that when our quality, when we Chinese women have a bunch of really excellent-quality females, then the number of women in the top levels of government will rise,"" she said. As the event was breaking up, a male journalist at a Chinese state-run magazine who did not want his name used, commented privately: ""It is true that Mao Zedong said that 'Women hold up half the sky.' But,"" the journalist added, citing the ancient philosopher whose paternalistic teachings underlie so much Chinese tradition, ""there's also Confucius."" Trying to do it all - meeting expectations of traditional behavior while fighting for a place on the narrow pyramid of advancement, may be wearing Chinese women out, Ms. Zhang intimated. ""We are very tired,"" she said. ""But we are gaining recognition in society.""",2014,"China"
"48","Bangladesh's Home Truth","Asia","DHAKA, Bangladesh -- It's fine to call yourself a feminist in Bangladesh. In fact, it's even encouraged. The title, earned through the work of a generation of women who heralded the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 with promises of a transformed nation, has not yet accrued the complicated history that makes it an uncomfortable label for women in the West. In London, I hear the word whispered, hedged with caveats and reservations; in Dhaka, it is shouted and sung in public forums as a riposte to the cacophonous voices of religious fundamentalism and ingrained patriarchy. Bangladesh has made extraordinary progress in the past 43 years. By the end of the 1990s, Bangladesh had closed the gender gap in primary education, and it is now one of the few countries in the world where the number of girls in high school is greater than the number of boys. Low-cost health-care initiatives have been responsible for a significant improvement in maternal and infant mortality rates, with the maternal mortality ratio (that is, maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) reduced to 240 today from 800 in 1990. Finally, women have entered the work force in great numbers, largely because of the growth of the garment industry -- now estimated to be worth $20 billion a year. Although the industry needs to address the working conditions that led to the death of 1,129 workers in the collapse of the Rana Plaza complex last year, the fact that over three million women are in formal, paid employment in this sector alone has had a significant social impact. This past January, at a public lecture in Mumbai, India, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen praised Bangladesh's record on gender equality, stating that Bangladesh had surpassed India's record ''in every aspect of the human development index'' because of its investment in women's health and education. While Professor Sen is correct to praise Bangladesh -- and we always enjoy outdoing our powerful neighbor -- the larger issue of how near women have approached real equality is still debatable: One great obstacle stands in their way. At the time of its drafting in 1972, Bangladesh's Constitution was considered a remarkably progressive document. It enshrined equal rights for all citizens; it guaranteed religious freedom; it made secularism a pillar of the new nation. The Constitution's guiding spirit reflected a prevailing desire to create a new -- and better -- social contract than the one left behind when the country won independence from Pakistan. The Constitution, however, has created a barrier to women's advancement. Article 28 states that ''Women shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the State and of public life,'' but elsewhere it acknowledges Islam as the state religion and effectively enshrines the application of Islamic law in family affairs. The Constitution thus does nothing to enforce equality in private life. Marriage, divorce, inheritance and child custody are all still determined by Shariah law, which was established by legislation dating from 1937 (and amended in 1957 under Ayub Khan, president of Pakistan, which then included the territory that later became Bangladesh). Under the Muslim Personal Law, a woman is legally entitled to inherit only half of a brother's share on the death of their parents. Whether they are pious or not, in matters of property men become sticklers for religion. The same goes for divorce settlements. Contemplating the end of a long marriage, a friend of mine must now wait patiently while her husband decides what financial settlement he will give her. In her case, she trusts that the arrangement will be dictated by his sense of fairness, but if it is unacceptable, she has little legal recourse. This contradiction in the Constitution -- guaranteeing equal rights to all citizens while allowing women's lives to be circumscribed by Shariah law -- is a block to social progress. Bangladesh has ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women -- sometimes called the United Nations bill of rights for women -- but has done so only with certain reservations, all stemming from the Constitution's admission of Shariah law. The conflict between women's formal rights in the public sphere and their deprivation of rights in the private one is not just an issue of assets, property and child custody; it also has a strong bearing on women's security within the home. When there is an accepted principle that family life is exempt from the standards of public life, women suffer behind closed doors. A recent survey of over 12,000 women, conducted by the United Nations Population Fund, in partnership with the Bangladeshi government, revealed that 87 percent of women interviewed had suffered domestic violence, while one-third had experienced marital rape. Since 2010, Bangladesh has had a Domestic Violence Act, but it goes largely unenforced; there have been almost no convictions. A constitutional amendment alone won't be a panacea. The basic assumptions that men and women make about their respective places in society need shifting. A new initiative, introduced this week by President Abdul Hamid, aims to do just that. (My mother, Shaheen Anam, herself a feminist activist, has been involved.) Called ''Equality Through Dignity,'' the campaign will highlight the contribution of women to society in general. It starts with a publicity push in which famous men -- national celebrities, government ministers, members of Parliament and the president himself -- hold up placards saying: ''I am sorry. Let's change.'' Apologies are all very well, but the show of contrition would mean more if it were accompanied by the amendment of Bangladesh's founding document. In the meantime, we feminists will continue to shout proudly from the rooftops -- demanding that promised change.

"49","Social Gains for Women Linked to Domestic Violence","Asia","NEW DELHI - Indian women who experience economic and social gains in the form of employment and education are often at a greater risk for domestic violence, according to a study released on Tuesday. The study, published in the peer-reviewed Population and Development Review, analyzed responses from more than 60,000 married women in the National Family Health Survey of India conducted from 2005 to 2006 in 29 states. Abigail Weitzman, a doctoral candidate in sociology at New York University, wrote in her study that compared with women who do not work, women who are the only employed members of their households face more than twice the risk of frequent domestic violence and 1.51 times the risk of severe domestic violence, which includes beating, choking, burning or attack with a weapon. Women with more education than their husbands had 1.4 times the risk of domestic violence and 1.54 times the risk of frequent violence compared with women with less education than their husbands. ""For lots of families, money is a source of power, at least implicitly,"" Ms. Weitzman said in a telephone interview.  ""If you're starting to change the balance of power, it changes the equation."" The idea of empowering women through development programs is almost as old as the idea of developmental aid itself.  The United Nations Development Program considers women's empowerment as one of eight millennium development goals. In India, the idea of women's empowerment has received more public attention since the gang rape of a woman on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012 received widespread international attention. Ms. Weitzman, whose findings are echoed in similarstudies in India released recently, said that attempts to empower women through government programs like microfinancing were far more complicated than they seem. ""Scientific evidence of the unintended consequences suggests that programs that are designed to empower women are much more complicated than simply providing women with resources to achieve complete autonomy,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""Change is often very turbulent,"" she said.  ""I think that's perhaps what India is witnessing right now, and I don't think India is alone in experiencing this turbulence.""",2014,"India"
"50","South Korea's Sexist Military","Asia","BUSAN, South Korea -- The Korea Air Force Academy recently decided that it would grant its highest academic award for graduating seniors, the presidential prize, not to the valedictorian but to the salutatorian. Traditionally the prize is given to the student with the highest grade-point average, but the administrators said they chose the runner-up this year because he had performed better than the valedictorian in nonacademic areas like physical fitness and leadership, and in military studies. But to many South Koreans, the real reason for the choice was obvious: The valedictorian was a woman and the salutatorian a man. South Korea first allowed women into the military in 1950 during the Korean War. Back then, female soldiers mainly held administrative and support positions. Women began to take on combat roles in the 1990s when the three military academies, exclusive to men, began accepting women. In 2013, female soldiers numbered more than 8,200 in a total military force of 639,000 soldiers. Women now serve in nearly every branch of the military (they are banned from select marine and commando units because of the strength requirements) and their enrollment has climbed steadily. But as the number of women in the military has grown, discrimination against them has not eased. An investigation by the National Human Rights Commission, released in November 2013, found that close to 12 percent of women in the military experienced sexual harassment, and that 71 percent of female soldiers were aware that their superiors preferred male subordinates to female. Thirty-four percent of the women who experienced sexual harassment said that, since they did not believe the military would ever change, they would just endure the discrimination. The problems faced by female soldiers are mirrored in the military academies. While these institutions have not completely ignored the issue of mistreatment of women, their approach has been misguided. Last May, after a second-year female student was raped by a fourth-year male student, the Korea Military Academy announced stricter enforcement of its ''three prohibitions'' -- on marriage, smoking and drinking. (It also took disciplinary action against the participants.) Shortly after, the navy and army announced similar measures. In June, the Naval Academy published a ''Female Students' Guidebook for Relations with the Opposite Gender.'' Women were strongly advised to apply only basic makeup, use neutral-colored nail polish and wear subtle shades of lipstick. Strongly scented perfumes were banned and undergarments should ''not sully the student's dignity,'' the pamphlet added. While a ban on smoking and drinking may make sense in a military academy, the logic of forbidding marriage is confusing. Married cadets are much less likely to cause trouble, and the ban shows just how far out of touch the administrators are. But the Naval Academy's booklet for women is patently offensive: It suggests that women who are sexually assaulted have only themselves to blame. From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s -- the era of military dictatorship when South Korea was rebuilding itself from a postwar economic basket case to a humming, modern nation -- military schools were the track of choice for ambitious young men. Bright, talented boys without enough money for private school tuition competed for the free education, housing and living stipend offered by the academies -- and the status that came with enrollment. President Park Chung-hee, who held office from 1963-79, and the two presidents after him graduated from the Korea Military Academy. The military suddenly lost its stature when the dictatorship ended in 1987. Today, being in the army means living on a modest salary in one of South Korea's coldest regions near the demilitarized zone. Military men have trouble finding wives: Many young women, accustomed to a comfortable urban lifestyle (or, at least, aspiring to one), have little regard for professional soldiers. And the constant movement of a military life can be tough on children. My father was an officer in the army, and I was forced to change elementary schools six times. Yet the military academies are very popular with women. As South Korea's economic growth has slowed, full-time jobs have become scarce, especially for women. In contrast to the rate of male labor participation (the labor force as a percentage of the whole population) of 73.3 percent, the rate for women is 49.9 percent. Even young women who find good jobs can have their careers sidelined by maternity leave and child care. But the military comes with attractive benefits, especially for women, who are rarely derailed from advancement when they have babies. The 2010 census showed that women in the military have a fertility rate of 1.61 children, compared with a national rate of 1.15 children per woman. A military career offers the stability many South Korean women crave. On Feb. 25, the first anniversary of her administration, President Park Geun-hye announced, ''If the key is to utilize the female work force in order to maintain economic growth, we have to ensure that talented women do not have to endure a disruption to their careers.'' The military is a testing ground for the commander in chief's promises. If the military, the country's most male-centric and conservative organization, cleans up its sexual discrimination practices and provides equal opportunity regardless of gender, the effect on society at large will be enormous. In the end, the Air Force Academy reviewed its original decision over the presidential award and gave it to the female valedictorian. That was a welcome step in the right direction, but much more has to change. South Korea's women are waiting. Young-ha Kim is a novelist and short-story writer.

"51","CLINTON IN CHINA: THE FIRST LADY; Hillary Clinton Discovers How Chinese Women Fare","Asia","Hillary Rodham Clinton met today with some of the best and brightest of Beijing's vibrant women's movement, discussing a wide range of sometimes sensitive issues from domestic violence to unemployment to China's high rates of female suicide. Mrs. Clinton mostly sat back and listened as the panel of seven Chinese women told of the multitude of problems women in this country still face and of their work to solve them. Although many of the panelists have long been outspoken on women's issues in front of small groups, such frank discussion in a public international forum was unusual. And the light atmosphere was in marked contrast to the tension surrounding the International Women's Conference that Mrs. Clinton attended in Beijing in 1995. The panelists included Xie Lihua, a journalist who has championed the cause of China's rural women, and Liu Bohong of the official All-China Women's Federation, who displayed the newly published Chinese translation of the American women's medical work ""Our Bodies, Ourselves"" (Touchstone, 1996). At the end, a clearly appreciative Mrs. Clinton said, ""I don't think I've ever been in a more lively, energetic, and informed discussion than this one today."" The panelists described the many projects under way to improve the status of women, but their remarks were filled with reminders that deep-rooted cultural discrimination persists, particularly in the countryside.  Ms. Xie likes to remind people that if you knock at a door in rural China, women are likely to answer, ""Nobody's home,"" if there are no men inside. Three years ago, she founded the magazine Rural Women Knowing All to give women in the countryside a voice. At today's forum, she described how the magazine had published self-help articles on reproductive health, set up programs for women who are migrant workers in Beijing and helped organize small loans for women to start cottage industries. But she and other panelists described with bittersweet smiles the biases that such women's programs must overcome. Ge Youli of the United Nation's Development Program in Beijing told of organizing meetings in the countryside to explain loan programs for women and having only husbands turn up. ""We say 'Where are your wives?',"" Ms. Ge said. ""They say, 'At home cooking, of course'."" She described how the men are then instructed to play a game of what Americans call ""Telephone,"" where the first is given a message which is passed down a line of 10. By the end, she said, the message had changed. ""That's why your wives should be here,"" she told them. But the panelists also told of poor rural women who with the help of such loans had escaped dreary lives by setting up prosperous businesses, like tofu shops and pig farms, and of how the traditional notion that ""only men are important"" was changing. Another panelist, Chen Mingxia, who is a lawyer at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, described work in educating women about their legal rights. Although China has a fairly comprehensive women's rights law on paper, discrimination against women is common in areas like hiring and allocating housing. At Beijing's prestigious universities there is a saying to describe the hiring hierarchy on graduation: first men with a Beijing residency permit, then men without a Beijing residency permit, only then the women. Ms. Chen described how a rural legal aid center helped a woman who wanted to divorce her abusive husband but had neither the money nor the know-how to proceed. The panelists excitedly described a wide range of ambitious projects to improve the status of women, from Zheng Bichuan efforts to improve the high drop-out rate among rural girls to Liu Bohong's research on images of women in the media. Some are conducted under the auspices of the Chinese Government and others receive financing from foreign organizations, like the Ford Foundation. Perhaps most revealing about how far the discussion has come since 1995 was the moment when Ms. Liu produced the bright red-covered ""American Our Bodies, Ourselves,"" a translation project that at times had been stalled by political debates about what could and could not be said in China. No matter that the final product was missing the American edition's sections on lesbianism and masturbation or that a number of pictures were not reproduced. At last, the book was out.",1998,"China"
"52","A HALF-CENTURY IN CHINA: THE FEMINIST; TV Producer Is From New Breed of Woman","Asia","Zhao Shujing became a feminist only in 1994, after she read ""The Second Sex"" by Simone de Beauvoir, then recently translated into Chinese. Today, she is the executive producer of China's most influential women's show, ""Half the Sky,"" which broadcasts three times a week on state television. Outspoken and independent, Ms. Zhao represents a new breed of Chinese woman, pursuing careers at an age when, earlier in this century, they might already be approaching grandmotherhood. And, she says she belongs to a new brand of Chinese woman's movement -- one initiated by women themselves rather than being prescribed by the state. ""In the last decade, women's consciousness has been stronger than at any time in the last 100 years,"" she said recently at a Beijing teahouse, wearing a trendy black pants outfit and lugging a distressed leather bag. Her show's name is a nod to Mao's line ""Women hold up half the sky"" -- his statement of female empowerment. But, Ms. Zhao says, reality did not always live up to that ideal in the early years of Communist rule. ""In the past, the women's movement was developed by men -- it was not their own, it was Mao's,"" she said. The few women in power were mostly wives of important officials and had little independent claim to high status. For Ms. Zhao's generation that has largely changed, as women's advocates -- often still with some connection to the Government, through jobs at state-run news media and universities -- are increasingly vocal and speaking their mind. These women, like Ms. Zhao, are taking on both society and officialdom on topics like discrimination in housing and jobs. They are encouraging open debate on issues not normally mentioned in China, like the relationship between conservative mothers and their more liberal daughters regarding dating and sex. Ms. Zhao said she never thought about feminist concerns as a girl in Beijing, having absorbed her society's biases. ""I thought the difference was just biological and that being a woman was a lot of trouble,"" she says with a laugh. She said the publicity leading up to the 1995 International Conference on Women, which was held in Beijing, impelled her, and many others, to rethink their ideas. It was then that she switched from general programming to the women's show. For example, in the early 1990's her television station -- like most state institutions -- would not allocate apartments to single women, who were forced to live in dormitories. Shortly after the women's conference, senior women at the station protested to Government officials and, at age 35, she got an apartment for herself. ""In general, I think things are getting better,"" she said. ""But there is still lots to be done."" On her show, she has run segments on the discrimination facing women just entering the job market from college, on domestic abuse and the educational problems of rural girls. She says Chinese women over 40 carry a particular burden, since they often have little schooling and are dismissed by society as over the hill. Still, at 37, she feels herself confidently unbound by such notions. ""I don't fear the threshold,"" she said. ""Women of my generation, especially educated women, care much more about capabilities."" She is traveling a new route, increasingly common among professional women today: She is now married, but plans not to have children. ""Many people in my circle don't want children -- it's too much trouble,"" she said. ""The world has 6 billion people and so many orphans. Is it necessary for me to give birth to be a woman?""   http://www.nytimes.com",1999,"China"

"55","Rights Gains Are Preserved At U.N. Forum On Women","Asia","Five years after a watershed conference held in Beijing articulated and affirmed what more than 180 nations could agree were the universal rights of women, a weeklong follow-up meeting ended yesterday at the United Nations with no significant victories for opponents who have tried to reverse those gains. An all-night session Friday into yesterday, capping a week of heated arguments, preserved a range of women's rights including the most contentious, that ""women have the right to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality"" and can do so without ""coercion, discrimination and violence."" Around the world, this can mean something as basic as choosing a spouse or avoiding genital mutilation in the name of tradition. ""I'm very happy that the dire predictions that there would be a rollback have proved false,"" said Angela King, the United Nations official in charge of women's advancement. ""We were determined to get a strong document that did not in any way diminish the gains women had achieved in Beijing,"" she said. ""We were also determined to go beyond Beijing, and we did, despite the efforts of countries that made the process such an arduous one."" Although some Western and international women's groups failed to expand definitions in the Beijing document to include more explicit homosexual rights, broad definitions of ""family"" and more clearly stated support for safe and readily available abortions, other issues did make advances. Delegations from 180 nations, urged on from the sidelines by representatives of about 1,200 nongovernmental organizations, took strong stands on the trafficking of women and girls, who are sold or lured across borders by the sex trade or for domestic or industrial work that often amounts to wage slavery. Delegates also agreed on strong planks that call for punishment of domestic violence, including marital rape, which some delegations had argued was essentially a private matter not recognized as a crime in many nations. There were also calls to outlaw the killings of women whose families claim have shamed them, so-called ""honor"" crimes that have drawn attention to countries like Jordan and Pakistan. United Nations officials and women's rights campaigners say that this is the first time an international document has specified these activities as crimes. Although the final agreement of the conference does not have the force of law, it can be used by women as a statement of international norms when trying to change the laws of nations. The meeting's final declaration also demanded more attention to the H.I.V.-AIDS epidemic, which in the five years since the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing has begun to victimize many more women, especially in Africa. There, women's organizations say, the sexual rights of women are a matter of life and death, when traditions within extended families or clans may force girls and women into sexual arrangements they cannot avoid with men whom they may know to be infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. As is almost inevitably the case when sensitive social issues are exposed to international debate, battle lines were drawn between conservative countries, largely Islamic or Roman Catholic, and more secular nations, though there was no fixed geographical pattern. Poland and Nicaragua, for example, have often been reticent on certain women's rights, while Europe and Latin America in general take a much more liberal stand, even on contraception and abortion. Among Islamic nations, delegates said, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Pakistan and Sudan were most reluctant to advance women's rights. The opposition lobby got strong support from the Vatican, which attends such conferences based on its territorial possessions in Rome. Among the organizations that expressed disappointment yesterday were the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University, and the Women's Environment and Development Organization in New York. They issued a statement regretting the failure to agree to a stronger document. Anna Diamantopoulou, a Greek politician who is now the European Union's commissioner for employment and social affairs, was not concerned that the conference did not push too hard on the limits of what the majority of national governments or societies could accept. She warned of the danger of provoking a backlash against women's groups in many countries if they returned with a declaration that could be interpreted as a call to upset the social order. ""When they go home, they want to be waving the document, not apologizing for it,"" she said.  http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"China"
"56","Measuring the Progress of Women","Asia","Next week at the United Nations, representatives of nearly every country and thousands of non-governmental groups are meeting to talk about what the world has done to improve the lives of women. The delegates will evaluate what has happened since the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, when 187 nations endorsed a wide range of goals and promised specific actions. The subject of women's needs is, of course, a broad one, encompassing poverty -- 70 percent of the poor are female -- health, domestic violence, armed conflict, political representation and other issues. One achievement of the Beijing conference was its acknowledgment that women need to be heard in debates on just about every kind of policy. The Beijing conference was the fourth U.N. conference on women, but more than the others it established concrete targets -- such as abolishing laws that discriminate against women economically or increasing the number of women in public administration -- and set timetables for measuring progress. Activists have found these benchmarks crucial to holding governments accountable. In 1998 the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a New York-based network of groups, did a survey of progress. It found that most of the governments represented at Beijing had drawn up plans to keep their promises, and 64 countries had changed laws. The growth of local women's groups has been the most important reason for these advances. Some 30,000 activists attended the Beijing conference, and they have used its platform to organize women and to press governments to keep their commitments. But most of what governments call action is still just lofty talk, and is not yet affecting women. The inaction stems partly from cultural resistance and partly from lack of money to finance new programs.  Governments argue, persuasively, that they are overwhelmed by AIDS, debt payments and budget cuts demanded by the International Monetary Fund. But women's issues have never been a priority, even when progress, as with educating girls, would benefit the nation as a whole. In addition, many governments are not even changing egregious laws, which costs nothing. In several countries women may not inherit property. In much of Latin America, a rapist goes free if he marries the victim. In several Islamic countries, a man may kill a female relative who has disgraced the family. In Pakistan, women's testimony has no value in rape cases. In Kuwait, women still may not vote. ""We have prepared people to ask their government: 'Did you do what you said you would do?' "" says Litha Musyimi-Ogana, a Kenyan activist, who could be speaking for women's groups everywhere.  This is a big achievement, but the answer in too many places is ""no."" http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"China"
"57","Brutality Cloaked as Tradition","Asia","How could a tribal council in the Pakistani village of Meerwala Jatoi decree that a young woman be raped in revenge for a crime allegedly committed by her brother? They were certain they could get away with it, of course. And they would have, except that the local imam spoke out against it during Friday prayers; a journalist in the mosque that day reported the case; the story was picked up nationwide, then worldwide. Absent this circumstantial chain, the rape would have gone unremarked. That was and is the norm for rape -- except that no tribal council (known as a panchayat or, in regions bordering Afghanistan, as a jirga) is known to have pronounced such a sentence before. Government officials routinely turn a blind eye to panchayat or jirga justice, which mostly settles matters related to land or family disputes. Police chiefs and district commissioners attempting to end jirga law find no support from the government. The strengthening of jirga law beyond Pakistan's tribal areas (where it has some legal sanction) has run parallel with the rise of Islamic extremism. Many Pakistanis connect the two as being ""traditional"" and therefore similar, but the fact remains that the jirga tradition has no connection to religion, and that many so-called traditions, particularly ""Islamic laws,"" are not based in religion or tradition. Jirga law is rooted in tribal customs and in the power of tribal elders. The state, willing to exchange some of its powers for social stability, has let these men take responsibility for many ""private"" matters. This often means, in practice, giving this small portion of the population private power over others, particularly women, even at a time when elsewhere in society, the power of the elders is declining. What is equally troubling is that the state, in its insecurity, might even cede more power by redefining public affairs as private, thereby shifting accountability away from itself and into the hands of others. This has happened not only with jirga law -- giving both accountability and power to tribal elders -- but on a larger scale with Islamic law and practice. For example, the panchayat's decree in Meerwala Jatoi that the punishment of rape be carried out by four men echoes the aberrations in Pakistani law introduced by Gen. Zia ul-Haq, whose military rule lasted from 1977 to 1988, in his attempts to Islamicize the country. One law introduced in 1979 requires the presence of four witnesses to an act of rape or adultery before the crime can be established. This law obliterates the distinction between adultery and rape, criminalizing a private offense (adultery) while, in effect, making rape a private matter in which the burden of proof lies on the victim. Yet even General Zia's campaign to create new laws and punishments and label them as Islamic was questioned. When in 1981 the punishment of stoning to death was challenged before the federal Shariah court -- part of Pakistan's extensive Islamic legal system -- a majority of the bench agreed it was un-Islamic. But that law was later reinstated under political pressure. The point is that when the state declares some aspect of social power to be Islamic or traditional, it creates a political constituency in those who get that particular scrap of power. And once they have it they will defend it in the terms it came wrapped in, even if the ""tradition"" is new and the ""Muslim law"" even newer. In the tribal parts of Pakistan, local men are seizing more power via religion or tradition. The police quail at confronting the issuers of fatwas, no matter how political. There are exceptions, as when an imam of a mosque in Jaranwala, in the Punjab, issued a fatwa last month against Faraz Javed, who had objected to the imam's making a political sermon during Friday prayers. Mr. Javed was saved from being lynched by his American citizenship. The police swiftly arrested those who had besieged his house, proving that the state can be quite effective when it makes an effort. Less lucky was Zahid Shah, a mentally disturbed young man in another Punjabi village who was accused of blasphemy by a cleric and stoned to death by an enraged mob barely a week before the Jaranwala case. Blasphemy carries a death sentence in any case, but the accused are often killed by vigilantes. The values propagated during General Zia's long rule and entrenched in the law have been internalized by some sectors of society. No subsequent government has had the courage to reverse these laws, despite the recommendations of government commissions. An early effort by Gen. Pervez Musharraf to review blasphemy laws quickly ran into political and clerical opposition. Meanwhile, the government is gradually handing over the rights of women as citizens and indeed as human beings to tribal elders in a society that has, to a degree, long considered women as lesser beings, family property and repositories of the family honor. Rape as a form of revenge is a common phenomenon, particularly in the southern Punjab and upper Sindh region, and the use of such violence is increasing. The decision of the panchayat in Meerwala Jatoi stemmed from another aspect of the social system: the family of the woman who was raped was poor, from a low caste. Yet another tradition was brought into play. It is to the good that such cases are inspiring debate on the national level in Pakistan. The problems involved in cases like this are not unique to Pakistan and the debate should not be, either. General Zia's notions of Islamic law, for example, were partly foreign in inspiration. This is not to shift blame but to acknowledge that forms of traditionalism and fundamentalism can in a sense be modern, even late-modern, across large parts of the world -- and that they can and should be contested in modern, usually secular terms without any loss of cultural or religious identity. In Pakistan and many other places, this is the fight now. It is hardly abstract. It is fought over the bodies of girls and women, and sometimes over the bodies of boys. In the end, the state must assert its right and responsibility to protect all its citizens. The culprits in acts like this now-famous panchayat-law rape must be punished, but in accordance with law. And the affected family must be tended to with sensitivity and care. Surely that cannot be in violation of any traditions or beliefs worth keeping.",2002,"Pakistan"
"58","Rape by Decree: A Pakistani Horror","Asia","To the Editor: Re ""Brutality Cloaked as Tradition,"" by Beena Sarwar (Op-Ed, Aug. 6): In bringing to justice those responsible for gang-raping a woman as punishment for her brother's alleged crime, Pakistan would be enforcing its own Constitution. The hudood ordinances, currently in force in Pakistan, require four adult male Muslim witnesses to prove a charge of rape, making a mockery of the constitutional right to equality as well as Pakistan's obligations under international law. Pakistan signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 1996 and also pledged through the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action to revoke laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice.

"59","Pakistani Rape Victims","Asia","To the Editor: One of the saddest and most infuriating things about the plight of rape victims in Pakistan is that none of it is news (""In Pakistan, Rape Victims Are the 'Criminals,' "" news article, May 17). The world has known about such practices for as long as they have been going on. While the United States and many other countries have been quite willing to condemn apartheid in South Africa and undemocratic governments and practices in other parts of the world, we seem willing to accept the stoning of rape victims as merely a difference in cultural values. By not taking human rights abuses against women seriously, the world community is implicitly condoning the belief that women deserve less than full recognition as human beings.

"60","Rights of Women: More Than a Treaty","Asia","To the Editor: Re ""Women's Rights: Why Not?,"" by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, June 18): In 2001, Pakistan's government established an independent and autonomous National Commission on the Status of Women. Pakistan is a signer of the Convention on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. Pakistan gives representation to women in local government to the extent of 33 percent. Women are also open to fight for general seats; 60 seats are reserved for women in the National Assembly, to a guaranteed representation of 188 seats in the National and Provincial Assemblies. The inequalities in education should be removed by 2010, when the gender gap in primary education is planned to be closed. Meanwhile, Pakistan is doing its best to liberate women from the crippling handicap of illiteracy, poverty, deprivation and powerlessness.

"61","Fighting to Protect Her Gift to Japanese Women","Asia","IN the back of a theater here, two gray-haired women perched on the edge of their seats, nodding their heads, clapping their hands silently. On the stage, Beate Sirota Gordon, a snowy-haired American grandmother, implored Japanese women to rise in defense of the Japanese Constitution's equal rights clause, which was fundamental, she said, to their rights as women. She should know. At age 22, she wrote it. ''Japanese women should keep fighting for their rights,'' Beate-san, as she is known here, said in Japanese to applause from the sold-out crowd. For half a century, Ms. Gordon and the 24 other Americans who drafted Japan's Constitution in six intense days in 1946 kept a pact of silence sworn to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the postwar American occupation commander. That broke down about a decade ago, and since then Ms. Gordon has left the comfort of retirement and her Manhattan apartment once or twice a year for a lecture tour in Japan. But now she finds herself, at 81, at the front of a drive by Japanese women to protect ''her'' Article 24, which proclaims ''the essential equality of the sexes.'' Last year, a constitutional panel of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party denounced the women's rights article as promoting ''egoism in postwar Japan, leading to the collapse of family and community.'' ''I never thought they would attack it,'' said Ms. Gordon, who only a few years ago was lionized in ''A String of Pearls,'' a Japanese play about the writing of the Constitution, as seen through her eyes. Conservatives blame the ''American imposed'' clause for a variety of social ills, including a plunging marriage rate, an anemic birthrate and increasing delinquency in the schools. The clause seems safe for now, but only because the conservatives decided in April to concentrate on winning parliamentary approval to change Article 9, which prohibits Japan from using war to settle disputes. ''It is a threat, and the women realize that, and that is why they are so vociferous,'' Ms. Gordon said, referring to the reception she received on a punishing eight-city, 12-event speaking and interview tour through Japan in April. ''Beate's Gift,'' a movie about the legacy of the equal rights amendment, recently opened in theaters around Japan. Hurried through production to parry conservative arguments, the movie splices interviews with successful professional women with Ms. Gordon's account of writing the equal rights article. ''There are now women governors, women mayors, women who are in the media, filmmakers, writers, presidents of companies,'' Ms. Gordon said at the movie's April 30 debut. ''There are women who don't know what has gone on before. Knowing how different it was 60 years ago will encourage them to go on and protect these rights.'' A RARE witness to history, Beate-san arrived in Japan at age 5 in 1929, traveling with her parents, Jewish emigres, on a ship from Vladivostok, Russia. Her father, a pianist, was embarking on what became 16 years of teaching and giving concerts in Japan. Her first memory is arriving at Yokohama Harbor, looking at the dock crowded with people with black hair and black eyes, and asking, ''Mama, are they all brothers and sisters?'' But within a decade she had acculturated, learning fluent Japanese through her contact with the stream of artists and intellectuals coming to the house. But she retained an outsider's eye. ''I saw the women walking behind the men in the street,'' she recalled. ''I saw how the mothers prepared the food when the husband came home with his friends from the office. She would serve them dinner, without even talking, then go into the kitchen with the children.'' As a teenager, she recalled, Japanese girlfriends would ''prepare for marriage, learning flower arranging, but would not even meet their future husbands.'' The outbreak of war caught her at Mills College in Oakland, Calif., and her parents at home in Tokyo. During the war she made American government radio broadcasts beamed to Japan, researched Japan for Time magazine, and, in January 1945, became a United States citizen. After the war she raced to Tokyo to track down her parents, who had been detained in a mountain village. As one of a handful of Caucasians with a strong command of Japanese, she became the translator for the constitution writers. General MacArthur rejected two attempts by Japanese politicians to write constitutions that did little to weaken the country's feudal society and the role of the emperor, and decided the Americans would have to do it. The general's lawyer, Brig. Gen. Courtney Whitney, ''called us in and said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, you are now a constitutional assembly and you will now write a new draft of the Japanese Constitution, and it has to be done in seven days,''' she recalled. ''We were stunned.'' In her memoir, ''The Only Woman in the Room,'' she recounts how in the grueling week of debates, almost all of the clauses that emerged from her Underwood typewriter ended up in the trash basket. ''Colonel Kades said, 'My God, you have given Japanese women more rights than in the American Constitution,''' she recalled, referring to Lt. Col. Charles L. Kades, head of the constitutional steering committee. ''I said, 'Colonel Kades, that's not very difficult to do, because women are not in the American Constitution.''' The test came when the draft was submitted to a group of Japanese ministers and politicians for approval. Japan's prewar Constitution stated, ''Women are to be regarded as incompetent.'' In 1946, Japanese women had virtually no rights of inheritance, property or divorce, or even to choose their own husbands. ''Immediately they said, 'This doesn't fit our culture, doesn't fit our history; it doesn't fit our way of life,''' Ms. Gordon said of a 2 a.m. confrontation. But during the previous 14 hours of debates, the young American woman had won the gratitude of the Japanese leaders for backing them in previous disagreements with the Americans. As she recalled it, ''Colonel Kades said, 'Miss Sirota has her heart set on the women's rights clause, so why don't we pass it?''' Asked what ''her'' article said, Ms. Gordon started reciting the text, then faltered. ''Oh, I have it right here,'' she said, pulling from around her neck a pink printed silk scarf. ''This was made by my fan club here.'' ''Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis,'' she said, reading the scarf, which was printed in the six languages she speaks -- English, Japanese, Russian, German, French and Spanish. ''With regard to choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters pertaining to marriage and the family, laws shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes.'' For critics who say these are imported concepts, Ms. Gordon told her audience that many of Japan's core cultural attributes were borrowed from overseas -- Buddhism, ceramics, ancient court music and the character writing system. Conservatives who want to turn the clock back to more traditional roles for women will not succeed, she maintained. ''After 60 years, it would be very hard to amend it now, it is so much part of Japan's culture.''

President Musharraf's remarks in the United States were sadly misinterpreted.

Much is being made of the fact that she will be the first woman to fill this position, but the hype disregards both the largely ceremonial nature of the role and the reality of gender inequality in the country. Women occupy only 9 percent of seats in Parliament, of which a mere 3.4 percent are at the ministerial level. They fill less than 3 percent of seats in the high courts and Supreme Court. They make up 48 percent of the work force, but earn only 31 paise to every rupee of their male colleagues.

"65","Goa Points the Way for Women","Asia","""After you have spent some time in relatively conservative northern India, the state of Goa can give the impression of a feminist paradise - especially this year, when women have been unusually successful in running for key posts in the powerful local village councils, "" Nilanjana S. Roy wrote for The International Herald Tribune. The ""state's village councils are active and engaged, and to have so many female 'sarpanches,' or council heads, elected in one year is, to many, a very encouraging sign,"" Ms. Roy wrote. In some areas, like the popular resort towns of Calangute and Candolim, ""women have become council heads this year through the application of affirmative action policies,"" she wrote. ""But in Salcete, 42 percent of the successful candidates were women - including many who won their seats in general wards, not just in constituencies reserved for women."" Traveling around Goa, especially in the inland villages away from the more well-visited areas, the contrast between the lives of women in rural northern India and here is stark. Except for a few high-crime areas, most women here can expect a much higher level of personal safety than women in Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, two of the north's largest states. That sense of security is evident in the number of women on the roads and other public spaces in Goa, even after dark - and in the freedom with which they live and work. Women have significantly greater land rights in Goa, thanks to the Common Civil Code dating back to the days of Portuguese colonial rule. Under the code, elements of which survived the Indian annexation of Goa in 1961, women are entitled to a share in both parental and marital property. Read the full article.",2012,"India"
"66","Anderson Cooper's Coming Out Rattles China's Closet","Asia","BEIJING - When Anderson Cooper, the CNN anchor, recently announced that he was gay, he apparently inspired a Chinese microblogger using the name Sun Yelin-Xiao Hei. On Thursday, Mr. Sun posted a call on Sina's Weibo, or microblogging, site for Chinese homosexuals to come out en masse on Dec. 12, 2012 - a day apparently picked for its neat number. If you read Chinese, you can read his exhortation here. Mr. Cooper is fairly well-known among China's more Westernized, educated elite, with Sina's microblog site, the country's biggest, recording over 38,000 posts mentioning him. Comments since his coming out have been overwhelmingly positive, if occasionally a little nonplussed. In China, very few homosexuals are ""out,"" or ""chugui"" (this translates as ""come out closet."") Familial and cultural pressures to be heterosexual, marry and produce an heir are simply too great. So Mr. Sun seemed to be inviting the world to dream: ""If on 2012.12.12 all the homosexuals in China 'chugui,' "" he wrote enthusiastically, ""what would life be like?"" There's little chance of finding out. If anything, the recent wave of casual, ""I'm gay, so what"" announcements by prominent Americans is underscoring a fast-widening gap in social attitudes between the United States and many other countries, including China. Zhang Beichuan, a leading researcher on homosexuality and a medical professor at Qingdao University, says China faces an epidemic of problems related to the nonacceptance of homosexuality, including AIDS transmission from gay men to their wives and unhappy marriages in which one partner is secretly gay. ""I really want to say something,"" he confided in a telephone interview from Qingdao. ""China really needs help and encouragement from the progressive sectors of international society to solve these problems."" One particular area of concern, Mr. Zhang said, is the large number of Chinese women unwittingly married to gay men. (Due to traditional patriarchal attitudes that value a son's offspring more than a daughter's, it is somewhat easier for a woman to dodge marriage and reproduction. A gay woman may be less likely to marry against her will.) Mr. Zhang estimates that more than 90 percent of China's gay men bow to pressure and marry women - without revealing their homosexuality. ""There are over 10 million women married to homosexual men, perhaps 16 million,"" he said. (Mr. Zhang's estimate is based on the number of Chinese marriages, surveys of gay men's life plans and a gay male population of 3.5 percent. There is no universally accepted statistic for gay populations, of course, but the most common global estimates are 2 to 5 percent.) ""We have so many women in unhappy, loveless marriages in China,"" he said. ""Inside this story, there are so many tears, so much pain."" Giving men the freedom to come out of the closet would solve the problem, said Mr. Zhang. In fact, the topic is widely debated here, but in unofficial media and in private. Sina's Weibo records more than 4.5 million posts for ""chugui."" Yet, in his role as counselor as well as researcher, Mr. Zhang said, ""We don't lightly recommend to people that they come out. It can have a tremendously damaging impact on their lives."" He cited examples in which parents threatened suicide or fell seriously ill, or the children were forced to flee home. Until recently, women married to gay men had a champion: Yao Lifen, a woman in the western city of Xi'an, who ran a Web site offering emotional, practical and legal support for women married to homosexuals, China Daily reported. ""Tongqi jiayuan,"" the Chinese name of her Web site, roughly translates as ""A Home for the Wives of Homosexuals."" Married for years to a gay man who, she told China Daily, beat her (Mr. Zhang says domestic violence is common in these marriages, the result of deep frustrations and poor communication), Ms. Yao set out to help other women. Yet her Web site, www.tongqijiayuan.com, is currently shut down, after complaints to the police from clients that they were charged money for services that never materialized, according to a report in Nanfang Daily. In an email to Rendezvous, Ms. Yao said she was innocent of the charges and that she had been deceived by her boyfriend, who worked on the project with her. She said she learned only in May that her boyfriend ""went behind my back to collect money from some women married to gay men. I am extremely angry and hurt."" She said he changed information on the Web site without her knowledge to cheat people. Her boyfriend's whereabouts were unclear and he could not be reached for comment. Mr. Zhang called the shuttering of Ms. Yao's Web site ""a disaster"" for these wives, for many of whom it was the only source of support. Many Chinese women married to homosexual men never realize their spouses are gay due to ignorance about homosexuality, Mr. Zhang said. ""The level of information available to Chinese and to American women is very different,"" he said. Chinese women married to gay men ""blame themselves,"" he said. ""They think it's because they aren't good enough."" ""I blame the government because it is so powerful but the information it offers is totally inadequate,"" he said. ""Education has got to include homosexuality. What we need is not traditional education that ignores the issue, but a much more humane education that addresses it,"" he said. Just a dozen people have so far responded to Sun Yelin-Xiao Hei's online call for a mass coming out. ""Very cool! There's strength in numbers!"" posted one person using the name Yuecai Diancai wo dou ai.",2012,"China"
"67","Will Indian Women Ever Have the Freedom Not to Marry?","Asia","Behind the Bollywood dream of the Great Indian Wedding, complete with white horse and brass bands, the reality for many Indian women is stark: there isn't much alternative to marriage. Does it have to be this way for the next generation? How long can tradition be used to justify marrying off women before they're old enough to make good choices - or to pressure women into marriage, because being single is not a culturally acceptable choice? As I discuss in my latest column, except for a small sliver of the urban middle and upper classes, most young women will have only token control over what is considered the defining decision of their lives. As I write, in modern India, ""most girls and women are still defined by one major life event - marriage."" What marriage means, even today, for many women was articulated by a bright 19-year-old, Sunita Devi, who had been sent to a naturopathycenter outside Delhi by her prospective in-laws. They wanted her to lose five kilograms, more than 10 pounds, before the wedding. It was just one of the many changes that underlined how little of her life would remain the same. She would move to a different town, give up her dreams of running her own business, and even change her first name, in keeping with the tradition in her mother-in-law's family. ""Even my weight is under their control,"" she said, laughing. In exchange, she hoped for some independence of her own and the status accorded to a married woman. Perhaps migration to the cities will shift the balance for the next generation of young women, giving them a taste of independence. Some analysts hope that more role models and greater economic opportunities will help. Marriage may still be the primary choice for young women -but should it be the only choice?",2012,"India"
"68","Women in China Face Rising University Entry Barriers","Asia","BEIJING -- On the last day of August, Xiong Jing and two friends shaved their heads in Beijing to protest a growing trend in Chinese universities in which women increasingly must score higher than men to get in and face unofficial but widespread gender quotas that favor men. The three women were outraged when the Education Ministry said in August that the practices were in the ''national interest.'' They conducted their action in the privacy of an apartment, since any kind of protest in the Chinese capital was considered risky. The day before, in the relatively freer southern city of Guangzhou, four other women shaved their heads in public and gave the Education Ministry a ''zero'' score for fairness. In all, Ms. Xiong said, about 20 people around China -- mostly women but some sympathetic men, too -- shaved their heads to protest the rules. Their protest was inspired by three female artists who shaved their heads in public here in March to call for greater women's rights. ''The Education Ministry's response made us really angry -- it's just such a pity,'' Ms. Xiong said in an interview in Beijing, her normally shoulder-length hair reduced to stubble. ''It's illegal too. The Education Law forbids discrimination on several grounds including gender. And the Education Ministry is allowing it.'' No one is quite sure when gender quotas and gender-based admission scores were first implemented; but by now, they appear to be deeply entrenched, according to Chinese news reports that published publicly available admission criteria for the gaokao, the nationwide university entrance exam, as evidence. Several of the universities in question, including the University of International Relations, declined to respond to requests for information, referring queries to the college's propaganda or international affairs offices, which did not respond. An official who answered the telephone at the Teaching Office at the China University of Political Science and Law said the school did not have gender-based enrollment policies. For criminology, she said, ''female students must account for less than 15 percent of students because of the nature of their future career,'' but women were scoring so well that in practice a higher percentage were being admitted. She declined to give her name and did not elaborate on her comment. The practice began at least as early as 2005, according to Chinese news reports, and was in response to the rising numbers of women getting into universities, where they are starting to outstrip men in some areas, especially languages. In 2004, women made up 43.8 percent of undergraduate students, rising to 49.6 by 2012, according to Education Ministry figures cited by The 21st Century Business Herald. In master's programs, women made up 44.1 percent of students in 2004, rising to 50.3 by 2010. Among doctoral candidates in 2010, however, just over 35.4 percent were women, up from 31.3 in 2004. In July, the Southern Metropolis Daily, a newspaper in Guangzhou, said the practice of discriminating in admissions was ''extremely clear,'' calling it ''the male-female difference.'' ''In science courses at the China University of Political Science and Law, the bar is at 632 points for women but 588 for men,'' the newspaper said, providing other similar examples from other colleges. The practice was especially entrenched at police or military-affiliated universities, it noted. It was also common at language schools. It was reported in July that the Shanghai International Studies University had lowered the bar of entry for male applicants to language programs in Hebrew, Arabic, Ukrainian, Korean and Russian. University administrators ''believe that Arab nations don't want to deal with women,'' Ms. Xiong said. ''So they make it harder for women to get in to study Arabic,'' a language that is not commonly studied in China. The reports led Lu Pin, a program manager at the Media Monitor for Women Network, to join with a lawyer, Huang Yizhi, to file an ''open information'' request with the Education Ministry. ''Comrade Lu Pin,'' the ministry responded on Aug. 22. ''In view of considerations of national interest,'' to meet personnel training needs in some job areas or specialties, ''a few colleges may appropriately adjust the enrollment ratios of men and women.'' It ended with a friendly salutation: ''Thank you for your support of the open government information work of the Education Ministry!'' The rules affected students like Ouyang Le, according to Ms. Xiong. A fresh graduate from a Guangzhou high school, Ms. Ouyang had wanted to study at the University of International Relations. She scored 614 points on the gaokao, but as a woman, needed 628. If Ms. Ouyang had been a man, she would have needed just 609. Ms. Xiong said Ms. Ouyang, who contacted the activists to recount her story, was a rare case -- most young women do not speak up, instead silently switching their major or university. ''They are so young and inexperienced, and then their parents often advise them not to make trouble,'' Ms. Xiong said. She added that it was difficult to know how many women were affected every year but that the number could run in the hundreds or thousands. Feminists are deeply worried by the trend. ''Young women today have real opportunities to study, and that they are becoming so outstanding is really to their credit, their families' credit and to the country's credit,'' said Ms. Lu, the Media Monitor program monitor. ''They worked so hard to get these high grades. And we cannot accept that the Education Ministry is infringing on their rights. They must respect their own laws.'' Dissatisfied with the ministry response, which they said was ''very vague,'' Ms. Lu and Ms. Huang have filed a second request for information, asking what constitutes ''national interest,'' and what are the ''special subjects'' that give grounds for gender discrimination. The issue is much discussed on campuses, where women in some arts faculties in particular may heavily outnumber men, making up to 70 percent of students in some classes. But women still lag in many science programs, where there are not similar efforts made to increase their numbers with weighted admissions standards. At a school specializing in rocket and aviation research at the Beijing Institute of Technology, women made up 13.8 percent of students in 2008, rising to 16.4 in 2011, The 21st Century Business Herald reported. In the news media, the phenomenon increasingly is being called the ''kingdom of women'' or the ''detachment of women,'' using military terminology. He Qin, the deputy chairman of the Students' Union at the School of Foreign Languages at Huazhong Agricultural University in Hubei Province, said the lack of men studying languages caused practical problems, the newspaper reported. At the beginning of the semester, new female students arrive ''one after another,'' Mr. He was quoted as saying. ''We have to lead the way to their dormitory, and due to not enough manpower they have to carry their suitcases to the sixth floor,'' he added. ''The hands are sore to the point of losing consciousness.'' Yang Jianxiong, one of 13 male students in his class at the School of Plant Science at the university, said he felt ''humiliated'' at the rising number of female students, the newspaper reported. This year, the school enrolled 442 students, of whom 238 were women, or 54 percent. ''Boys are now inferior to girls in terms of both number and scores,'' Mr. Yang said. ''Girls win the majority of scholarships and praise each year.'' Women's higher admissions rates may be all the more remarkable since in China, 118 boys are born for every 100 girls -- by a simple law of averages, more boys should be getting in. But under the country's one-child policy, single girls are getting the attention and support that once only their brothers did, accounting for their catch-up, experts say. The skewed gender ratio at birth shows a strong cultural preference for boys and indicates how far Chinese women have triumphed against traditional discrimination, including in education. Tang Shangshu, a counselor at the School of Plant Sciences, said that relatively speaking, boys matured later, while girls had better study habits, the 21st Century Business Herald reported. In addition, Mr. Tang said that many jobs that once required physical labor had been replaced by labor-saving science and technologies. That had removed women's physical disadvantage, while ''in terms of wisdom boys may not have particularly obvious advantages,'' Mr. Tang told the newspaper.",2012,"China"
"69","China's 'Leftover' Women","Asia","BEIJING -- The headlines scream like sensational tabloids: ''Overcoming the Big Four Emotional Blocks: Leftover Women Can Break out of Being Single.'' ''Eight Simple Moves to Escape the Leftover Women Trap.'' And my personal favorite: ''Do Leftover Women Really Deserve Our Sympathy?'' These eye-catching topics do not appear in supermarket-aisle gossip magazines. They are articles about single, professional women published on the Web site of China's state feminist agency, the All-China Women's Federation. The Communist Party founded the Women's Federation in 1949 to ''protect women's rights and interests.'' In 2007, the Women's Federation defined ''leftover'' women (sheng nu ) as unmarried women over the age of 27 and China's Ministry of Education added the term to its official lexicon. Since then, the Women's Federation Web site has run articles stigmatizing educated women who are still single. Take this uplifting column from March 2011 that ran just after International Women's Day: Pretty girls don't need a lot of education to marry into a rich and powerful family, but girls with an average or ugly appearance will find it difficult. These kinds of girls hope to further their education in order to increase their competitiveness. The tragedy is, they don't realize that as women age, they are worth less and less, so by the time they get their M.A. or Ph.D., they are already old, like yellowed pearls. After knocking some good sense into those misguided women who pursue a higher education, the column accuses educated, single women of sleeping around and having degenerate morals: Many highly educated ''leftover women'' are very progressive in their thinking and enjoy going to nightclubs to search for a one-night stand, or they become the mistress of a high official or rich man. It is only when they have lost their youth and are kicked out by the man, that they decide to look for a life partner. Therefore, most ''leftover women'' do not deserve our sympathy. Glad we got that straight. Now, why would China's state feminist agency conduct a scare-mongering campaign against single, educated women? Curious, I searched the Women's Federation Web site and found that it posted its first article on ''leftover'' women in 2007, shortly after China's State Council issued an edict on strengthening the Population and Family Planning program to address ''unprecedented population pressures.'' These pressures include the sex-ratio imbalance -- which ''causes a threat to social stability'' -- and the ''low quality of the general population, which makes it hard to meet the requirements of fierce competition for national strength,'' according to the State Council. The State Council names ''upgrading population quality (suzhi)'' as one of its key goals, and appoints the Women's Federation as a primary implementer of its population planning policy. What better way to upgrade population quality than to frighten ''high-quality'' women into marrying and having a child for the good of the nation? The Women's Federation columns on sheng nu all share the same goal: convince single, educated women to stop being so ambitious and get married already: The main reason many girls become ''leftover women'' is that their standards for a partner are too high ... As girls are not too picky, finding a partner should be as easy as blowing away a speck of dust. Some of the columns have been reposted several times over the years and list helpful tips, such as ''seduce but don't pester'' and ''be persistent but not willful'': When holding out for a man, if you say he must be rich and brilliant, romantic and hardworking ... this is just being willful. Does this kind of perfect man exist? Maybe he does exist, but why on earth would he want to marry you? Since 2008, local population planning commissions in cities such as Nanjing and Ningbo have carried out ''interventions'' to address the ''leftover women crisis.'' Local Women's Federation branches have arranged matchmaking events for ''highly educated, high-quality'' women. This March there was a drive in Pinghu, Zhejiang Province, for ''leftover women to speedily find conjugal happiness.'' And once a ''leftover'' woman finds marital bliss, what should she do if her husband has an affair? The Women's Federation comes to the rescue, with the headline, ''Faced With A Marital Crisis, Women Need to Improve Themselves'': When you find out that he is having an affair, you may be in a towering rage, but you must know that if you make a fuss, you are denying the man ''face'' ... No man is capable of spending a lifetime being loyal to an outmoded wife who never changes ... Try changing your hairstyle or your fashion. Women must constantly change for the better. In short, it's the woman's fault for refusing to get married, and once she is married, it's the woman's fault if her husband has an affair. Of course.

"70","Bihar Village Bans Women and Girls From Using Mobile Phones","Asia","PATNA, Bihar -- A village council in the state of Bihar this week prohibited unmarried women and girls from using mobile phones, saying that they promote extramarital affairs and unsanctioned marriages and erode the moral fabric of society.  Married women will be allowed to use them only indoors and in the presence of a relative. The decree was issued Sunday by a panchayat -- an informal, unelected council -- in Sunderbari, a village of 8,000 in the Purnia district of eastern Bihar. ""Girls,"" as the council calls them, which are defined as all unmarried females, face a fine of 10,000 rupees, or $180, if they violate the order, the council said, or the equivalent of months of income for most families in the area; the fine for married women is 2,000 rupees. ""With the use of mobile phones by the girls and women, incidents of love affairs, elopement and extramarital affairs have increased in our village,"" Mohammed Manwar Alam, a panchayat member, said by telephone Tuesday. ""It is intolerable and eroding the moral fabric in our society,"" he said. Many villagers, male and female, attended a village meeting Sunday about the ban, and most favored it, particularly older people, Mr. Alam said. He presided over the meeting. The panchayat, which is made up entirely of men, also barred women from bathing outdoors, at water pumps or in ponds or canals. Sunderbari is an impoverished, predominantly Muslim village about 300 kilometers, or 190 miles, from the state capital, Patna. About 60 percent of district residents live below the poverty line. Another member of the panchayat, Mohammed Javed Iqbal, said that at least six women from the village had eloped in the past five months, which he said has hurt the village's reputation.   ""Even the married women have eloped with their lovers, dumping their husbands,"" Mr. Iqbal said. ""The easy use of mobile phones has been the real game changer in all the incidents,"" he said. The panchayat formed a social advisory committee to implement the ruling; a 10-member executive body within the committee will be in charge of enforcing it. The ban was immediately decried by women's rights activists, who said it would isolate women.  Jagmati Sangwan, vice president of the All India Democratic Women's Association, said that the men who head such village councils ""want women to get cut off from the processes of modernization, education and employment.""  She said they knew full well that such laws, targeting only one segment of society, are not legal. Similar rules made by self-appointed village councils have become commonplace in some parts of rural India, notably, of late, in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  In July, a village council in Bagpat district of Uttar Pradesh issued a decree banning ""love marriage,"" or a marriage that was not arranged, saying that those who did so would not be allowed to live in the village. They also said that women below the age of 40 could not go to the market, and unmarried women and girls would not be allowed to use mobile phones on the streets. In October, a village council member in Haryana, reacting to a series of rapes in the state, blamed the influence of movies and television and suggested that the marriage age be lowered to 16 to keep women sexually satisfied. Ms. Sangwan said she believed such statements in Haryana had emboldened panchayats in places like Bihar. These all-male panchayats, while not legally part of the governing structure of India, have deep historical roots, and their decrees are often followed faithfully by village communities. Politicians often rely on them to mobilize voters, which means their power increases around elections, experts say. Sandeep Kumar R Pudakalkatti, the Purnia district magistrate, has opened an investigation into the Sunderbari panchayat's move; he told the BBC that if the edict is unlawful, ""necessary action will be taken against those guilty."" Another district official, Sanjay Kumar, a block development officer, said in an interview that he planned to visit the village himself to ensure that the reports are true. ""Such a diktat cannot be allowed in a democratic society,"" he said. ""It is unlawful."" The village's top elected official, Shamina Khatoon, a woman, was not invited to the panchayat's meeting on Sunday. Neha Thirani contributed reporting to this article from Mumbai.",2012,"India"
"71","Gender Equality","Asia","Author of ''The Beauty Myth'' and ''Vagina: A New Biography'' When I hear the words ''gender equality,'' or ''feminism,'' I am always baffled as to why these concepts could ever be contentious. To me, these ideas are so mainstream, so much a part of our basic cultural heritage. What ''gender equality'' or ''feminism'' should mean -- I suppose if gender equality is the goal, feminism is the process of how we get there -- is the logical extension of the core idea of democracy. I date my feminism to the Enlightenment -- to Mary Wollstonecraft, who wrote, at the end of the 18th century, ''A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.'' Her essay was squarely aligned with other Enlightenment thinkers' appeals to reason, to the rights of man, and to the notion of equality of dignity among all people. This Enlightenment vision is so powerful, and so right, that it has spread around the world, from the ''one person, one vote'' advocates in Sierra Leone, to the Tahrir Square protesters in Egypt, to the furious parents in Sichuan Province in China, who fought the regional Communist Party's refusal to release information about how their children died in a poorly-built school during an earthquake. Underlying all of these movements is the democratic ideal from the 1790s that asserts: No one person has the natural right to suppress, silence or dominate any other person, simply because of where both are situated in society. But what that set of beliefs isn't is as important as what it is. Feminism, in my view, should always have kept that original precept in sight as it pursued its aims from one generation to the next. It doesn't prescribe lifestyle choices. It doesn't dictate sexual decisions. It doesn't define itself in terms of cultural battles. True feminism empowers anyone to be free and to have equal opportunity and access to equal legal rights and the rule of law. But it doesn't dictate what that free person should be doing with her or his freedom. Unfortunately, Western feminism is too often bogged down in cultural battles, in asserting a checklist of political policies. For two decades, I have been insisting that there can certainly be a right-wing, a libertarian, and a left- wing feminist agenda -- because what makes a ''feminist'' is not the policy outcome. Democracy is a concatenation of voices arising out of many individual free lives. I think we need to reassert our Enlightenment heritage in the fight for gender justice in the West. The feminists of Africa, Asia and the Middle East have now outstripped Western feminists as pioneers for gender justice -- partly because they do not see women's fight for justice as pitting them against men, against family life or even against faith. They draw on the Wollstonecraftian heritage of democracy and human rights, which is very hard to mock or dismiss. Writer and diplomat, most recently special adviser to Hillary Clinton I grew up with seven sisters. I tolerated boy bands. I learned to put the seat down. I also witnessed the power of women's leadership. My childhood dinner-table fights would still be raging without steely negotiation from girls. Years later, watching an argument rage in a dusty Islamic classroom in Dhaka, Bangladesh, I remember seeing that same power. At first, only the men talked. But finally, Nipa Masud, seated in the back with a dangerous glint in her eye, leapt to her feet, unleashed a torrent of critiques. The floodgates open, every girl spoke up, swiftly ending the debate. The girls didn't speak first, but they spoke loudest. There can be no confronting our challenges without those voices. Countries with more women in their governments are less likely to suffer internal armed conflicts. Goldman Sachs projected that leveling women's and men's employment rates would add 9 percent to the United States' G.D.P., 13 percent to Europe's, and 16 percent to Japan's. In some ways, we are closer to securing equal space for women to participate than ever. Gender gaps in primary and secondary education rates are closing. More than half a billion women joined the work force over the last 30 years. But women everywhere still face senseless obstacles. In October, militants in Pakistan gunned down 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai for her activism supporting girls' education. Countless stories like hers never reach the world. It is up to all of us to protect women, their rights and their opportunities. In a recent McKinsey survey of successful female businesswomen, an overwhelming majority said they don't aspire to top positions. Women who have made it to the top need to stay there and fight for a world where Nipa, Malala, and countless girls like them are not just able, but expected, to lead. Episcopal priest and Executive Director of the Interfaith Center of New York Were you to stop someone in the street and ask them if the world's great religious traditions would help or hinder the achievement of gender equality, my guess is they would conclude that religion was a hindrance. In Christianity and Judaism, the first book of the Bible, Genesis, describes Eve emerging from Adam's rib. A few lines later, Eve succumbs to the serpent's temptation, takes a bite of the forbidden fruit and offers it to her partner. For centuries, authorities within the church patriarchy attributed to Eve the majority portion of guilt for original sin and taught that the pains of childbirth were just atonement for Eve's misstep. With so many obstacles like this within many religious traditions, what possible hope could there be for gender equality unless humanity becomes less religious? There is an alternative. I would propose that a less-religious world is not one in which gender equality will be more quickly achieved. Indeed, Christianity has untapped resources when it comes to achieving gender equality: Today's women of faith who occupy two-thirds of the pew benches in churches around the globe. It is a matter of time before we will share power with men of our faith. From an earlier passage in Genesis come the explicit instructions that both men and women are created in the image of God: ''So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.'' (Genesis 1:27). These words offer hope and a way forward. Head of HSBC India The reality of gender equality is complex and diverse, even more so in India. What is theoretically simple -- that men and women have the same rights and opportunities in every walk of life -- is more difficult to implement and measure. An increasing number of companies recognize that a healthier gender mix makes for good business, helping talent retention and enhanced innovation. What must also be recognized is the revolution in the smaller towns and villages that is even more important, as it will impact a larger number of women. HSBC has given me opportunities to interact with rural women in India and I have seen their contributions and progress -- albeit at a slow pace -- at close hand. Once a woman steps out to earn her livelihood, she becomes independent, not just economically but psychologically. She gains better control over the family's finances and acquires stronger decision-making powers. With a rise in the number of schools and vocational training centers, women everywhere now have the opportunity to gain knowledge and acquire skills. As a result, we see women from smaller regions in India becoming engineers, doctors and even astronauts, which was unimaginable a few decades ago. I remain optimistic on the ever-greater participation of women in public, corporate and political decision-making. British journalist and author of ''How to Be a Woman'' and ''Moranthology'' Gender equality simply means ''women being equal to men'' -- however nuts, dim, deluded, underachieving or ill-kempt the men may be. I mean none of this to belittle menfolk. On the contrary. As a woman, that's the bit I want in on. That's the sweet stuff. For when we imagine the fully emancipated 21st-century woman, we are apt to think of some toned, immaculately dressed overachiever, leading a Fortune 500 company while bringing up bilingual twins. And that's what simultaneously stresses women out to the point of living on a Pinot Grigio drip, and terrifies insecure men. This idea of perfect, sexy, superhuman lady-titans, winning at everything. That's what scuppers moves toward gender equality. For my feminist money, I don't see gender equality as ''women exhausting themselves to be more incredible than any other human beings have ever been at any other point in time.'' Mainly because it sounds a) pretty unlikely to happen terribly often and b) like a massive administrative headache. For me, true equality would be getting in on a bit of that male, ''14 pounds overweight but I don't care,'' ''getting sexier as I get older,'' ''confidently chipping in at meetings with crazy idea,'' ''I definitely need some golfing me-time'' action, instead. While one hugely important part of equality is to have extraordinary people's achievements facilitated and recognized -- whatever their gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion or ability to accessorize -- an arguably even bigger part of equality is for everyone to feel comfortable being a massively average schlump.This, clearly, is not the case for women, who treat themselves like a massive ''To Do'' list. What an intolerable burden! And that's why gender equality means ''women being equal to men'' -- however nuts, dim, deluded, underachieving or ill-kempt the men may be. Yachtswoman and charity founder I am a sailor and have been, at the pinnacle of my racing career, the fastest solo sailor to ever circumnavigate the globe. Focus, hard work and belief in one's potential do not have a gender. Offshore sailing is one of the rare sports that offers the opportunity for men and women to compete on equal terms, so was my gender relevant? I never thought so. This does of course not mean that, in the grand scheme of things, gender equality is a nonissue and that we live in a fair, balanced world. But in my particular case, it has no importance and in fact focusing on that specific element would equate to missing the bigger picture. By analogy, and to talk about things that occupy my life now that I've created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, only looking at one piece of the economic puzzle will not give you the full scope. Taking a restrictive approach to complex issues amounts to flicking one switch on a giant switchboard, not considering its impact on others. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation aims to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by shifting away from the ''take-make-dispose'' model we've inherited from the Industrial Revolution. What we're talking about is a systems-level change, not tweaks to the existing model. The circular economy keeps materials flowing so they can be used and reused, while waste is phased out by design. When it comes to reinventing progress, we need all the determination, creativity, enthusiasm and talent we can get. And these have no gender. Columnist for The New York Times We'll know we have gender equality when we're no longer talking about it. And this is definitely achievable. One of the problems with journalists and humanitarian organizations is that we're sometimes so focused on problems that we don't adequately acknowledge the progress that is being made. And that progress on gender issues is pretty stunning. Look at the education gap. In the United States it has disappeared, with girls doing better than boys in school. Globally, the education gap in primary school has disappeared as well and although it persists in secondary school it is diminishing. Even a poor Muslim country like Bangladesh now has more girls in high school than boys. In the United States, rape and other kinds of sexual violence seem to have diminished significantly (as best we can figure from flawed reporting), in part because the police now take date rape seriously. Domestic violence is now often taken seriously by American police departments and more and more police departments abroad are starting to tackle it as well. Sex trafficking remains a huge issue around the world, but traffickers are now sometimes going to jail. It's striking that every aid organization and N.G.O. now seems to market itself as focused on women and girls. Even in the State Department and the Pentagon, officials recognize that a focus on girls' education is useful to bring about stability and change. So I imagine a world a couple of decades from now where sex trafficking is largely behind us, where girls have as much chance to go to school as boys, where reproductive health for women isn't a taboo. We will all be benefiting from a more equal world, and then finally we can stop talking about gender equality. American doctoral candidate in Tsinghua University's Department of Sociology A century ago, Chinese feminists fighting for the emancipation of women helped spark the Republican revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. After the Communist revolution of 1949, Mao proclaimed that ''women hold up half the sky.'' In the early years of the People's Republic, the Communist Party sought to transform gender relations with expansive initiatives such as assigning urban women jobs in the planned economy. Yet those gains are now being eroded in China's post-socialist era. Women's labor force participation has fallen dramatically, the wealth gap is widening, and women's legal rights to property are under attack. So what would gender equality in China look like? All parents would welcome their baby girl into the world with as much love as if she were a boy. Rural parents would give a plot of family land to their daughter as well as their son. Villages would protect women's rights to land. Urban parents would no longer buy their son an expensive apartment while leaving their daughter to fend for herself. Young women applying to university wouldn't need to outscore men to gain admission. The state feminist agency would no longer shame single, professional women over the age of 27 by calling them ''leftover.'' Women who report domestic violence wouldn't be blamed for ''exposing family ugliness.'' The saying ''men belong in public, women belong at home'' would become a relic of history. Half of the country's leaders would be women. Is gender equality achievable? Yes. It may take several generations, but it is worth fighting for.",2012,"China"
"72","Eighth Sister? In Asia, Campuses for Women","Asia","In May, the Asian University for Women  is expected to graduate its first class of 138 students, almost all of whom come from deprived backgrounds and rely on scholarships to pay for the $15,000 that room, board and school fees would cost. In an IHT Female Factor Special Report, Bettina Wassener visited its campus in Chittagong, Bangladesh, a modest complex that has drawn young women from states as diverse as Afghanistan, China, the Palestinian territories and Indonesia. Most would not have had a chance at an English-language university-level education on a multicultural campus. Now, some of these young women are on exchanges as far-flung as Stanford University in the United States and the Institut d'Études Politiques in France. The A.U.W.'s founder, Kamal Ahmad, is a native of Bangladesh who was educated in the United States; the grant to use the land is from Bangladesh itself. But the majority of the support comes from the West: Cherie Blair, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,  the Rockefeller Foundation, the IKEA Foundation and the U.S. State Department. The search for funds is still on as the A.U.W. slowly works toward building a larger campus. The A.U.W. has inspired a somewhat different project in Malaysia. Kelly Wetherille   talks to Barbara Hou, formerly of the Bangladeshi school, who now wants to build an Asian Women's Leadership University. The A.W.L.U., expected to open in 2015, would be modeled on the Seven Sisters, the elite U.S. liberal arts colleges established originally as women's educational institutions.  Her vision is for a school in a relatively affluent area with the majority of students paying full tuition, and about a quarter on scholarship. While young women may be achieving equality in the classroom, there is another fight going in the upper echelons of academia, where women compete with men for research positions, professorships and executive posts. As Liz Gooch reports,  more than one-third of the higher education institutions in the Philippines are headed by women. Thailand is also a surprising bright spot in this regard. But they are exceptions. In Asia, only 18 percent of university researchers are women, compared to 29 percent worldwide. Fanny M. Cheung of the Chinese University of Hong Kong was blunt in her assessment of the social realities that might hold women back. She called the child-bearing years the ""golden age"" for academics. She also said that, in China in particular, women may hesitate before pursuing a Ph.D. because it might frighten off potential husbands. ""It takes a very confident man to be able to accept a wife who is in a so-called superior position because, by virtue of a higher degree, you will be considered more superior,"" she said. ""In Asia that is still a fairly strong barrier."" Didi Kirsten Tatlow attended a training session in Bangkok that turned the issue of women's rights on its head. Instead of educating women, the session focused on educating men. The idea is that no amount of progress by women- and no number of well-meaning projects- would be enough if men themselves did not change.  According to the United Nations' Partners in Prevention, more than half of men interviewed in Bangladesh said they had been violent against women. One in five men in Cambodia admitted to committing rape. The list of reasons - sexual entitlement, alcohol, fun, anger and punishment - were just as alarming as the statistics. Somsouk Sananikone, an activist in Laos, said that it was important to education young men, in particular, before they engaged in these behaviors. ""We're looking at how every man may become violence, not just those who are already violent,"" he said.",2012,"Bangladesh"
"73","Divorce Curb Is Dividing Feminists In China","Asia","Proposals to make divorce more difficult and to punish adulterers have stirred a rare and passionate public debate here, with opinions clashing in newspapers, radio call-in shows and television specials around the country. The proposals, included in early drafts of a new law on marriage and family, were prompted by concern about a rising divorce rate and reports that more rich men are supporting mistresses, widely known as ""little honeys,"" or leaving their wives to marry younger women. Women's advocates have been bitterly split by the proposals, with some calling them needed protections for women while many younger feminists and sociologists calling them a regressive move in a country where the Communists have a history of paternalistic meddling. ""These people still want to use the Government to interfere in people's private lives,"" said Li Yinhe, a sociologist, referring to the legal experts, mostly older women, who drafted the proposals. Ms. Li, an expert on sex issues at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is one of the most vociferous opponents. ""We need to make a distinction between law and morality,"" she said. Under an onslaught of criticism, the authors of the proposals have hunkered down, complaining, rightly, that news accounts have often oversimplified their ideas. Several declined to be interviewed. At a recent seminar one of the authors, Xu Weihua of the All-China Women's Federation said, ""Divorce is too easy under the existing marriage law, and women's rights have not been protected so many have become single mothers and poor."" Other drafters such as Wu Changzhen, a professor at Beijing's University of Politics and Law, have said that while they are not against divorce as such, there are too many ""rash divorces,"" and that people who violate the marital contract through adultery ought to pay -- usually in the form of extra money to the spouse in a divorce settlement. The opponents say that a rise in divorces in China is not necessarily unhealthy; the current rate of 12 divorces for every 100 marriages remains far below that in most Western countries. These opponents support strong rules on sharing of property and child support after divorce, but say that does not warrant the punitive spirit of the proposals. When legislators first considered the matter a couple of years ago, it seemed clear that the country's 1980 marriage law needed updating. That law allowed relatively free divorce in principle, with ""alienation of affection"" as possible grounds, although splitting up has long been difficult in practice because of the scarcity of housing. But the law was generally too vague and sparse to deal with China's new complexities. The National People's Congress appointed a panel of senior legal experts to come up with a proposal. Late last year, as a secret draft circulated, a number of concerned sociologists and family experts convened a meeting -- including the draft's authors -- to discuss it. Then this August, a detailed account of that meeting was published in a popular Beijing newspaper. The topic clearly touched a nerve and the media have been given a long leash to explore the issues, often carrying heavy criticism of the new proposals. But one magazine carried an open letter from women whose husbands had affairs who said they wished to ""vigorously call for adultery to be made unlawful."" The proposed new divorce law would not, as has been reported here to great alarm, limit divorce only to cases in which couples have lived apart for three years. Numerous other causes such as adultery, one party's alcoholism or spousal abuse can also be grounds. It is not even clear that, in practice, it would that much harder to obtain a divorce. But the opponents are reacting in part to the language, which seems to require evidence of wrongdoing. ""We feel that some members of the legal establishment are patronizing people, treating them like children,"" said Chen Xinxin, deputy secretary of the China Marriage and Family Research Institute, a professional association. Most feared is the suggested involvement of the police in adultery cases. If one party violates the duty to be faithful, says a draft, then the other party may call in law enforcement agencies to investigate and end the problem. ""If this becomes law, people will have no sense of security in their private lives,"" Ms. Chen said. ""There will be opportunities for blackmail and extortion."" The unusual debate itself has given Chinese a vivid glimpse at democratic discourse. ""I feel this debate is not simply about the particular issues,"" Ms. Chen said. ""It's also about how to deal with the thousands of years of tradition we have in China,"" she said, ""a tradition of intolerance and lack of respect for individual freedom.""",1998,"China"

"83","Rural Women Stage Innovative Protest for Equality","Asia","The middle-aged farming women forming a human pyramid in front of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government headquarters in Hangzhou last week constituted a small protest that pointed to a big problem: persistent economic and political discrimination against women in rural China, they said. More specifically, said one of the women, who were from the prosperous provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, they were being denied titles to land and housing and, often, financial compensation for land taken by the state for development. ""The state compensates the men, but not the women,"" one of the protesters from Jiangsu, surnamed Shan, said by telephone from Hangzhou. Traditionally in rural China, women ""marry out"" of their native community and move into their husband's household. In the process, many lose their separate legal identity as land and housing are registered under the husband's family. At a time of rapid economic development and urbanization, with governments requisitioning land for new uses, this means women can find themselves shut out of any agreements over compensation. Xi Furong, a Hangzhou lawyer who knows the women and was familiar with their protest, said that several of the women petitioned the government over the issue in the past, to no avail. Hence the unusual, performance-art protest last Thursday. Ms. Shan and the others had covered their heads in blue or cream cloth in a style common in rural areas, but also to obscure their identity. ""There were many more women behind and around us,"" she said. They were protesting not just for themselves, but millions of other rural women, Ms. Xi said. ""It's not that all the women in a village experience this, but every village has women like this,"" said Ms. Xi, singling out issues such as the denial of land rights to women by male officials or family members. Chinese law protects the principles of gender equality and a woman's right to inheritance and land, but in practice these may be flouted, she said. The women said they staged their performance protest at four locations in Hangzhou: the government headquarters, the provincial People's Congress, the High Court and the West Lake, a tourist attraction. Security officers interfered at only one of the venues, they said, questioning them. In recent years, young, highly educated women in China's big cities have held many performance-style protests against an array of issues including a shortage of public toilets for women, gynecological examinations for female civil servant candidates, domestic violence and rules requiring higher examination scores for women than for men to enter certain university courses. An artistic twist may deflect a heavy-handed government response, though the protests are still sometimes broken up. In the Hangzhou protests, banners draped on the women's bodies made their concerns clear. ""The tyranny of valuing men highly and women lightly,"" the slogan on one banner read. ""Married-out women are like thrown-out water,"" read another. According to a 17-province survey carried out in 2011 by , the Seattle-based rural development institute, with China Renmin University and Michigan State University, ""Women's names are not generally listed on land documents."" There are two kinds of land rights documents, the report said: contracts and land rights certificates. As of 2011, ""only 17.1 percent of the existing contracts and 38.2 percent of the existing certificates include women's names, a substantial defect considering that women are legally guaranteed land rights equal to those of men,"" the report said.",2013,"China"

"86","Demanding Toilet Justice for the Women of China","Asia","The battle for bathroom justice for Chinese women took on new life on Wednesday, as activists rallied across the country to demand that the government mandate that more women's toilets be made available. The campaign was part of World Toilet Day, which seeks to raise international awareness about insufficient access to sanitation.  To mark the day, a group of 23 Chinese students, architects and engineers petitioned the government to revise its 2013 Standard for City Public Toilet Design, a draft legislation that calls for 1.5 women's toilets for every men's toilet. The petitioners want that ratio raised to two-to-one, and they want more space in individual stalls in women's restrooms. ""This was the minimum request of 'Occupy Men's Rooms',"" said Li Tingting, who initiated this year's petition, referring to a 2012 campaign calling for more women's toilets in Chinese cities. ""We hope the relevant departments can improve the legislation as soon as possible, and resolve the difficulties women face in going to the bathroom."" The petitioners, who included men, called on the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and other departments to take into account the physiology of women - which they say means that women spend an average of 89 seconds on each bathroom visit, compared with 39 seconds for men - and the fact that some women accompany their children to the restroom. Moreover, the petition said, citing a study by Cornell University, pregnant women and menstruating women have to visit the bathroom for a significantly longer time. Citing Taiwan, Shanghai and Beijing, the petition argued that gender equality on access to toilets was already accepted practice in some facilities in major localities. In Taiwan, the letter said, the 2006 Architectural Technique Regulation requires public bathrooms in vehicle rest areas, schools and movie theaters to use a three-to-one ratio of toilets for to male toilets. female-to-male toilet ratio. In Shanghai, the World Expo in 2010 used a ratio of 2.5 to one in setting up new bathrooms. And in 2008, when Beijing hosted the Olympics Games, the 60 temporary toilets set up at the Temple of Heaven, a popular tourist destination in southeastern Beijing, used a ratio of four to one. ""In my own work, I always use a two to one ratio to design women's and men's bathrooms, because as a woman I feel that the current system is clearly not reasonable,"" said Feng Bifeng, an engineer and one of the petitioners. ""In the women's toilets, you always have traffic. Changing the bathroom ratio is the only way society can show concern for women."" The petitioners' call for toilet justice quickly attracted a following on Sina Weibo, the microblogging service. ""You have to wait forever in line in a women's toilet. I occasionally use the men's toilet for a quick fix!"" one user admitted. This year's initiative may have lacked some of the color of the Occupy Men's Bathroom campaign in 2012, which featured protesters showing up at Guangzhou's government offices, chanting, ""Bathroom ratio two to one, or else women won't hold it!"" But Ms. Li, who started Wednesday's petition, noted that this year, photos of supporters across China holding signs reading ""2:1"" were posted online. ""I've been paying attention to this toilet issue for years, and feel there aren't enough people paying attention to it in China,"" she said in an interview on Tuesday. ""So I often think, if not me, who?"" She threatened further action if the government did not respond to the petitioners' satisfaction. ""If Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen don't build more women's toilets and fix their ratio, I'll wear short pants and roll around in Yuexiu Park"" she said, referring to an area in Guangzhou. ""The situation is too nerve-racking,"" Ms. Li said. ""The government hasn't taken any action on this. It's enough to make one roll in circles.""",2014,"China"
"87","EXPORT BRIDES BIG BUSINESS IN PHILIPPINES","Asia","More than 3,000 Philippine women became export brides of Australians and West Germans last year, and 4,000 others went to other European countries and the United States. Groups of men on bride-hunting tours here conduct interviews arranged by introduction services. A marriage can take place within the week, but visas for the brides may take up to six months. ''Filipinas are more understanding,'' said Basil Barrington, an Australian who found his wife on a bride-hunting trip a year ago and married her last week. ''They are more willing to accept a man for what he is.'' The personal columns in Manila newspapers contain ads from men all over the world looking for brides, and dozens of agencies and recruiters have set up business in the last few years since the troop withdrawals following the Vietnam war reduced the opportunities for Philippine women to meet Western men. American Husbands Preferred ''Foreign citizenship also entitles them to bring their family out of the Philippines one by one,'' said Howard Dexter, who calls himself a freelance recruiter for two Australian publications that advertise brides. ''Most of the women would prefer American husbands, but they will take Australians, Germans, probably any white male from anywhere.'' Though most of the recruiters and matchmakers here are probably legitimate, there are many that are fronts for prostitution. Many women who have left the country believing they were going to a home have found themselves in bars and brothels. ''Matchmaking might be all right for intelligent, consenting adults,'' said Emelina Garcia of the National Commission on the Role of Philippine Women. ''But what about those who are not aware of the tricks, those whose poverty, for instance, makes marriage with a foreigner all that much more irresistible? It simply opens them to exploitation.'' Recruiting practices in recent months have become more bold. A recent plan denounced by women's groups here called for the recruitment of Philippine women for men in West Germany. A woman would be taken to West Germany, all expenses paid, and if she married in 90 days the trip would be free. Otherwise she might be asked to pay for part of it. If she did not marry, she would be returned to the Philippines. Methods Are Denounced The supermarket approach to marriage prompted the Women's Rights Movement of the Philippines to issue a statement denouncing the methods used to find marriage partners. Finding a partner, the women said, ''is a deeply sensitive, intimate matter that cannot be the subject of commerce, industry negotiation or investment.'' But it is a good business. Although the women usually pay nothing, a man can expect to pay a couple hundred dollars for membership in an introduction service and perhaps several thousand for a bridehunting trip. The application form at Vicki Enovesco's introduction service asks a woman her age, height, weight and measurements, whether she likes to cook and do housework and whether she wants to have children of her own or would accept someone else's. The form asks for ''one or two clear photographs of yourself.'' In time the applicant may get a letter from some of the 2,000 men who are members of the service, and eventually she may find a husband. If so, she will be lucky. There are 3,000 Philippine women who are waiting.",1982,"Philippines"

Many of the countries with no female representation often attack, with justice, South African apartheid as a violation of the U.N.  human-rights charter, but their own exclusions of half their populations from participation in sports are similar violations.

"89","JAPAN'S WOMEN WIN SCUFFLE IN EQUALITY WAR","Asia","Equal employment rights for women, at least in theory, came to Japan today, but some people wondered whether this resolutely male-oriented society would even notice. Of the major industrial countries, Japan has been among the more resolute in keeping its men on the job and its women within reasonable proximity of the kitchen. After seven years of public debate and behind-the-scenes compromise, the Parliament gave final approval this afternoon to a bill encouraging employers, beginning next April, to end discrimination on the basis of sex in their hiring, assignment and promotion policies. Severe restrictions now placed on overtime and late-night work by women would be ended in many jobs. These limitations were sometimes characterized as privileges by people who wanted to retain them. But they have had the effect of keeping women out of many jobs. From now on, to cite one possibility, more women may wind up driving taxicabs because they will be permitted to work the lucrative post-10 P.M. shifts legally denied them thus far. Other beneficiaries should be women in executive positions that demand long hours. Perhaps the most notable aspect of Japan's Equal Employment Bill, however, is that it has managed to please almost no one. Women's groups are unhappy because, they say, the law is toothless. It merely requires employers to ''endeavor'' to achieve equality, with no penalties if they do not bother. Business groups are unhappy because, they say, the law threatens employment practices that they regard as part of the Japanese way of life. The changes, they contend, have come too fast. Labor groups are unhappy because, they say, the old work restrictions were good. They argue that for every female corporate manager who benefits from no longer being confined to a legal maximum of six overtime hours a week, there will be many working-class women who suffer under the burden of enforced extra labor. Even now employers often ignore the six-hour limit. Even the bill's supporters have complaints, including its chief lobbyist, the director general of the women's bureau in the Labor Ministry, Ryoko Akamatsu. ''I'm not 100 percent satified,'' she acknowledged. ''But it was so difficult, after so long a discussion. I think this law is necessary, so in that sense it's almost satisfying.'' The point, Mrs. Akamatsu said, is that the Parliament got around to adopting a law of any kind. International Pressure Both in and out of Government, there is a widely held suspicion that the bill would still be sitting in parliamentary committee were Japan not both self-conscious about its international reputation and under time pressure. The United Nations ''Decade For Women'' ends this summer, which is the deadline for ratifying a convention banning sexual discrimination. To ratify it, and thus to gain approval overseas, Japan first needed a law like the one enacted today. Although career prospects for Japanese women may be far less bright than those in the United States, they are not entirely hopeless. A growing number of women have attained high-level corporate positions that would have been unthinkable for them a few years ago. But they remain exceptions underlining the rule that in most Japanese offices women fill lower-ranking jobs offering few chances for promotion. A young Government employee who took part months ago in a protest demonstration outside the Labor Ministry building in Tokyo said she became aware that she had been relegated to inferior status the first time she had to pour tea for male colleagues. ''I realized that serving them tea was an extra requirement on top of my normal chores,'' she said. #6 Percent of Managers Women make up 35 percent of the Japanese work force, but only 6 percent of the managers. Over all, their salaries are slightly less than 50 percent of those paid to men. At least 80 percent of all companies, according to Government studies, have one or more job categories for which women may not apply. In that regard, the Government does little better. Women are all but invisible in the upper echelons of the bureaucracy. At a local level, in 1982 there were 70,084 positions in prefectural, municipal and village assemblies. Women held 796 of those, or only 1.1 percent. It is generally assumed that women will work for a few years as ''office ladies'' - the English term has entered the Japanese language - then marry and raise families. This attitude is held not only by men but, judging from numerous opinion polls, most women as well. ''Legislation itself won't help,'' Akiko Santo, a Member of Parliament's Upper House, told the Japanese news agency Kyodo. ''Working women must themselves enhance their consciousness toward work.'' Mrs. Santo has an echo in the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, which said today that it would follow the spirit of the new law even though it has resisted it for years. The federation's director for personnel management, Hiroshi Kitamura, contends that Japan's much-vaunted system of ''lifetime employment'' is threatened because women will be given equal treatment even though there are no guarantees that they will not quit after a few years. Will the New Law Work?  That situation, however, is changing, albeit slowly. Last year, for the first time, more than half of all married women held jobs, and the share is expected to increase as a result of Japan's low birth rate and the spread of labor-saving devices. There simply are many more young, highly educated married women with free time than before. Whether the new law speeds their gains is uncertain. The Labor Ministry intends to draw up guidelines to let employers know what specific actions will be expected of them starting next April. Among the practices likely to end are want ads stressing male or female applicants only and policies such as earlier mandatory retirement ages for women than for men. While the law lacks penalties, the Government can apply considerable pressure. In a consensus-forming, controversy-shunning society like Japan, Government jawboning could be an effective tool, Mrs. Akamatsu of the Labor Ministry argued. ''If a company is concerned about its prestige,'' she said, ''it will abolish the kind of discrimination we are talking about.''",1985,"Japan"
"90","DISPUTE OVER A MOSLEM DIVORCE ENSNARLS GANDHI","Asia","She was cast aside by her husband after 43 years of marriage, a not uncommon occurrence in much of the world. But Shah Bano reacted differently for an Indian woman, especially for a Moslem woman. She went to court to demand money from the man who divorced her. It took 10 years for the case to reach the Indian Supreme Court, which last year awarded Shah Bano a $40 monthly maintenance fee to be paid by her former husband, a well-to-do lawyer in the city of Indore. Then the furor began. In noisy demonstrations across India, angry Moslems have been protesting the Shah Bano decision as an unwarranted intrusion into their religious affairs. Divorce and divorce settlements, the protesters say, are matters of Moslem personal law, out of the range of civil courts. Such laws do not require payments from former husbands when marriages dissolve, they say. An Imam's Outrage ''We don't recognize this decision,'' said Syed Abdullah Bukhari, the Imam of Jama Masjid, India's largest mosque, in the heart of Old Delhi. ''We will not accept such a direct interference with Moslem personal law.'' To the people who favor overturning the Shah Bano decision, an important aspect of India's identity is at stake. This is the India of diverse religions and cultures that holds itself together because it respects the practices of its minorities. Pitted against this group are those who see India as a progressive, secular nation with uniform laws and universal rights. ''It is a dangerous trend when a minority community says it should be exempted from a Supreme Court judgment because of religion,'' said Subhadra Butalia, a leading feminist writer and lawyer. ''A woman's right to claim redress before a court of law should not be compromised.'' It is estimated that there are 75 million Moslems in India, which is a little more than 10 percent of the population. But the case is more than a new source of grievance from India's largest religious minority or even a new cause celebre for feminists. In recent weeks, it has become a vexing political quandary for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, an apostle of secularism but a politician worried about losses among his Moslem constituents. Mr. Gandhi has been meeting with feminist and Moslem leaders in his own party to sort out the issue. His aides are known to be worried about a recent trend in which Moslem voters have been abandoning their longtime support for the ruling Congress Party. The Moslem defections were hastened by Mr. Gandhi's negotiation of a settlement last year with the leaders of the troubled northeastern state of Assam. The Prime Minister agreed to the disenfranchisement or expulsion of millions of Moslems who had illegally moved to Assam from nearby Bangladesh. The accord infuriated Moslem leaders. They organized their own political party and in December helped hand Mr. Gandhi's party one of its worst electoral defeats in years. Shaken by the results, the Prime Minister's aides fear that Shah Bano has created a genuine crisis. Politicians who have met with Mr. Gandhi say he will probably support legislation to reverse the effects of the Shah Bano decision. But feminists have served notice that if this happens, his party will ''forfeit its claim to represent women,'' as one leader put it. In fact, Moslems in the Congress Party are themselves divided over the case, although those who want the Prime Minister to stand by the Shah Bano decision acknowledge they are in the minority in their communities. Mr. Gandhi reportedly exhorted a group of feminists not to impose ''Western perceptions'' on others. ''He is very concerned that a Government decision should not start communal bloodshed,'' said Mrs. Butalia, who was among those who met with Mr. Gandhi. Plaintiff to Drop Claim Shah Bano herself, meanwhile, has clouded the issue by announcing her intention to drop her claim, saying she was unaware that it violated religious tenets. ''I am an illiterate old woman, so how was I to know all this?'' she said at a news conference in December. But her case is still on the books, and there has already been a proliferation of court orders for maintenance payments in conformance with it. The legal basis of the decision is ambiguous, making it all the more controversial. A section of the national criminal code clearly permits a judge to order payment of a maintenance fee to an impoverished divorced woman. But some years ago the criminal code was amended to exempt any claim if the woman had already received what she was due ''under any customary or personal law applicable to the parties.'' Moslems say Shah Bano did receive a lump-sum payment upon the divorce, and that Moslem law clearly says a divorced woman's maintenance is to be paid by her own immediate family or the community at large, not by her ex-husband. In his decision, the Supreme Court's Chief Justice, Y. V. Chandrachud, who has since retired, started further controversy because, in effect, ruled that a maintenance payment was permissible under Moslem personal law. The idea of a Hindu judge ruling on what is permissible in Moslem law was especially galling to Moslem clergymen. So was the judge's larger suggestion that the nation adopt a clear and uniform code for everyone.",1986,"India"
"91","SEOUL JOURNAL; DEFINING KITH AND KIN IN THE LAND OF KIM AND LEE","Asia","Once, not so long ago, a young man named Soh fell in love with a young woman whose family name also happened to be Soh. At first they thought little of the coincidence, a routine occurrence in a country that by official count has only 249 surnames. People named Kim alone account for 20 percent of the 41 million South Koreans. Add in Lee, Park, Choi and Chung and you have about 55 percent of the population. Unhappily for the Sohs, an inspection of their family registers revealed that they shared a common ancestor. Both traced their lineage to a Soh who had lived - 30 generations ago - in the southern town of Talsong. The young lovers might as well have been brother and sister. Under South Korea's Family Law, which bans marriage between men and women with both the same name and the same ancestral village, their relationship was considered incestuous. Law Is Sometimes Winked At Despite the prohibition, the Sohs were wed in a civil ceremony. They benefited from the fact that a few judges and priests wink at the law, which is rooted in ancient custom but has been on the books only since 1958. The young couple could not legally register their marriage, however. Technically, the two children who came later were illegitimate, and, as a result, ran a risk of not being allowed to enroll in public school. Finally, the Sohs decided they had had enough of the social dislocation and emigrated five years ago to the United States. Few South Koreans have been driven so far by this problem. But experts say that thousands of families live in the same legal twilight, and their plight has touched off an aggressive campaign for change. No matter what value it may have once had to discourage inbreeding in tiny villages, critics say, it has long dissolved into an anachronism. Feminists in particular have made this an issue because only paternal lineage counts in tracing one's roots. A couple can be as close as first cousins once removed on the mother's side without legal worry. Incest on the Mother's Side ''Why is it O.K. to be incestuous on the mother's side?'' said Lee Tai Young, a lawyer and one of South Korea's most prominent women. ''There is absolutely no value in retaining this law.'' But formidable resistance to change comes from South Korea's 800,000 Confucians. Upholders of a venerable ethical code, they are a diminished presence in modern Korea, but they still hold sway in rural areas and can be a strong political influence. Thousands of Confucians, many of them long-bearded elders in traditional clothes, rallied recently at the National Assembly in Seoul and warned that they would fight to the death to keep the law intact. ''The mood among some Confucians is that they would commit suicide, if necessary,'' said Choi Keun Duk, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University, a Confucian academy in Seoul. He himself would not go to that extreme, Professor Choi said, but he understood the intense emotions. Remnant of a Tradition ''Since Western culture has flowed into Korea, a substantial portion of our own has disappeared,'' he said. ''The only legacy is the Family Law. Abolishing it would bring about the entire collapse of Korean traditional culture.'' For many South Koreans the dispute is a paradigm of the difficult adjustments they have had to make since the end of the Korean War 34 years ago. In almost no time, they transformed themselves from a tattered, agricultural society to a muscular industrial force, a city-based nation where one of every four people lives in Seoul alone. ''The change has been too rapid for many Koreans,'' said Lee Kwang Kyu, an anthropology professor at Seoul National University. ''Most of these kinds of problems come from younger persons - urban dwellers with weak family ties, or none at all.'' Some things, though, stay the same. Through obligatory family registers, a Kim from the village of Chongju can tell right away whether another person is also a Chongju Kim - and off limits - or a Kim from any of 300 other known points of origin, and thus safe. So strong is the tradition that some people who regard the Family Law as outmoded say they nonetheless could not imagine violating the marital taboo. Men Are Heavily Favored The proposed changes in the statute involve an array of issues, including inheritance rights, divorce codes and head-of-household privileges, all now heavily weighted in favor of men and against women. But the marriage provision is the real sticking point, and it is the one that stirs passions. ''From this law comes all discrimination in this society,'' Lee Tai Young said. ''People learn discrimination in the home - men against women, first son against second son, father against mother. This is the original trouble-maker.'' Professor Choi insists it is not a question of bias, although some Confucians do say openly that they regard women as inferior to men. Rather, he said, ''there is simply a distinction made between husband and wife.'' Lawmakers seeking change, who include members of both the ruling and opposition parties, would redefine permissible marriages on the basis of a unit for measuring relationships known in Korean as chon. The word defies adequate translation. How to Measure Kinship Between a parent and child there is a distance of one chon, between siblings two chon. An uncle is therefore a three-chon relative. Kim Yung Chung, a National Assemblywoman leading the campaign for revision, would like to ban marriages only within an eight-chon relationship, equivalent to third cousins. But in the interest of compromise, she says she would go as far as 12 chon, or fifth cousins. Even that is too close for the Confucians. For the immediate future, no one expects significant legislative action, and Professor Choi predicts change will never occur. Assemblywoman Kim, points out, though, that the more outspoken Confucians are far along in years and that adjustments may be only a matter of time. ''We know how difficult it is to change ways of thinking,'' she said. ''Customs should survive, just not in the law.''",1987,"South Korea"
"92","Pakistani Women Take Lead In Drive Against Islamization","Asia","A judicial panel of Islamic scholars heard arguments last week about Pakistani laws that accord the legal testimony of women half the weight of the testimony of men. A Moslem clergman at the hearing asserted that women were emotional and irritable, with inferior faculties of reason and memory. He said courts were justified in discounting their testimony along with that of ''the blind, handicapped, lunatics and children.'' Several women's groups countered that Islamic scriptures are filled with instances of respect for the testimony of women. The Islamic scholars' panel, known as the Sharia Court, has yet to rule on the women's challenge to the laws governing testimony and evidence, enacted a few years ago in a drive to align Pakistan's statutes with Moslem teachings. Zia's Actions Sharpen Debate Lately, however, the appropriateness of ancient religious beliefs governing a modern society has again become a matter of sharp debate because of actions by President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq. On May 29, General Zia surprised even his closest associates by dissolving the three-year-old elected Government of Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo, charging it with incompetence, corruption and indifference to Islam. General Zia immediately vowed to strengthen his long-cherished Islamization program, which has been applauded by the Moslem clergy but derided by opposition politicians as a cynical pretext for the President's remaining in power. [At first General Zia was not clear about his intentions, but on Wednesday he issued an ordinance authorizing civilian courts to strike down laws inconsistent with Islamic law. To help the civilian judges, General Zia said an Islamic adviser, or mufti, would be assigned to each courtroom. But it was unclear whether this step would undercut the right of an elected Parliament to make a final decision on the legal system.] More than 90 percent of the country's people are Moslems, but many Pakistanis feel the country has always had a strong secular orientation. 'Program Is Basically a Sham' ''The Islamization program is basically a sham,'' said Amna Piracha, a prominent lawyer in Islamabad. ''But the issue is more than just women's rights. The issue is whether Pakistan is to be governed by elected representatives of the people or a group of clergymen answerable to no one.'' Despite enormous difficulties in an Islamic country, a small group of women's organizations have held demonstrations and submitted petitions against Islamic measures in the past, and they are planning more protests to try to head off or at least water down the new steps. The women's groups note that in the last three years, the elected Parliament - almost entirely male and dominated by General Zia's supporters - could not muster the votes for the legislation that the President now seems to want to put through by fiat. General Zia has promised new elections in 90 days but still has not set a date. 'Alarm and Resentment' This week, the Islamabad chapter of the Women's Action Forum, a small group of professional women, expressed ''alarm and resentment'' at what they charged was ''a back-door attempt to introduce a particularly anti-female bias into the law of the land during the present political vacuum.'' Indeed, Iqbal Ahmed Khan, a former Law Minister under Mr. Junejo, said the Government had tried hard to win backing for a measure favored by General Zia that would have permitted a high-level tribunal of Islamic clergymen to throw out family laws protecting women's rights. The family laws, enacted in the 1960's, bar childhood and teen-age marriages and make it more difficult for a man to divorce his wife arbitrarily or to acquire a second wife. Both Pakistan's clergy and the Islamic Party, the country's most powerful religious-oriented political organization, had also backed the legislation and even won a promise from Prime Minister Junejo to push it through. They contend that only Islam can govern such family practices as divorce and polygamy. The latest steps do not in themselves dictate a subordinate role for women, and they would not prevent Benazir Bhutto, the most popular Pakistani opposition leader, from campaigning for office. But politicians agree that the issue is a sensitive and difficult one for her. Miss Bhutto has frequently criticized the Islamization program, but some women's groups say she has shied away from the issue, not wanting to be overly identified as a feminist. Although she is Western-educated, she entered into an arranged marriage last year in keeping with Islamic custom, noting that as a Pakistani woman and a public figure it would be unacceptable for her to date anyone. Others Also Resist Islamization The problem was that women were not the only ones to resist the idea of a court of Islamic scholars having the final say on Pakistan's laws. Mr. Khan said many members of Parliament were also uncomfortable in principle with ceding such authority to the clergy or anyone else. ''We tried to reach a consensus on the bill between the clergy and the women's groups,'' he said. ''We failed in our efforts. You know, women in this country do have equal rights and cannot be ignored.'' The new debate is shadowed by a widespread fear that imposing a uniform Islamic code could deepen divisions and spur violence among Pakistan's various Moslem sects. On the other hand, there is a broadly shared feeling that large parts of Islamization have been little more than cosmetic. For instance, in the years following General Zia's seizure of power in a 1977 coup, much publicity was generated by his proposals for such ''Islamic punishments'' as cutting off the hand. Laws, but No Enforcement The laws went on the books, but no one's hand has been cut off, in part because doctors have refused to perform the operations. One woman convicted of adultery has been sentenced to be stoned, but the case is being appealed and many doubt she will ever be punished. For a time in the 1970's, women in Pakistan's schools and universities were ordered by administrators to cover themselves up, but these practices fell by the wayside. Pakistani professional women say they generally feel able to venture outside without a veil if they wish. Some years back, the Government also imposed a widely applauded Islamic tax on bank deposits for distribution to the poor. But many Pakistanis simply withdraw their savings whenever the tax is collected. The Government also abolished interest payments, but banks pay a ''profit'' to depositors instead. General Zia is widely perceived as a sincerely religious man who has nonetheless used the Islamization drive to cement the political support of both the clergy and the powerful Islamic Party. Thousands of mosques were built, for example, and many clergymen draw Government paychecks. Islamic Party Turns on Zia But the political dynamics of Islamization are changing. The Islamic Party has turned against General Zia, joining in the demand for an elected government and saying it is most unimpressed with his latest professions of love for Islam. Party officials have questioned why he did not enact the desired provisions when he ruled under martial law for eight years before turning the reins over to Prime Minister Junejo and his balky Parliament. Meanwhile, the Islamic Party leader has moved to assure women and other groups that his party does not favor discrimination against women. The laws of evidence according less weight to women's testimony, he said, should be seen in context. ''Those who oppose such laws are only trying to run away from Islam,'' said Qazi Hussain Ahmed, the party leader. ''These laws do not affect women adversely. Our system wants to protect women from unnecessary worry and save them the trouble of appearing in court.''",1988,"Pakistan"
"93","In Pakistan, Women Seek Basic Rights","Asia","Mammuna Khalil adjusted her shawl to cover a little more of her hair and addressed the mosque administrator with a look of determination. Mrs. Khalil, a high school English teacher, wants to come to the mosque to study the Koran, a right she believes is unfairly denied to Pakistani women by conservative religious leaders. ''We send women into politics and into offices and schools,'' she told him. ''Why then do we still approach the mosque in awe and terror?'' The administrator of the mosque, one of Islamabad's most active and progressive, told her that her request was an admirable one but that ''this society in which we live does not yet permit it.'' Mrs. Khalil was offered a tape recording of the sermons of the Islamic scholar whose teachings she had sought. Report Urged Change for Women In 1985, a commission set up by President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq concluded its study of the problems of women in Pakistan with a call for ''a clear policy guaranteeing a dignified and honorable religious and legal status to women.'' Backed by references to the Koran, the Islamic holy book, the commission asked that ''women's high place in society, as granted by Islam, be restored.'' The Zia Government never published the report, which documented abuses from forced child marriage to brutality against women in prison. The Government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the first woman to head a modern Islamic nation, has announced that it will make the document public, but has not yet done so, though photocopies are circulating among women's rights groups. Nor has the Bhutto Government taken steps, as the report recommended, to repeal what together are called the ''Hadood'' ordinances, governing the giving of evidence in court. Under these 1979 ordinances, women cannot testify in certain kinds of cases, including adultery and theft. In other legal cases, the evidence of two women is necessary to equal that of one man. Critics of Prime Minister Bhutto The Women's Action Forum, an Islamabad organization, is becoming more outspoken in its criticism of Prime Minister Bhutto's record on these issues. Members of the forum say that most women released from prison so far under a pardon for women inmates have been those associated with Ms. Bhutto's governing People's Party. Action on women's issues would be very difficult for Ms. Bhutto, her supporters say. Her Government does not command the two-thirds majority in Parliament necessary to repeal some of the laws felt to be discriminatory. In the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, as in many Islamic nations in the developing world, the condition of women often derives as much from economic convenience and the practices of tribal, desert or frontier societies as from religion. Comparison to India Nighat Khan, the director of Behbud, a private women's welfare organization based in Rawalpindi, said that in Pakistan women have been conditioned to defer to men and boys, to give them the best morsels of food, to abide by their decisions. Mrs. Khan, who was born in India, organizes vocational training and scholarship programs for women and helps them get loans to start small businesses - among these selling cosmetics, underwear and other personal items to women who rarely, if ever, venture into public to shop. As she was talking to a reporter, Mrs. Khan was interrupted by a frantic volunteer who wanted legal help in getting a mastectomy for a woman with cancer whose husband had refused permission for the operation, even though he understood she would die without it. Mrs. Khan, who considers herself less radical than some of her fellow women's rights advocates, says men in Pakistan are not so bad. In contrast to India, where female infanticide is a persistent occurrence, she said, ''I have never heard of a father ill-treating or killing a baby girl in Pakistan.''",1989,"Pakistan"
"94","What's in a Japanese Name? For Many Women, Obscurity","Asia","Reiko Sekiguchi is the name she was given at birth, and that is how she is addressed at social gatherings and scholarly conferences, on research papers, even on letters from her husband. But on the campus of Toshokan Joho University, Ms. Sekiguchi is listed under a name that none of her colleagues and friends even recognize -her married name. The university says it has no choice, because Japanese law requires married couples to use the same name, and a Government-financed institution must use only her legal, married name. Ms. Sekiguchi says that is unfair, and is suing the Government and her university in the first challenge to a nearly century-old law. Ms. Sekiguchi's lawsuit is prompting debate on a practice that most Japanese couples have taken for granted. This summer, a group of 30 women in Tokyo formed an association to lobby the Justice Ministry to change the law. About 500 women across Japan have now joined groups opposing the law. A group within the Japan Bar Association has issued a handbook for women who do not want to use their husbands' names. Even some newspapers have suggested that the law might be outdated in a country where more than half of married women work, and where women make up nearly 37 percent of the work force. ''Take the case of a woman who works using her maiden name, establishes a good record and becomes well-known under this name,'' a columnist in the daily Asahi Shimbun wrote recently. ''If she marries and changes her surname, confusion arises. Is the law in line with the realities of society?'' Article 750 of Japan's Civil Code requires married couples to use one surname - either that of the husband or the wife. According to Government statistics, 97.8 percent of couples choose the husband's name. Newly married couples must then list their names in a separate family register. The name in the register, or koseki, is the couple's legal name, although some women like Ms. Sekiguchi have continued to use their own names in their daily lives. Ms. Sekiguchi's case shows how complicated that choice can be. Her running battle with university officials has reached levels of pettiness unusual even in this bureaucratic, by-the-rulebook society. When she applies for leave to attend research conferences, she must do so in her married name. When she arrives at the conference, she uses her own name, the one listed on her thesis and research papers. ''It's so much trouble, because when the university people want to find me when I am outside, there are two names, and it gets very complicated,'' said Ms. Sekiguchi, who is 51 years old and has been married for 23 years. She said she has had no trouble using her own name at the other universities where she has studied and taught. The Two-Pronged Approach University officials say they offered to let Ms. Sekiguchi list both her own and married names in the faculty directory, but she refused. ''When her status is a researcher, we allow her to use her maiden name, because building a reputation for work is critical,'' said Masanobu Fujikawa, the president of Toshokan Joho University, in the city of Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. ''But for official purposes, including the curriculum and faculty directories, the law does not allow us to accept usage of the maiden name.'' When Ms. Sekiguchi applied for a grant to help pay her research assistants' salaries, the university turned it down because she applied in her own name. ''The money we have to pay is public money and we can't pay it to a person whose name is not on our official personnel directory,'' Mr. Fujikawa said. Keiko Fukuzawa, a journalist active in the campaign opposing the law, said she now finds several of her married friends regret taking their husbands' names, either because they feel they have lost their own identity or because they feel taking a new name makes them subservient to their husband's family. By taking a new surname, women in Japan are usually considered to have left their own family and joined their husband's. 'Voices Have Been Raised' A group of women opposed to the law recently visited the Justice Ministry to press for changes. ''We realize that voices have been raised,'' said Tamio Okamitsu, a counselor at the Justice Ministry's Civil Law bureau. ''I understand that inconveniences are occurring. But since this would greatly affect national life, we have to consider carefully all possible ramifications.'' Mr. Okamitsu said many Japanese worry about what would happen if children had different names than the father or mother. Indeed, many Japanese still have reservations about changing the system. Ms. Sekiguchi and Ms. Fukuzawa have begun conducting separate surveys on the law. They are finding that while unmarried women often want to change their names, once they marry, many change their minds later. ''Many women have the fantasy that changing their names means happiness and care from their husbands,'' Ms. Fukuzawa said. ''But while some are satisfied, others found they were losing their identity and regretted it.'' Ms. Fukuzawa has applied her principles to her own household. She asked her husband to take her name on the family register. He did so, keeping his own name at work. But as a journalist, he has to travel outside Japan, and he found that he would have to use his wife's name on his passport. The two decided to file a paper divorce, which means neither will be able to inherit the other's assets without paying gift taxes. But Ms. Fukuzawa, who is 30 years old, says she does not care, because neither has much to leave the other.",1989,"Japan"
"95","AS PAKISTAN 'ISLAMIZES,' FEMINISTS RISE UP IN ANGER","Asia","President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq recently gave a dinner party in Lahore for several hundred architects and their wives who had assembled from all over the world for an award ceremony. When the guests arrived at the magnificent home of the Punjabi governor, where the dinner was held, the women were unceremoniously separated from the men and required to eat by themselves. The women, Pakistanis as well as foreign quests, were quick to express their displeasure. So much so that the governor, who had been greeting the guests, turned to two of his aides, pointed to three or four angry women confronting him and said: ''Get these women out of here!'' The unexpected segregation was yet another step toward what has been called the Islamization of Pakistan, a process that many feminists here predict will set back, if not destroy, the cause of women's rights in this traditionally male-dominated Moslem country.  ''There is a strong ongoing effort to take away what we've won in the last 20 years, which isn't much,'' said Rashida Patel, a feminist and Karachi lawyer. ''But educated women here will not brook any pushing back of any kind.'' Mrs. Patel, who has written a book, ''Women and Law in Pakistan,'' insists that Mohammed, the founder of Islam, demanded equal rights for both sexes and that the severe repression of women that characterized latter-day Islam was and is a distortion of the Prophet's teaching and the Koran. Rumors of a Backward Step Of concern at present is the persistent rumor that the Government plans to repeal what amounts to a bill of rights for Pakistani women, the Family Laws Ordinance of 1961. The Islamic Ideology Council, which has no lawmaking power, has endorsed repeal with but one dissenting vote, that of its lone woman member. Both the Law Ministry and the Religious Affairs Ministry have reportedly recommended repeal. Both ministers have denied this and so has the President. ''One can't be sure,'' said a woman who attended the Lahore dinner. ''It's not difficult to see what direction the conservatives want to take.'' The status of women in Pakistan is deplorable, feminists here say.  Only 20 percent of the population over the age of 10 is literate.  For women the figure is probably less than 10 percent. In rural areas it is less than 5 percent. The average life span of a Pakistani woman is less than 52 years. For men it is 53. A contributing factor may be that Pakistani women average six births. In rural areas and often in city slums, education is reserved for boys. According to recent figures about 75 percent of all boys between the ages of 5 and 9 are enrolled in primary schools, but only 33 percent of the girls in the same age group. ''In the country,'' said Mrs. Patel, ''girls do not go out alone to school.'' Waiting Lists for Girls In the city the situation is reversed: there are not enough schools for girls. There are waiting lists at every educational level. ''At the other end of the scale there are relatively large numbers of women physicians and lawyers,'' Mrs. Patel said. ''Women doctors are important beccause the Moslem women do not like to go to men. Often their husbands won't let them.'' ''In fact,'' she said, ''based on marks, 75 percent of all the places in our medical schools would go to women but it's all done on a quota system.'' There are 10 female civil-court judges in Sind Province, where Karachi is situated. Eight years ago there were none. The family laws ordinance raised the marriage age for women from 14 to 16. Before the 1961 ordinance a man could divorce his wife simply by pronouncing the word for divorce three times. Divorce without the consent of both spouses is still possible, but under the family laws ordinance there must be a three-month effort at reconciliation with the help of an arbitration council designated by civil authorities. The 1961 law also tightened the regulations governing polygamy.  Originally in Islamic society a man was allowed four wives. As late as 1956 an attempt to legislate the maximum number of wives was shelved as unpopular, but the 1961 ordinance did make it much more difficult to contract marriages after the first. Before a man can enter into a second or third marriage he must submit an application to an arbitration council stating his reasons for the marriage and indicating whether he has the consent of his current wife or wives. Backlog of Cases in Courts The arbitration councils were dissolved when martial law was declared, but much of their work is performed by the family courts.  Feminists are demanding more such courts, charging that the backlog of divorce and maintenance cases has become almost unmanageable. The feminists are also calling for a clear law against plural marriage. Opposing them are Islamic traditionalists who have been fighting the legal strictures against polygamy since they were adopted 19 years ago. President Zia, who has been in the forefront of a so-called Islamic rebirth, has been ambiguous in his statments about the role of women in a Moslem society. In his speeches he has called for women to ''participate fully'' in the affairs of the nation and has agreed, at least in principle, to carry out a feminist demand for a high-level Government commission on the status of women, something they have sought for 20 years. At the same time it was President Zia who called for separation of the sexes at the Lahore party, and he has endorsed conservatives' demands for new universities exclusively for women.",1980,"Pakistan"
"96","PAKISTAN'S GRIM ISLAMIC LAW IS NOT JUST A THREAT","Asia","An 18-year-old high school student and the 24-year-old school bus driver with whom she eloped were ordered recently to be flogged and then stoned to death for adultery. It was the first such sentence passed by a religious court here since Pakistan adopted traditional punishments for violations of Koranic law more than three years ago. The ruling, announced here Sept. 1, is the most dramatic example of the Government-sponsored attempt to foster standards of probity and private behavior that are defined as Islamic. Most of these efforts center on relations between men and women, and in the last month they have involved decisions to limit or ban female models on television and the cancellation of a foreign trip by a women's field hockey team on the ground that there would be male spectators watching the games. Meanwhile, Government organizations are considering a national standard of dress. Punishment Still in Doubt Whether the young couple here will actually undergo the punishment ordered by the sharia, or religious court, remains in doubt, and like so many of the rulings involving women's rights, the matter is likely to arouse some controversy. Since the Islamic punishments gained Government sanction, none of the harsher penalties has yet been imposed. A few convicted thieves have been sentenced to have their hands cut off but no amputations have been carried out. In fact, as the sentence hangs over the convicts, Government-fi@nanced religious councils remain divided over such technical and sectarian issues as how much of the hand should be severed, should the operation be surgically administered and should the event be televised. Floggings for such offenses as drinking alcoholic beverages, pimping or frequenting brothels are carried out routinely, however.  After the outcry abroad that accompanied the imposition of the initial lashings, these are now administered out of public view in prison compounds. In the case involving the Karachi student, the court found that last winter she had gone to live with the bus driver, who was already married. In issuing information to the press, the court reported that adultery was proven because the woman had become pregnant. She recently gave birth to a daughter who is now being cared for by the bus driver's first wife. Marriage Certificate Disregarded In reaching its judgment, the court disregarded a marriage certificate produced by the couple, saying that the woman was already pregnant at the time of the marriage and that there had been an adulterous relationship. The decision of the religious court, which is subject to appeals for mercy, is likely to shock foreigners. But it is seen here as just another incremental step in the spread of Islamic puritanism, which focuses significantly, though not exclusively, on defining proper roles for women. For example, several weeks ago Zafar ul-Haq, the Minister of Information and Broadcasting, asserted that women were not to be exploited in television commercials or on the radio since ''they occupy a position of respect and sanctity in Islamic society.'' This was widely interpreted as suggesting a ban on the use of women as models in the very prim television advertisements that invariably show modestly dressed matrons in domestic settings. Some officials in the military Government echoed the call and said that stricter standards should be extended to advertisements in the press and to movies. Women's Groups Protest Pakistan's largely middle-class women's organizations responded angrily. Eighteen of the groups hastily convened a meeting and denounced the ministerial sentiment as limiting the opportunities of women in media. Rana Liaquat Ali Khan, the founder of the All-Pakistan Women's Association and the widow of the country's first Prime Minister, wrote to President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq that the implied threat of a ban was ''discriminatory and contrary to fundamental rights of women as equal citizens and full human beings.'' Mr. Zafar, the Information Minister, said in an interview here that he had never intended to ban all women from modeling and that he was interested only in ''banning obscenity.'' He said that the standard for obscenity that he had adopted was anything that ''would cause embarrassment to a family group of a mother, father, sons and daughters watching television together.'' He said that no ads had yet been canceled. However, folk dancing, which in Pakistan is often practiced by men and women dancing separately, is apparantly regarded as lascivious or evocative of lust and cannot now be shown on television. The second recent controversy over norms of modesty involved the projected sending of a team to an Asian women's hockey tournament in Japan. Conflict Over Uniforms A team was selected but then a conflict arose over uniforms. The international hockey organizations authorize short skirts. In Pakistan, women play in the baggy pants suits that in a variety of fabrics and prints are the basic garment for women here. According to one woman involved in the discussions, an agreement was reached to allow the Pakistani women to play in track suits with long pants. At this point, the source reported, some men raised the objection that while women athletes here play on sequestered fields without male spectators, this would not be the case in Japan. Whether this was the critical objection could not be determined, but in any case, no team was sent. Gulzar Bano is the head of the women's division of the President's Secretariat and is the only woman holding Cabinet rank. At her office in Islamabad she declined to discuss matters of dress, which she said deflected attention from the real progress that is being made in the field of women's rights. Miss Bano made it clear that in a society and culture as male-dominated as Pakistan's, confrontational strategies of the kind used in the West could only be counterproductive. Emphasis on Economic Issues ''What we are trying to do is to see that some more resources are allocated to improve the status of women,'' said Miss Bano. ''We have a section of the population whose needs have been arbitrarily neglected and we want to make the invisible visible.'' She explained that the strategic emphasis had been on economic issues, saying that her office battled for more schools, more clinics and more vocational training for women. ''When a woman acquires a skill like carpet-making, her husband will be that much more willing to let her out of the house for the income she can bring,'' said Miss Bano. She said that the prevailing culture of male dominance could change when the economic benefits of such change were made clear to both men and women. Miss Bano, who along with two recently named female ambassadors is among the highest-ranking women in Pakistan's Government, said she felt that there was great confusion in the West over the Islamic view of women. ''Islam preaches equality of men and women and this Government is committed to providing equality of opport unity for all,'' she said.  ''Such things as the favoring of the male children, these are not Islamic but r ather they are cultural traditions of the subcontinent. ''",1981,"Pakistan"
"97","PAST THREATENS THE FUTURE OF INDIAN WOMEN","Asia","According to Manu, the codifier of ancient Hindu law, the proper role of women in society is clearly defined. ''In childhood,'' he wrote, ''she must be subject to her father, in youth to her husband and when her lord is dead, to her sons. A woman must never be independent.'' The 31-year-old Indian constitution reflects a more contemporary view. ''The state,'' it affirms, ''shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste or sex.'' The position of women in India is framed by these contradictory imperatives. The paradoxical consequence is that while the Government is commanded by Indira Gandhi, other women in India are routinely sold into marriage and brothers are almost invariably favored over sisters. India has produced large numbers of women doctors, scientists, engineers and diplomats. Accomplished women, almost always from the upper castes and classes, have from the beginnings of independence played a prominent role in national development. Moreover, in citing the Government's commitment to improving the status of women, officials point to the increasing numbers of women in the civil service which, since British times, has been the effective finishing school for national elites. There are some 250 women holding senior civil service positions, representing 6 percent of such jobs. About 60 percent of these women have entered Government service in the last decade, clearly suggesting a rising trend. But whether increasing numbers of successful and prominent women reflect wider social change is open to question. Suman Krishnan Kant, a feminist leader who heads a group that counsels abused women, says there is virtually no sift down effect from the improving fortunes of women in the civil service. Mrs. Kant believes that affluent women who have succeeded are generally unaware of the real plight of poorer women and have little identification with them. ''They have no idea of the problems of the village folk - the terrorism of drunken husbands or brutal landlords or the starkness of poverty,'' Mrs. Kant said. As director of an organization called the Women's Grievances Group, she daily receives complaints and directs investigations of attacks on women, many of them involving the burning and scalding of brides by in-laws who feel they were shortchanged on dowries. Deep Resistance to Change Mrs. Kant's comments are reinforced by an abundance of physical evidence. All over Delhi, thousands of women carry heavy baskets of brick and mortar at construction sites while their husbands or male relatives collect the wages. India is one of the few countries where the life expectancy of women is lower than that of men. In parts of the country women are sold. There are appreciably fewer girl births registered than boy births, leading some demographers to conclude that sickly girls are given less care than boy babies and are more readily permitted to die. In parts of the country, wives and daughters of lower caste families have been sexually attacked in raids intended to humiliate untouchable communities and keep them in what the dominant castes believe to be their proper place. But if the rise of women in the civil service has had little effect so far on the general condition of women, it is still a significant achievement and is being carried out over stiff culturally based opposition. Former Prime Minister Charan Singh once declared that women should not be assigned to administrative jobs in state governments. Under Mrs. Gandhi's rule no such sentiments are expressed, at least not openly. Furthermore, as sociologists frequently point out, it is in the middle and upper classes that cultural patterns are most likely to be transformed. Inflation has brought about the eager acceptance of twoincome households. And an examination of the weekend matrimonial ads in the newspapers shows that women with jobs or professional skills are becoming much more valued than the ''homely girls'' who in the past commanded good matches because of their training in domestic graces. It is in this context that schools, both elitist and rural, are presenting women doctors, scientists and artists as role models. But given the grip of the traditional views about women, the road towards equality of opportunity is likely to be very long. Nirmala Buch, the head of the women's welfare and development office in the social welfare ministry, concedes that despite Government efforts most women remain unaware of their rights. ''There are facilities for women, but it's a question of getting them to make full use of the opportunities,'' she said. Any breakthrough, she added, will also require ''a big change in the attitude of Indian men,'' who still overwhelmingly regard women through Manu's formula as dutiful daughters, wives or mothers. No one can say whether, in the struggle over the role of women, the precepts of Manu or the dictates of a modern nation state will predominate. The modernists have science, technology and the compulsions of the industrial marketplace on their side. But the laws of Manu have maintained much of Indian society for several thousands of years; independent, democratic India is just 31 years old.",1981,"India"
"98","CONTRASTS EVIDENT IN PARLEY ON SEX","Asia","IT was interesting, but somehow beside the point, the research finding that women in some Western countries were denied rights to sexual pleasure. In India, women are undernourished and uncared for medically, compared with men, said Dr. Grace Hasan, director of the Rural India Health Project. ''Without regular rights, how can women have sexual rights?'' she asked at the World Sexology Conference here. Such contradictions of culture were frequently apparent at the conference earlier this month by the World Association of Sexologists, which drew 600 researchers, therapists and other experts on sex from 30 nations. And in meeting in India for the first time, the specialists selected a country that is filled with sexual contradictions. The civilization that produced the Kama Sutra, perhaps the most famous ancient treatise on erotic pleasure, is today marked by what the experts said were repressive and ignorant attitudes toward sex. Indian sex specialists, whose numbers are small but growing, said most Indians believe fertility problems are almost always the woman's fault, that masturbation leads to impotence, that sexual difficulties can be cured by tonics like lizard oil or asparagus root. Women have more health and nutrition problems than men and baby girls have a higher death rate than baby boys, said Dr. Saroy S. Jha, a Bombay expert on women's health. ''When a male child is born, the family celebrates,'' she said. ''The same is not true for a girl child.'' Links to Population Growth The Indian experts at the conference, doctors, health care officials and social workers, offered glimpses into the links between sex education and the drive to curb population growth. India has had some success in this regard. Its population increases at less than 2 percent a year, less than that of many developing countries, but still too much in the view of experts here and abroad. Dr. Jha said failure to try birth control methods was part of a general ignorance among Indian women about their bodies. She related the excitement shown by 12- and 13-year-old Moslem girls from a Bombay slum who were taken shopping for cloth and thread for a sewing class. ''It was the first freedom they had ever tasted,'' Dr. Jha recalled. ''Within a week they were asking about menstruation and pregnancy, subjects they knew nothing about.'' Many Indians said it was remarkable that India, with its conservative attitudes toward sex and the roles of women, had allowed a conference on sex. ''We have had to be extremely careful and avoid areas that are too controversial,'' said Dr. Mahinder C. Watsa, a Bombay gynecologist and consultant with the Family Planning Association of India. Organizers discouraged showings of explicit films and photographs, and erotic art for women was deemed especially inappropriate. An exception was a well-attended display of ancient sculptures and paintings showing acrobatic couplings, bestiality, orgies, lesbianism and phallus worship. Also available were organized tours of the famous 1,000-year-old erotic sculptures at the Hindu temples at Khajuraho, a one-hour flight from New Delhi. Therapies of the Kama Sutra ''There's so much sexuality in the past, and yet it appears that today's culture is very puritan in a way,'' said Dr. June Machover Reinisch, director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction in Bloomington, Ind. Many Indian specialists saw the conference as a chance to show the world that India was a pioneer in sexology. Dr. Prakash Kothari, president of the Indian Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists, who is a professor of sexual medicine at G.S. Medical College in Bombay, gave a slide show asserting that the Kama Sutra, a collection of Sanskrit aphorisms assembled 1,400 years ago, prefigured many of the sex therapies recommended by William Masters and Virginia Johnson. Dr. Kothari noted that the text recommended that newlyweds abstain from sex their first three nights together so they could get to know each other and reduce anxieties. The text also placed strong emphasis on verbal communication, fantasies and allowing the woman to be aggressive. For the Indian masses today, the conference was told, sex tends to be nasty, brutish and short, and ignorance and sexual anxiety are rampant. Thus the question for many listeners was why things seemed to have changed. Some specialists, including Dr. Kothari, blamed successive conquests by invaders from Persia, and then the British and Queen Victoria. Perhaps more plausibly, others said the Kama Sutra and the erotic sculptures at Hindu temples had always been intended for the elite. ''You really can't say these huge old temples were for the common people, any more than the common people go to Playboy clubs today,'' said Dr. Watsa, the Bombay gynecologist. Differences With the West Often in the conference, it seemed that the delegates from the West and from India were talking past each other. Everyone listened politely to two San Diego specialists' report on homosexual ''marriages.'' But a spirited discussion reportedly erupted later in the women's washroom, and most of the Indian women were said to view homosexuality as a violation of nature. Westerners generally seemed to regard erotic magazines and films as a sign of a healthy sexual attitude. But Indian specialists asserted that the sexual content of movies and popular songs caused an increase in rape and attacks and harassment of women by young men in the cities. When Dr. Frank Sommers, a Toronto psychiatrist, asserted that societies permitting premarital sex tended to be less violent and aggressive, a group of Indian journalists loudly demanded that he explain how that squared with their view that the United States was the greatest menace to world peace today. An Australian gynecologist spoke of difficulties treating a woman seeking advice on contraception so that she could have an affair with a man while not telling her lesbian lover. ''Advanced societies have advanced problems,'' said Dr. Jha. ''Some of these problems in the West are irrelevant to us.'' At the turn of the century, for every 1,000 men in India there were 985 women, she said. Today that figure is 935, proof, she said, that the condition of women was getting worse. India still has dowries, and every day there are so-called ''dowry deaths,'' cases when a married woman is killed by her in-laws for allegedly failing to pay off her dowry. Female infanticide is believed to persist in rural areas. Medical developments designed to help women have other effects, such as the use of amniocentesis to determine the sex of an unborn baby and then have an abortion if the fetus is female. ''I am terribly sorry to say this exists in our country,'' said Dr. Jha. As a result of presentations like this, the conference passed a special resolution condemning suppression of women's rights, sexual and otherwise, and the widespread practice of female circumcision. Conference delegates also called for greater efforts by all countries to promote sex education. ''Many of our young people still believe they won't get pregnant if they use certain sexual positions,'' said Dr. Sarla Mukhi, a family planning counselor.",1985,"India"
"99","LET A FEW FLOWERS BLOOM","Asia","HALLS OF JADE, WALLS OF STONE Women in China Today. By Stacey Peck. Illustrated. 315 pp. New York: Franklin Watts. $15.95. STACEY PECK, a professional interviewer who has worked for the Sunday magazine of The Los Angeles Times, traveled in China for two months in late 1983, recording conversations with Chinese women. As she acknowledges, she lacked the background in Chinese culture and language that would have enabled her to move beyond the official progam arranged for her by her host organization, one of China's major newspapers. The women with whom Mrs. Peck was allowed to meet included a large proportion of officials, model workers and others trusted by the Communist Party. Many of the intellectuals and artists mentioned the foreign studies of their children or their own travels outside of China, usually an indication of privilege or status; the peasants she was taken to see were so well off that her interpreter exclaimed, ''Their living conditions are better than mine!'' Despite its limitations, however, this collection is noteworthy as the largest group of interviews with Chinese women to be published since the Cultural Revolution of 1965-76. In today's more relaxed climate, even what is said to an American stranger in official meetings is frequently interesting. Many of the women speak of the improvement in their lives over those of their mothers and grandmothers before the Communist victory, but their complaints about men who do not share the housework and child rearing, about stereotyped attitudes toward the capabilities and talents of both sexes, and about women's lack of political power will sound quite familiar to Western women. In openly discussing such problems, the women Mrs. Peck interviewed were not departing from the official position of the All-China Women's Federation, a Government organization whose English-language publication, Women of China, often contains even more outspoken statements on the status of women than those included here. Very different in tone are the interviews conducted with Chinese in the United States. A temporary expatriate tells Mrs. Peck, ''You interviewed many women in China, and I don't think they would lie to you but . . . some questions they might not answer at all or just omit certain information.'' One of the best interviews was conducted with a computer scientist in Los Angeles who speaks of claiming her father's corpse after his ''persecution to death'' during the Cultural Revolution: ''At the door to the morgue a policeman said, 'Your father was a reactionary, so you are not allowed to cry when you see him.' Then they took me into the room, and I saw him for the first time since he had been arrested.'' The same woman describes her 10-year marriage to a man from whom she was separated because of their state-assigned jobs, an all too common situation in China: ''We tried very hard to work in the same city so we could live together. But we never could, so he's really a stranger to me. . . . We only saw each other on our twelve-day vacations every year, but I do know he's a nice person and very honest.'' In a final section, Mrs. Peck interviews several of the long-term foreign residents of Peking; she is apparently unaware that the reason they are often unexpectedly disappointing informants has to do with the unusual adaptations they have had to make to survive in China for so many years. Although she does speak with one more recent arrival, it would have been more useful and quite easy, even within the modest framework Mrs. Peck has chosen, to interview a few of the hundreds of Western students who have spent several years at the major universities, many of whom have no language barrier and have formed deep friendships with the Chinese. Their anecdotes might have given a sense of what the women of China would have said in a less official context.",1985,"China"
"100","How Pakistan's Sacred-Law Ordinance Works","Asia","To the Editor: Ann Elizabeth Mayer (''In Pakistan, Primacy of Islamic Law Means Reversal for Women,'' letter, Aug. 14) gives an unnecessarily alarmist view about Islamization measures. The sharia ordinance, contrary to Professor Mayer, will be interpreted by experts in Islamic law trained in and out of the country, acting as ''amicus curiae'' to the courts, and their role will be advisory. Only the superior courts have been empowered to strike down laws that may be in conflict with sacred laws. These courts can act on their own or on a move by an individual, on financial and family law. Pakistan jurists believe the sharia ordinance is not outside the Constitution, and Parliament will have the right to amend, approve or reject it. Finally, in the case of the blind servant girl who was raped by her employers and condemned for fornication after having become pregnant, the judgment was passed by a subordinate court and was duly rejected in the superior court.

"101","In Pakistan, Primacy of Islamic Law Means Reversal for Women","Asia","To the Editor: Charles Kennedy's July 24 letter (''In Pakistan, Islamic Laws Are Applied Without Political Control'') offers a curious attempt to portray the Pakistani legal system as free of archaic, discriminatory features just as President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq's presidential ordinance of June 15 has guaranteed injection into the legal system of reactionary features associated with the most retrograde version of Islamic justice. The ordinance makes Islamic law supreme - as in Iran - so that constitutional provisions are now subordinated to the rules of sharia, Islamic sacred law. Under the ordinance, these rules are henceforth to be interpreted by Islamic clerics - as in Iran - not by lawyers trained along Western lines. From the Iranian experience, this should mean sharp reverses in the progress that Pakistani women have made toward equality. The anticonstitutional features of this ordinance have been denounced by representatives of all segments of Pakistani political opinion. A June 17 statement of the All Parties Conference in Lahore condemned the ordinance as ''a blatant violation of the constitution,'' in conflict with human rights and democratic principles. Mr. Kennedy neglects to note that the evidence act gives judges discretion in deciding whether to impose the discriminatory rules of evidence found in classical sharia. Under the new ordinance, which calls for immediate application of sharia rules, one can anticipate a much wider application of rules that bar or devalue the testimony of women. Even before this change, the impact of sharia evidence rules has been far less innocuous than Mr. Kennedy concedes. In one notorious case, a blind servant girl who had been raped by her employers, and became pregnant, was condemned to the punishment for fornication, a ''hadd'' crime, as specified in the Koran. As a woman, her testimony about the rape was inadmissible in a hadd case, so she was not allowed to testify that her pregnancy resulted from rape, with the result that while she was punished, her rapists went free. Mr. Kennedy is quite right in pointing out that the courts and judiciary in Pakistan have an admirable tradition of integrity and independence. That is precisely why the majority of Pakistanis, unlike Mr. Kennedy, are angry over President Zia's efforts to undermine this tradition and redesign the legal system along Iranian lines.

"102","Islam and Feminism","Asia","As a Moslem feminist, I am appalled at the sheer ludicrousness of the Pakistani government's logic displayed in the Dec. 22 news story ""Islam, Secular Life Pull at Pakistan."" Stating that ""sex mania from the West had corrupted Pakistan's women causing them to lose their minds and seduce men in an accelerating cycle of decadence"" obliterates any claims Islam can make toward rational, enlightened discourse. Further adding to the hypocrisy, the mullah quoted, Razaul Azmi, ""dismissed the sex market across the street as 'wildness' occurring in all Moslem countries,"" thus perpetuating the dismal double standard that has held so many Moslem countries back centuries behind the rest of the world in progressive public policy. Islam has never condoned pornography, and for the mullah to note that ""since Islamic law allows a man to take four wives, he may require some 'help' to please them"" is one of the most pathetic parodies of the Holy Koran that I have ever come across. At first I laughed at the blatantly gender-biased blaming of women for society's problems. However, as a native of neighboring Afghanistan, it struck me how depressing the situation has become for women in Islamic countries. Originally one of the most liberating, empowering religions for women, Islam has been distorted to serve the purposes of men who feel threatened by a global society to which they can no longer relate. By controlling women and children they seek to validate their identity, using Islam as a veil. This is perhaps the greatest sin a Moslem can commit. Poor Benazir Bhutto, she never stood a chance.

"103","The First Arab Democracy","Asia","What person was most directly responsible for the broadest improvement of life for the largest number of women in this century? Douglas MacArthur, whose contribution to the liberalization of Japan should be remembered as America approaches the problems and possibilities of victory in another war. Writing some of Japan's new constitution on a yellow legal pad, MacArthur, as governor of occupied Japan, was in a position and a mood to insist on such radical reforms as the rights of organized labor, schools that taught democracy, abolition of the feudal aristocracy and women's suffrage. Thirty-eight women were in the first Diet elected under the new constitution. William Manchester, MacArthur's biographer, writes that before MacArthur's regency, concubinage and family contract marriages had been legal, women had no political or economic rights, (not even the right to own property), public schools were segregated by sex with girls having a diluted curriculum, and there were no colleges for women. Adultery had been licit for husbands but illicit for wives. The Diet had to choose: punish both or neither. The crime of adultery was abolished. Regarding Iraq, last summer The Wall Street Journal defined the maximalists' war aims: ""a MacArthurian regency in Baghdad."" That seemed then -- and still does -- like overreaching, politically and militarily. But now, with the war going well, we should think somewhat spaciously. Today's talk about the New World Order has, so far, a conspicuous flaw: It stresses order, not freedom. However, the Reagan foreign policy had this premise: Domestic freedom conduces to international order. The idea, which would give needed substance to the Bush policy, was that democracy pacifies nations. Governments bound to popular sentiment will not be warlike. History contains counter-examples (for example, in Europe on the eve of World War I), but the theory is broadly confirmed by experience. Thus, a sensible war aim is a new regime in Iraq. To that end, the United States has put a price on Saddam Hussein's head, a price that rises every time bombs drop another bridge into a river. The price is the potential value of U.S. aid for reconstruction of Iraq's infrastructure. Such aid is unthinkable with Saddam on the scene. Furthermore, the Baath Party, which churned up one Saddam, is a likely source of another one. So Iraq's single-party state must be reformed if Iraq is to be tamed. Iraqis should do this, but the allies can provide incentives by making the ending of sanctions and of the occupation of southern Iraq contingent on the replacement of Saddam's regime. America does not want to take the military measures and pay the political price of a protracted occupation and presence to install a regency or administer anything comparable to the de-Nazification of Germany. But America should keep visible to all Iraqis the cash value to Iraq of a revolution, or at least a coup. And America should be poised to spring to the assistance of democratic elements. Furthermore, Iraq need not be the first place for a healthy infection of popular government in that region. There is always our new-found friend Kuwait. Asked if Kuwait no longer opposes an American presence in peacetime, Kuwait's ambassador here says only, ""I don't think now we are in a position to pronounce on this subject."" Given Kuwait's position -- flat on its back, being resuscitated by American power -- perhaps Kuwait is just short of breath. Perhaps America does not want such a presence on the ground. But it would be nice if Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other states would stop treating the United States as a corrupting influence except when there is dying to be done. Kuwait's ambassador says: ""The U.S. has been in the Gulf now for 40 years."" Yes, afloat, safely offshore, where the contamination of freedom and other American viruses cannot so easily unsettle Arab societies. (When the United States was serving Kuwait during the reflagging exercise of the late 1980s, U.S. military and intelligence units were based on barges.) Secretary of State Baker, asked about the possible democratization of Kuwait, says: ""We know that democracy is the best system,"" but if we were to say ""that the government of Kuwait has to change,"" we would be ""permitting aggression to effect political change, and that would be, I think, a terrible mistake."" How is that again? It would be a victory for Iraq if Kuwait helped pay its debt to our democracy by practicing democracy? Kuwait owes the United States much -- indeed, everything, including its existence. The United States has earned the right strongly to suggest to Kuwait's ruling class that the rules should change. There are 21 Arab nations and not a single Arab democracy. Let us not be rude, but let us say to Kuwait: ""Congratulations! You are going to be the first.""",1991,"Japan"
"104","Women, Fed Up and Fighting Back","Asia","Just before dusk on an evening last autumn, an angry mob of women stormed the village liquor shop here, drained gallons of booze into the dusty streets and shaved the heads of drunken men who were lounging at the bar. In hundreds of market towns and farm villages across southeastern India, bands of determined women have hijacked alcohol delivery trucks, set liquor shops ablaze and paraded humiliated liquor merchants down village streets atop donkeys. Thousands of India's poorest and most repressed women -- fed up with drunken husbands who squander their wages on liquor, then stumble home to beat and berate their wives and children -- have launched what many analysts say is the first large-scale grass-roots women's movement in the country's history. ""Most of the women here were beaten by their husbands,"" said 18-year-old Lachuama, who helped lead attacks on liquor shops in Yadavelli, a farm village of about 1,500 houses. ""We heard about the agitation happening in other places. We started talking: 'It is this consumption of liquor that is leading to wife beating.' We closed the [liquor] shop, and now we'll bash up any man if he goes to other villages to drink or fetch liquor."" For women who are seldom allowed to speak out against their husbands or discuss issues of discrimination even in the privacy of their homes, the demonstrations that have shut down more than 6,000 liquor shops in the sprawling state of Andhra Pradesh represent an extraordinary rebellion against centuries-old traditions. ""It is the first time in India that rural women have started a movement,"" said Sandhya Vallurapalli, president of the Progressive Organization for Women, one of the most vocal women's groups in southern India. ""We hope it's the beginning of a social revolution."" While women's movements have swept Western societies for the past several decades, the globe's most destitute women -- those who populate the villages, farmlands and urban slums of the world's poorest nations -- have only recently begun to test their strength. Throughout the developing world, women are demanding new rights and challenging rigid cultural and religious codes that have embedded gender discrimination in every facet of their daily lives. Their efforts range from winning the right to sell their products in the marketplaces of rural Bangladesh, where religious tradition often forbids women to appear in public places, to attacks on entrenched legal systems that blatantly discriminate against women. They have taken on Muslim leaders who rule the agricultural villages of Bangladesh and Pakistan, abusive landlords who control the lives of farm laborers in India, and factory workers who exploit women employees in China and across Asia.  Coming of Age ""There has been steady progress in the last 20 years,"" said Anita Kelles-Viitanen, chief adviser for the International Labor Organization's women's programs. ""Now the movements are coming of age. With time, the status of women will change, but it will come slowly."" While the efforts have improved the lives of thousands of women in developing nations, the movements have touched only a small percentage of the females in those countries. In many regions, burgeoning population growth, dismal economic conditions, soaring illiteracy and a rise in religious fundamentalism have worsened the plight of tens of millions of women in recent years. In Bangladesh, despite the campaigns of an estimated 10,000 different aid organizations, the number of illiterate women and of women living in poverty has increased in the past decade, while the calorie intake of women in general has decreased dramatically. In Afghanistan, hundreds of women who entered the professional work force while their husbands and fathers were fighting Soviet troops are being banished from offices and jobs in Kabul, the capital, which is now ruled by Islamic fundamentalists. Where women's movements have managed to take root, they have not been born of visionary ideals from the West, but of harsh economic necessity that forced women to get out of their homes and push back their veils in defiance of cultural and religious taboos. ""Women have the same aspirations anywhere in the world,"" said Maleeha Lodi, one of Pakistan's leading editors and columnists. ""But our entire social context is different; it's hard to see how the West is pertinent.""  'Talking About Survival' ""We're talking about survival,"" agreed Mahbood Hassan of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, a nongovernmental organization that has spent almost two decades attempting to improve the lives of Bangladesh's poorest women. ""Moving from absolutely destitute situations to a level where they can eat three meals a day -- this was a dream for many of these women."" Economic and physical survival is at the heart of the anti-liquor movement in India's Andhra Pradesh, a state of more than 66 million people where alcoholism rates among rural men have been found to be as high as 90 percent in some villages and wife beating is virtually universal. Men who earn as little as seven rupees a day -- about 20 cents -- doing back-breaking agricultural labor often spend more than half their wages on alcohol. Before the women's anti-liquor movement began, men would leave the fields and gather at the village liquor shop, where they would lean on crude counters or lounge on front stoops, belting down shots of a potent sugar cane-based drink called arrack. Women, meanwhile, would leave the fields and collect firewood on the way home, where they would prepare the family's dinner. As in many cases of women's empowerment in developing nations, the catalyst for the mass protests was a rudimentary education program for poor women who could neither read nor write. Two years ago, the Indian government targeted two coastal districts in Andhra Pradesh in a nationwide effort to improve literacy. With more than two-thirds of the state's women illiterate -- and female illiteracy as high as 95 percent in some rural pockets -- Andhra Pradesh has one of India's worst literacy records.  A Story-Book Heroine Last October, the women read a story in one primer about a young heroine who mobilized the women in her village to force the local liquor shop to close. The women in the story complained that their husbands were wasting their meager wages on booze rather than food for their families. Women in the study groups, who otherwise had few opportunities to congregate, began trading their own tragic family histories. The weekly lessons became forums for them to discuss their families, and they quickly discovered a common enemy -- alcohol. Their newfound literacy and storybook role model has been parlayed into a self-help movement that has spread across the state and spilled into neighboring jurisdictions, giving politicians the jitters. Dozens of women interviewed in several villages said their lives have changed dramatically since they cut off liquor supplies to their husbands. Many men also conceded that they have begun to realize the damage that alcohol had done to their families. ""My husband used to beat me after coming back from the arrack shop,"" said Anusuya, 35, who lives in Nemmanu, a village of about 2,000 people where women have shut down all three liquor shops. ""Now he's concentrating on his job and sharing time with the family and not sneaking off to drink."" The anti-liquor movement has forced the government to reconsider its policies of selling cheap liquor in thousands of government-licensed shops, and it has pitted village women against powerful political forces. Local politicians, many of whom own liquor franchises, warn that public services will suffer if liquor sales are banned, because taxes from the sale of arrack are the state's second-largest revenue source. In addition, the intelligence wing of the state police has decided that the primer story that inspired the movement is ""not in conformity with the policies of the state government"" and will be deleted from future literacy programs. But the young anti-liquor movement has already spread to other social issues. In the Andhra Pradesh town of Nandipet, women and children complaining they were tired of their husbands and fathers spending nights at brothels recently stormed the red-light district and reduced many brothels to rubble. ""In a single day we achieved what could not be done by the administration in 25 years,"" one jubilant woman told the Pioneer newspaper. Most of the women's movements in developing nations have been far less dramatic or visible than the anti-liquor demonstrations in Andhra Pradesh. The advancement of women in poor nations from South America to Africa to Asia is more frequently measured in improved living conditions, greater access to jobs, or simple survival in cultures that have few support mechanisms for single women, abandoned wives or widows. Nongovernmental aid organizations -- both local and international -- have been driving forces behind many of the smaller-scale women's movements, providing access to a few dollars worth of credit or a few hours of informal education, which often give women the courage to stand up against abuse and discrimination. In a major shift in recent years, a growing number of aid groups have begun targeting women.  Women as Strength ""Women are the strength of this society, if you can bring them out and provide opportunity,"" said Fazle Hasan Abed, executive director of the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, which helped pioneer the concept of targeting women in developing countries. ""Men have created the poverty in Bangladesh; women manage the poverty in Bangladesh."" The committee and Bangladesh's innovative Grameen Bank have been world leaders in providing bank loans to poor rural women. Financial credit and education, they say, are the two most successful means of empowering the world's poorest women. ""Women are far more credit worthy than men,"" said Abed. ""They use resources better, they're better managers. You see a 3-year-old girl, and she is looking after a younger child while the 5-year-old brother is playing outside. She is managing from a very early age."" One loan program of the Rural Advancement Committee helps landless female farm laborers finance the construction of water wells on their landlords' property. In return for using the well, the landlord gives the women 25 percent of the harvest in addition to their daily wages, which often amount to a few cents a day. Last summer, women who had received a well loan near the central Bangladeshi town of Mizapur were outraged when the landlord piled only 10 percent of the rice harvest on their pushcarts. ""You are trying to cheat us just because we are women,"" the women protested. In a rare show of aggression, dozens of the farm laborers converged on the town police station, demanding that officials enforce the agreement. A village court ruled in favor of the women. ""This is where our success lies,"" said Kazi Jahandir Kavir, a committee program organizer. ""We try to make them conscious of their rights."" But leaders of women's causes throughout the developing world say that without major attitudinal changes, little can be done to improve the condition of women. ""You can't just bring an end to discrimination,"" said Ranjana Kumari, who heads New Delhi's Center for Social Research and has authored several books on women in India. ""Social attitudes have to change. A total way of life has to change. And whenever you start a project that will bring social change, there's always a major struggle."" Religion frequently provides the battlefield. The Bangladesh Rural Aid Committee and other organizations have been targeted by Muslim fundamentalists who have accused them of undermining Islamic law and local tradition by encouraging women to assert themselves outside the home. ""The religious leaders perceive us as a force against fundamentalism -- and we are,"" said committee director Abed. He recounted one incident in which local religious leaders complained that the committee was corrupting village women by teaching them to ride bicycles to reduce the commuting time for their chores. ""The mullahs said, 'Women don't ride bicycles,' "" recalled Abed. ""I said, 'Where in the Koran does it say women don't ride bicycles?' ""  The Next Generation The Rural Advancement Committee and hundreds of other organizations in developing nations pin their hopes for the next generation of women on education but concede the obstacles are formidable. In Bangladesh, only 10 percent of girls aged 10 to 14 are enrolled in school, compared to 23 percent of boys in the same age range. The committee operates 11,000 schools for about 330,000 boys and girls who have either dropped out of the government school system or never attended school. While public education is free, the cost of uniforms, pencils and notebooks is often far more than impoverished families can afford. Many poor families also choose to keep their children -- especially daughters -- out of school to work at home or in the fields. ""My parents didn't allow me to go to the government school because of housework,"" said Shahida Akhtar, a shy 13-year-old girl with large, liquid brown eyes who attends the committee's Kodalia School. ""This school suits us better because of the shorter hours. I can finish early and go back and still help my mother with household chores."" In addition to economic and educational inequity, many women in the developing world are severely discriminated against by their country's laws. And even where there are civil laws and constitutional safeguards against discrimination, nations such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have cultural traditions and religious laws that supersede many of them. ""There is entrenched written inequality in our laws,"" said Sara Hossain, a Dhaka-based attorney and a vocal advocate of a Uniform Family Civil Code that would override the Islamic laws that control family life in Bangladesh. ""The situation remains pretty bleak."" Hindu customs in India and Muslim law in Pakistan, Bangladesh and many Middle Eastern countries give women few rights in matters of divorce or custody of their children and guarantees them little, if any, inheritance from their families. Most political parties in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have women's wings and some women have risen to lead their nations -- such as Indira Gandhi in India, Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan and Khaleda Zia, the current prime minister of Bangladesh. But these female leaders have shied away from implementing changes that would provide significant improvement in the lives of their poorest women. Activists throughout the Third World agree that political, economic and social changes for women, in most cases, will be far more evolutionary than revolutionary. ""This society's traditions will take another generation to change,"" said Ranjana Kumari of New Delhi's Center for Social Research.",1993,"India"
"105","The Missing Millions; Deadly Discrimination Leads to High Mortality Rate","Asia","Where have all the women gone? The number of men and women in a country hypothetically should be about equal, demographers say. But according to the most recent census statistics compiled by the United Nations, tens of millions of women are missing, especially in Asia. Bangladesh and Afghanistan, for instance, have only 94 women for every 100 men; India has 93 women per 100 men, and Pakistan, only 92. Official Chinese figures show that in 1990 there were 113 boys for every 100 girls under age 1, while for children between 1 and 2 the ratio had risen to 114 boys for every 100 girls. The five countries combined are now missing at least 77 million females -- more than the entire combined populations of California, New York, Texas and Florida, according to figures drawn from U.N. statistics. ""The preference for sons translates into unconscious neglect of girls, leading to higher mortality,"" said a joint report by the United Nations Children's Fund and the government of Pakistan, explaining one reason why that country has 6.3 million more men than women. Experts point to the life-threatening discrimination that women must endure, making their chances of survival lower than men's: sex-selective abortion and infanticide, poor nutrition and health care, multiple pregnancies and backbreaking physical labor. In many parts of the developing world, women simply die faster than men. Sociologists and other experts studying discrimination against women say the figures are all the more alarming because scientific and historic data prove that worldwide, females are more likely to survive birth and live longer than men. In developed countries such as the United States, France, Switzerland and Britain, women outnumber men by a ratio of 105 to 100. Experts also point to another form of discrimination that is reducing the number of women on paper: Women don't count, figuratively or literally. Census-takers are usually men and they often ignore females. In conservative Islamic cultures especially, male census-takers are not allowed to talk to females, who often are hidden from public view. And husbands and fathers frequently are ashamed if they have too many daughters and not enough sons, so they lie about the sex of their children. Phony numbers creep into other areas as well. It is ""a matter of family dishonor if the household women are known (or seen) to be working,"" according to another report on Pakistan, so women's work is simply not counted. Even though it is widely accepted that as many as 80 percent of the women who live in rural Pakistan are agricultural laborers, ""the census of 1981 states that there are only 148 women working in agriculture,"" a United Nations report said. ""The absurdity of such a statement speaks for itself."" Kumud Sharma, director of New Delhi's Center for Women's Development Studies, said that bad demographics ""is just not enough to explain this discrepancy. ""It's the sheer neglect of girls -- access to health care, inequality of food, strong son preference, female infanticide. The prejudice is just so deep-rooted,"" Sharma said.",1993,"Pakistan"
"106","Indian Navy, Learning From Tailhook, Teaches Gender Sensitivity","Asia","It seemed like a familiar scenario: Drunken male naval officers at a spring party groping embarrassed female officers. But this was not the U.S. Navy's infamous Tailhook convention in Las Vegas but a classroom at an Indian naval training center, where male officers are learning how not to treat their female counterparts. In a country where bride burnings and female infanticide are regularly reported, it was the American Tailhook scandal -- in which male officers fondled and harassed female officers attending an aviation convention in 1992 -- that helped persuade India's navy to conduct gender awareness training as it integrates its first female officers into the service. ""With the introduction of women into the navy, we need to train our men to accept women in the service,"" the Directorate of Naval Training wrote in the introduction of its new course, ""and condition them to the required behavioral and attitudinal changes."" That is no easy task in a culture that frequently discriminates against women from birth and in a military that inducted its first female field officers (outside of its medical corps) only two years ago. For the first time in India's history, women are being allowed to pilot aircraft for the air force, serve as ordnance officers in the army and run logistics offices for the navy. For both men and women, it has been a revolutionary change in the greatest male bastion of a male-dominated culture. Despite the hardships of breaking into the all-male services, the response from women has been overwhelming in a country where there traditionally have been very few professional options for women. In July 1992, when the air force announced its first positions for 12 women officers, 24,000 women applied. The number of applications has been similar in the army and navy, according to military officials. Even so, the women remain a very small minority in the Indian armed forces. The fourth-largest military in the world now has 35 female officers in the navy, 50 in the army and 55 in the air force. Enlisted ranks, with the exception of medical and legal services, have not been opened to women. The Indian navy has been the most open of the three military services in facing up to the obstacles female officers confront. In a frank assessment of its personnel, the navy said in a written response to questions about its new gender training program: ""Most of the work force of the navy hails from traditionally male-dominated families, for some of whom the very thought of taking orders from women is unacceptable."" But when the navy began its course, simply titled, ""Men, Women and Society,"" it learned that the enlisted troops were not the only ones with ingrained prejudice. ""There was a lot of resentment from the older officers that this was not a woman's domain, that they wouldn't be able to cope with war,"" said Martha Farrell, one of the sociologists hired by the navy to design its gender training program. Farrell and her associates at the organization Creative Learning for Change pulled many ideas from the U.S. military's training programs for gender awareness, but their final product delves much deeper into social and cultural prejudices than the programs used by the U.S. armed forces. The naval training program here begins with Farrell's premise that change for women in India has ""occurred only at a superficial level,"" and while a woman's ""roles and responsibilities have increased, her status in the family and society remains largely unchanged."" In one phase of the course, newly commissioned officers were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with statements such as, ""Daughters must be educated in order to get a marriage, sons to get a good career."" The majority of the male officers agreed with the statement, according to Farrell. An overwhelming majority of the men also believed that women invite sexual harassment by their dress and behavior, and said they saw nothing wrong with the male officers who rubbed their hands on the female officers attending the mock spring celebration party at the officers' club. As for the few dozen women who emerged officers from the tens of thousands of applications to the services: ""These are not traditional women coming out of the villages,"" said Farrell. ""These women already belong to the middle class and a lot of their battles already have been won."" But even the women who beat the odds came to the gender training classes with traditional questions, according to Farrell. ""One group of women officers didn't know whether they'd be able to work after getting married,"" said Farrell. ""Some questioned: 'Who are we going to marry because our jobs are so different?' "" Female officers have received strong support from wives of male officers, who are hoping their husbands will bring gender sensitivity home with them. This contrasts with the experience in the U.S. military, where wives were among the vocal opponents of sexual integration. The gender awareness training courses incorporated cases that were provided by the Indian navy wives' association from the files of their wives support services. The cases include instances of officers who secretly kept two wives, sailors who tricked their uneducated wives into divorces that left them penniless, and numerous instances of wife beating. The classroom debates also have prompted questions from male officers who said they feared being accused unjustly of sexual harassment, an issue only recently raised in Indian society. One officer involved in conducting swimming courses for new officers said his male staff was hampered in teaching women because the male instructors were not allowed to touch their female students during the training sessions for fear of being accused of molesting the women. ""As a result the women aren't learning how to swim,"" the male officer claimed.",1994,"India"
"107","Women's Rights Dispute Rages; Westerners, Religious Conservatives Tangle at U.N. Meeting","Asia","A long-festering dispute between women's groups in the West and religious conservatives from Catholic and Islamic countries broke out this week in a rancorous debate over women's sexual and reproductive rights. U.S. and European delegates to a U.N. women's conference pressed for resolutions endorsing broader access to sexual health services, including birth control and abortion, for women around the world. They also called for greater legal protection against various forms of violence against women, such as female genital mutilation, spousal rape and ""honor killings"" of women suspected of adultery or premarital sex. They have been stymied, however, by delegates from predominantly Catholic and Islamic states--including the Vatican, Nicaragua, Libya, Sudan, Iraq and Iran--some of whom accused Western women's advocates of ""sexual colonialism."" The dispute underscored the hostility that remains between the two camps five years after they squared off over many of the same issues at a landmark women's conference in Beijing. This week's meeting was intended to assess how much progress women have made since the 1995 conference, where delegates from more than 180 countries published a 150-page document urging governments to promote equality and prevent abuses of women. Delegates agreed in principle today on a call to ""eradicate harmful customary or traditional practices"" against women--including marital rape, forced marriages and the murder of brides over their dowries. In a draft document, they also called on countries to prevent sexual exploitation, including trafficking in women for forced prostitution. Francoise Gerard, a public health expert for the International Women's Health Coalition, said there was broad consensus on the need to reduce women's deaths during childbirth, which number about 600,000 a year. But she said there was enormous resistance to language calling for access to birth control and abortion for women and girls. ""We want full and equal access of adolescents to sexual and reproductive health education and services,"" while the conservatives' position ""is that adolescents should just say no,"" Gerard said. The dispute was holding up formal agreement last night on a consensus document reporting on achievements since Beijing and laying out goals. Gita Sen, an Indian law professor, accused the conservatives of blocking consensus through a ""tyranny of the minority."" Catholic and Islamic delegates responded that Western industrial nations were trying to force their ""cultural standards"" on the rest of the world. Some of the conservatives objected in particular to a U.S. and European proposal to condemn discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, which they view as an endorsement of homosexuality. ""I will not accept people telling me that they are more moral than us,"" said one Arab negotiator who requested anonymity. ""They tell me that girls should have sexual rights. This is nonsense."" The diplomat added that the Western nations' focus on sexual rights was designed to distract attention from their failure to meet their previous commitments to contribute more money to development aid, education and anti-poverty programs in the developing world.",2000,"China"
"108","Pakistani Women's Flawed Icon; Slain Ex-Premier Bhutto Raised Expectations for Advancement but Largely Failed to Fulfill Them","Asia","LAHORE, Pakistan -- Wrapped in tattered wool blankets, Bashiran and her neighbors trekked for three hours from their dusty rural villages to wait amid the polished offices and whirring computers in a bank here in Lahore, one of the many branches set up across Pakistan by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Looking down shyly at her modest cotton clothes and cracked plastic sandals, Bashiran, a 45-year-old mother of six, shuffled up to the teller's window for a $300 loan -- money that would allow her to pay for a donkey cart and rent it out to other poor women in her village. Her plan was working, she said, except for a haunting reality that made her feel sick to her stomach. ""I promised to give my husband and son the rupees, since they told me I had to,"" she said, as her friends gently touched her arm in empathy, adding that their male relatives had also demanded control over their loan money. ""It's my duty. Life for women of Pakistan is not our own. The men are always the head of our bodies and hearts."" The scene playing out in the bank's lobby was a testament to the complex and often confounding legacy that Bhutto left Pakistan upon her recent death and to the ways Pakistani women remain subservient to their brothers and husbands, fathers and sons. As the first woman elected leader of a Muslim country, Bhutto raised expectations for the advancement of women. But she struggled to overcome deep-rooted cultural obstacles; the institutions she created were enmeshed in problems of their own and have failed to free women from the bonds of tradition. While Bhutto's assassination Dec. 27 has left many Pakistani women mourning, it has left others with a sense of disappointment. ""To me, Bhutto wasn't a feminist icon. She was just another corrupt Pakistani politician,"" said Chand Rahiem, 25, who sat with a group of female friends in a cafe. ""Pakistan has no heroes or heroines. It just has a very complex and troubled history -- and now a very confusing and unclear future."" Bhutto's two turbulent terms as prime minister, from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1996, were indeed stained by charges of mismanagement and graft. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, who is now running her Pakistan People's Party, was nicknamed ""Mr. 10 Percent"" for his alleged habit of accepting bribes. Allegations of malfeasance extended to the women's bank that Bhutto helped create. In the 1990s, some of the bank's tellers were accused of conning illiterate women into signing for loans exceeding the amount they actually received. Some critics say the bank continues to take advantage of poor, vulnerable women, charging them exorbitant interest rates. Bashiran, who said she signed loan papers without knowing what they said, was saddled with a whopping 16 percent rate. Bhutto's supporters acknowledge her shortcomings but also point to what she was able to achieve. ""Despite her flaws, one impact she did have is that she started to talk about women's issues, things that no one thought could be talked about,"" said Asma Jahangir, a human rights advocate who has been both a critic and an admirer of Bhutto. ""And Pakistanis began to see issues about the treatment of female servants or rape or bonded labor less as the ranting of obscure women's groups and more an important part of societal debate."" Across South Asia, women are plagued by paradoxes pertaining to gender. The subcontinent has had more female leaders than any other region in the world, yet the health care and education available to its women are among the world's worst. About 70 percent of Pakistani women are illiterate. Domestic violence is still considered a private, family issue. And beatings, along with acid attacks, still occur in 80 percent of rural homes, according to a study by the country's Human Rights Commission. The contrast between the achievements of female leaders and the lowly status of ordinary women has its roots in the region's dynastic traditions. Professions here are inherited, in politics as in industry. In India, former prime minister Indira Gandhi came into politics through relatives; in Bangladesh, former prime minister Khaleda Zia did the same. Bhutto inherited her station in political life from her father and mentor, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. ""In South Asia, we tend to specialize in women leaders. But they always hail from a feudal hierarchy. They are schooled and raised in those elite circles,"" said retired justice Nasira Iqbal, daughter-in-law of the Pakistani poet and political leader Allama Iqbal and one of the first female judges appointed in Pakistan, under Bhutto in 1994. ""Bhutto was an icon for women. But she was also a very astute politician who had to balance conservative forces. She couldn't just be a women's rights activist."" In the West, Bhutto, with degrees from Radcliffe and Oxford, became a symbol of female empowerment in a Muslim country. Yet at home she was Pakistan's princess and a ""daughter of destiny,"" as she often described herself -- an icon of Pakistani royalty more than of a women's revolution. In 1988, Bhutto won a seat in Parliament from the city of Peshawar largely through the support of men. Women were often prevented from  voting. She gave birth while  prime minister after keeping her pregnancy secret for as long as she could to avoid attacks from conservative Islamic parties. Supporters of Bhutto, who was just 35 when she first came to power, point out that she had to deal with the legacy of her predecessor, Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, a military dictator who for a decade oversaw the imposition of laws that subjected women to unfair treatment. In addition to establishing a nationwide bank to help women become self-reliant, they said, she helped open police stations for women and created special seats reserved for women in the national and provincial assemblies. ""Bhutto was up against extreme challenges. She wasn't even in office long enough to be judged the first time,"" said Azma Zahid Bukhari, 31, who is running for a seat reserved for a woman in the provincial assembly in Punjab province. ""But I was 10 years old when Bhutto first became prime minister. You can't even imagine the pride that sends to a girl. Everyone in my school was talking about it, and the boys actually got the message: Women could rule Pakistan."" But Bhutto was also criticized for failing to improve the status of Pakistani women through legislation; activists were disappointed that she was unable to effect the repeal of the Hudood Ordinance, which required rape victims to produce four male witnesses before a court would convict and left women open to charges of adultery. ""Bhutto wanted to do so many things for women. I believe she really did have a deep vision for that,"" said Iqbal, the retired justice. ""But the reality was that she didn't have the coalition government that could make significant progress."" Bhutto's complex legacy can be seen inside the Lahore branch of the First Women Bank, which has 35 branches and the slogan ""The World's Only Bank for Women."" The women working busily at their desks are like many in cosmopolitan cities such as Lahore. They are members of Pakistan's elite, as comfortable in blue jeans as they are in salwar-kameez, the loose traditional dress. Many have attended American universities. Back in Pakistan, they can sit with boyfriends at cafes and delay marriage for careers -- options they would not have elsewhere in the Muslim world. But the women applying for the loans come from the impoverished countryside, where girls are still raped in feuds to bring shame on their families. Looking over their money, some of the women said they might keep a little cash for themselves, away from their husbands and brothers. They praised the bank for giving them a chance and said they would always admire and love Bhutto. ""Bhutto was our protector,"" said Bashiran, who tucked the cash into her bra. ""To us, she's at least tried to help.""",2008,"Pakistan"
"109","A War on Pakistan's Schoolgirls","Asia","I have such fond childhood memories of summer holidays in the Swat Valley  in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province, a place well known among Pakistanis for its breathtaking views, cool summer climate and lush fruit orchards. But today the Swat Valley is experiencing heartbreaking pressures, as the Taliban strike with disconcerting regularity and, among other atrocities, impose a ban on the education of girls. Even before this ban was put in place on Jan. 15, more than 100 schools for girls in Swat, as well as more than 150 such schools in the greater Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), had been shut down, many after being bombed or torched, leaving approximately 100,000 girls out of school. Radio announcements warned girls that they could be attacked with acid if they dared to attend school, and teachers have been threatened and killed. Last Monday, five more Swat Valley schools were bombed. The attacks and threats have not been confined to schoolgirls. Women and girls have been ordered to wear full veils. Directives have been issued requiring that women be accompanied by male family members in public places and forbidding women from carrying compulsory government identification cards displaying their photographs. About a dozen women have been shot for ""immoral activities,"" including Bakht Zeba, a 45-year-old social worker  committed to advancing girls' education. The area seems to be in competition with Afghanistan over which will establish the worst record on women's rights. The Pakistani and Afghan governments have responded similarly to the Taliban's penchant for terrorizing the population. A few months ago, Afghanistan sought to enter into negotiations with the Taliban, a precondition of which would be the imposition of sharia (Islamic law). While those talks have not yet gone forward, Pakistan seems to be on the brink of accepting enforcement of sharia in the FATA territories. Reports indicate that more than 70 Taliban courts already operate in the Swat Valley, a first step toward implementation of the Taliban's interpretation of sharia. That the government is open to negotiating on this issue shows that it has no regard for what such a move would mean for Pakistani women. The lives of Afghan women and girls remain precarious. Schoolgirls continue to be attacked. Women in public office are threatened or killed. Malalai Joya, a female political leader who has been wrongly suspended from  parliament, has been forced into hiding because of threats against her. Only a few months ago, Malalai Kakar, Afghanistan's most senior female police officer, was shot dead. Pakistan must not become another Afghanistan. The unfolding disaster in Pakistan demands an immediate response both from the Pakistani government and the international community. Pakistan must accept its responsibility to take urgent action to protect the rights of women and to curb the Talibanization of the country. Any intervention must be based on upholding Pakistan's commitments under its own constitution and under international human rights instruments that it has ratified. The various branches of government -- the legislature, executive and judiciary -- must work in concert to address this situation in a comprehensive manner. Last week, the Pakistani government announced that it will reopen the schools in the northern areas in March, after their winter recess, but in view of the loss of huge areas to the effective control of the Taliban, it is clear that will be difficult. On Jan. 20 -- Inauguration Day in the United States -- Parliament voted unanimously to condemn and reject the Jan. 15 Taliban school closings. Now the government should immediately announce its commitment to implementing a plan to ensure that all girls have access to education, as well as to safeguard them not only in school but also outside of school. President Obama has put Pakistan at the forefront of the war on terrorism. The 2008 Biden-Lugar bill in the Senate calling for a tripling of nonmilitary aid to Pakistan, to $1.5 billion annually for five years, is expected to be revived this year as the Kerry-Lugar bill and has the support of the Obama administration. To avoid the mistakes of the Bush administration, not only should there be greater accountability for how these funds are used, but the money should be conditioned on the Pakistani government taking active steps to curb the Talibanization of the country and, in particular, to uphold and protect the rights of girls and women. The consequences of inaction or inadequate action could be devastating.

"110","Pakistani Women's Groups Oppose Zia's Drive for Islamic Rule","Asia","In Pakistan's male-dominated society, some of the most aggressive and sustained opposition to President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq's martial-law government is coming from women. Fearing that their role is being undermined by Zia's campaign to impose strict Islamic values in Pakistan, increasing numbers of women have been taking to the streets to assert feminist rights and holding meetings to challenge martial law. When the movement hesitantly began last year, it was confined largely to a small group of socially prominent professional women who often conducted their meetings in English and inevitably were branded by the government as elitist, western-oriented and ""un-Islamic."" Recently, however, women's groups here and in the Punjab capital of Lahore have begun to broaden their base of support to include housewives from lower economic classes, and to conduct protest meetings in Urdu. While Zia has offered only a few token concessions to the women, the movement has attracted the support of an increasing number of men and has begun assuming a political character that could grow into a more serious challenge to the government. A perception is growing within at least this segment of society that results can be achieved through direct action, and that this could be interpreted as a sign of weakness of the government. The catalyst for the surge of militant feminism was a bill proposed to Zia's handpicked Consultative Council that would require the evidence of two women to equal that of one man. When 200 women demonstrated against the bill in Lahore last month, police wielding clubs and using tear gas broke up the march, injuring 20 of the women. Fundamentalist Islamic teachers called the women ""traitors to Islam"" and threatened to declare any demonstrating women apostates, meaning they could not marry a Moslem. In contrast, the police action was denounced by many Pakistani men as unprecedented brutality toward women in an Islamic country. One newspaper in Islamabad reminded Zia that the last time women protesters were beaten was in 1977, also in Lahore, when they protested the rigging of elections by former prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. That incident galvanized opposition that allowed Zia to overthrow Bhutto and later have him hanged. A furor erupted last summer when a fundamentalist preacher and member of the Consultative Council, Israr Ahmed, began asserting on a regular state television commentary that a woman's place is in the kitchen. ""In Islam, the actual field of movement for a woman remains within four walls,"" he declared, adding that all women should be required to wear a chador, or heavy full-length veil, because they are responsible for sex crimes. The debate over these comments was so intense that Zia was forced to dissociate himself from Ahmed's views, and the commentator was taken off the air. Other targets of protest include: a proposal by the Council of Islamic Ideology, an advisory body drafting new Moslem laws, that compensation to a family for the death of a woman be fixed at half that for a man; increased flogging of women convicted of adultery; a government proposal to establish separate universities for women and a ban on women athletes at the Asian Games in New Delhi last September. Also being challenged is a proposed law that the family of a crime victim can ask for the death penalty only if the victim is male. Pakistani officials counter the grievances by pointing out that most of the proposed laws dealing with women have not yet been implemented, and that the process of Islamization is being conducted slowly to avoid inequities. Zia, whose eldest daughter is a computer programmer in a bank and whose second daughter is a medical school graduate, has said that women have a role in the nation's development but that Islamic values must be broadened because Islam is not only a theology but also a way of life. But women's rights leaders charge they are pawns in what they say is an attempt by Zia to perpetuate martial law in Pakistan. ""Islamization is a farce. It is a justification for continued martial law. He is doing it to convince the junior ranks of the Army that he is all for Islam,"" Shahida Jamil, a Karachi lawyer and activist in the Women's Action Forum, said in an interview. She added, ""The basic principle of Islam is justice, but there is no justice for women in Pakistan today."" Because many of the early organizers in Karachi were supporters of Bhutto's banned Pakistan People's Party, and included many westernized liberals, Jamil said, it was open to charges of being dominated by ""loose, radical, un-Islamic women,"" which alienated many less well-to-do conservative women. The party is headed by Bhutto's widow and daughter. ""We have to bring in the traditional women to make our voice stronger,"" Jamil said, adding that the forum has begun going into Karachi's slums to convince traditional housewives that they are the victims of discrimination. The feminist activists, she said, talk to the housewives first about such immediate problems as child labor, growing narcotics use and sparse public services, and then gradually introduce more conventional feminist issues. ""Eventually it has to be a political struggle. If it the opposition continues without women, it will die. It has to become political,"" Jamil said. Women's groups elsewhere in Pakistan have adopted the government's major weapon--the Koran--to fight discrimination. Sabheeha Hafeez, an Islamabad sociologist, says research by women has demonstrated that incorrect translation of key Arabic words in the Koran has worked against women. The danger the women face, however, is to have their movement become so politicized that Zia will invoke the standing ban on political activity and begin breaking up women's meetings on the basis of their allegedly being subversive. One active male supporter of the movement, Karachi lawyer Khalid Ishaque, said he expects Zia to adopt a familiar tactic in countering opposition. Ishaque, who has argued several court cases on behalf of women's rights, said Zia ""will progressively ignore these women"" until they lose importance. ""He did it to the Pakistan People's Party and other groups, and he can do it again.""",1983,"Pakistan"
"111","Women of the Working Press; Journalists From 39 Countries on Their Place & Profession","Asia","Susan King was twirling pearls and Maureen Bunyan stood poised like, well, Maureen Bunyan. They were attending the International Women's Media Conference at the National Press Club. And Bunyan, along with moderator Karen Elliott-House of The Wall Street Journal and others, was about to join a panel on ""Reporting Around the World -- Conflicts and Conduct."" ""Professionally this is a lot more difficult than talking to the Jaycees,"" said Bunyan, a WUSA-TV newscaster, ""but it's rewarding. It helps me get a perspective of where I stand with other people."" ""In the office, I'm relaxed,"" said Nawal Serry, undersecretary for news programming affairs for Egyptian Television and another ""Conflicts"" panelist. ""But here, I'm not so relaxed."" About 100 women from 38 foreign countries and the United States had gathered for the conference, cochaired by Universal Press Syndicate columnist Georgie Anne Geyer and United Nations Information Centre Director Phyllis Kaminsky and underwritten by the U.S. Information Agency and several corporate sponsors. The four-day event opened with speeches by Washington Post Co. Board Chairman Katharine Graham, USIA Director Charles Z. Wick and National Press Club President Mary Kay Quinlan; it concludes tomorrow. The six women on the ""Conflicts"" panel discussed the occupational difficulties faced by female foreign correspondents. The subsequent panel, ""Relationships,"" was led by King, a WRC-TV anchor, and dealt with the working relationships of women journalists and their colleagues. Both panels were an opportunity for top women journalists to comment on the state of women in what is still a male-dominated profession. News organizations in Europe are ""heavily dominated by men,"" said Polly Toynbee, a reporter with England's The Guardian. Consequently, news issues are ""by men, for men and about men."" But although some panelists spoke of sex discrimination, many stressed that it wasn't just male colleagues and superiors who barred the way to success. ""I always had to work harder to tell me I could do the job,"" said Suhaini Aznam, Malaysian bureau chief for the Hong-Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review. ""That was probably the hardest battle."" ""I must be as competitive with women ... as with men,"" said Hearst Newspapers columnist Marianne Means. ""It used to be that you had to act like a man and think like a lady. But all you have to do is work like a dog."" Both Aznam and Serry said they encountered little or no sexism in Malaysia and Egypt, respectively. ""I never felt discrimination,"" said Serry, who has worked as a journalist since 1956. In the Egyptian radio industry, she said, women account for approximately 31 percent of the work force, and the gender ratio in television jobs is ""50-50."" In Malaysia, Aznam said, ""it is politics, rather than gender, which dictates"" the life of a foreign correspondent, particularly when dealing with the government. Access to information is ""just as difficult for men and women."" For Cristiana Chamorro, editorial page editor of La Prensa, politics transcended gender. Freedom of the press in Nicaragua, she said, is ""for men and women who support a totalitarian government,"" and the Sandinistas have closed down ""any voice contrary ... to their tastes."" There are certain advantages to being a woman journalist, Aznam said. In dangerous situations, she has found that women ""are seen as less of a threat. People don't fear you as they would a man."" In fact, she added, ""male colleagues asked me to accompany them for their protection."" Many women have shown a reluctance to work abroad, said Karen DeYoung, London correspondent for The Washington Post. They were ""much less willing to make the sacrifice,"" and ""had mapped out their careers ... which didn't include going out to the wilds somewhere ... The women I talked to felt a level of visibility was much better attained here in Washington."" Elliott-House expressed a fear that certain women have ""peaked,"" that ""women have grown conservative with success. More and more women are starting to think, 'Is it worth it?' Now that they have something to lose, they feel like risking less, [with a] tendency not to speak up ... But, she said, ""I don't think women got as far as they are by being quiet.""",1986,"Malaysia"
"112","Serfdom and 'Soviet Women'","EECA","To the Editor: As one of those feminists Ruth Daniloff, in her review of Francine du Plessix Gray's ''Soviet Women,'' anticipated taking umbrage with Ms. Gray's rather worn theory that women desire ''to lead and be led,'' I must say that the only thing paradoxical about the ''paradoxal 'equality' '' Ms. Gray describes is her use of the term to describe a situation that, by her own account, is anything but that. Equally disturbing is the double talk exhibited in Ms. Daniloff's review. For example, ''Paradoxically, men discriminate against women in the Soviet Union, treating them in ways that would horrify their Western sisters. But they do not dominate them. Just the opposite. It is a matriarchy.'' What kind of a matriarchy would pay its female workers ''two-thirds of the average male income,'' give women the ''dirty manual jobs,'' insure that women do not ''reach the top'' of the professions and then blame ''the 'masculinized woman' '' for society's ills? What strange logic allows Ms. Daniloff to say that Russian women are tyrannical while ''Russian men . . . had a heritage of serfdom, followed by more than 70 years of dictatorship that . . . robbed them of initiative,'' as if Russian women had not been subject to the same historical forces? What sort of tyrant would create a world in which, by Ms. Daniloff's own admission, ''the average woman undergoes more than seven abortions in a lifetime'' and ''men refuse to shoulder household responsibilities''? And as to Ms. Gray's ''conclusion that the Soviet Union might be as much in need of a men's movement as of a women's movement,'' I'd say they've had one all along. G. HANLON Boston",1990,"Russia"
"113","Evolution in Europe; Sex Magazines and Massage Parlors Test Hungary's New Limits","EECA","Pornography, long banned by the Communists as the worst spawn of Western decadence, has broken into the open in Hungary, taking its place on the newsstands as another example of a newly emboldened press. But the explosion of sexually explicit material has already produced a backlash. Parents, religious groups and feminists are recoiling from the shock of seeing photographs of nudes and graphic depictions of sexual acts on the covers of publications like Sexexpress, Popo, Sexy Lady, Lesbi Girls, Apollo and the other pornographic magazines prominently displayed at their local kiosks. ''It is no wonder after 40 years of oppression that this profit-oriented business is flourishing,'' said Miklos Hasznos, an official of the Christian Democratic Party. ''Pornography is part of democracy, but human rights means taking the other side into consideration, too.'' The Christian Democratic Party, through its newspaper, Yes, began a campaign against pornography last winter, collecting 90,000 signatures. Distributors have since been required to seal sexually explicit material in clear plastic, but now the campaign has moved on to demands that the magazines be wrapped in brown paper or be otherwise kept from plain sight. ''We are only protesting against the fact that these newsstand pictures are practically yelling out to the 13- and 14-year-olds,'' Mr. Hasznos said. Feminists Are Upset Many here expect Hungary's newly elected Parliament to seek to have the growing sex industry brought under some form of control, with the effort spurred by a coalition of center-right and Christian parties led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum. Feminists, upset by the exploitation of women, worry that controls will be put in place for the wrong reasons. ''I'm very depressed,'' said Judit Revesz, an English teacher active in women's groups. She said the spread of these materials was understandable in light of the years of oppression. ''But what is missing from the debate is the articulation of the view that this is offensive to women,'' she said. ''People are mixing liberty with bad taste.'' Laws regulating sexual mores are now in a state of limbo. This is one reason for the increase in sex shops, sex clubs, sex videos and sex advertisements. Practically everything that can be had in Times Square is now for sale in Hungary. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe In this field, Hungary is either far ahead or, depending on the point of view, far behind all the other Eastern European countries emerging from Communist rule. There is no legal pornography for sale in Romania or Czechoslovakia. In Poland the Roman Catholic Church has waged a successful struggle against the open distribution of such material. But in Hungary, along with the graphic photographs, the magazines - those that print articles - stick to standard fare; an ''objective'' history of the breast appears in an issue of Sexexpress, alongside a historical essay on underwear. There are also articles on AIDS and advertisements for dieting devices. Given this competition, many here say Playboy magazine, which began a Hungarian edition last December, has been surpassed. In Hungary, even more than in other Eastern European countries, a strong consensus exists in support of liberalizing the puritanical code imposed by the Communists. A poll taken last fall by the Hungarian Public Opinion Research Institute showed that 75 percent of those interviewed favored legalizing prostitution, with men and women of an equal mind on the issue. Brothels here were closed in the 1950's, and a public debate is under way on when to allow them to reopen. King of Hungarian Pornography Antal Laszlo Voros, the self-styled king of Hungarian pornography, is not worried about any kind of a clampdown. ''Hungarians have always been more relaxed about sex, and more aggressive about business, than others,'' he said, adding that a petition signed by thousands ''is not enough to stop millions.'' ''I have talked to a lot of members of the Hungarian Democratic Forum,'' Mr. Voros said. ''They are just like us. They like to make love; they like pretty girls.'' Mr. Voros says he refuses to advertise sex with animals, with children, or between men, but otherwise the only limit he sees is what the market in Hungary will bear. ''For five years, it will keep going up and then it will stagnate,'' he said. Mr. Voros, 37 years old, a former journalist, photographer and part-time magician, started with a nudist travel agency and has gone on to create an empire built on pornography. He now operates Budapest's only sex club, publishes six photos-only sex magazines, sells sex tours to Thailand, Greece and other countries, has filmed two pornographic movies and has many more plans - including brothels, a fleet of sex taxis to provide transport for call girls, two sex ships on Lake Balaton in Hungary, and expectations for a pornography export business to Romania, Czechoslovakia and even the Soviet Union if that markets there open up. Boasting of His Success Clearly enjoying his role as kingpin of Hungary's sex business, Mr. Voros likes to boast of his success, even embellish it. Since he went into the business full time a year ago - he still has a car repair and an advertising business on the side - he said he has grossed up to $15 million. Whatever the exact amount, it is apparently enough to build himself a villa with eight rooms and two swimming pools on 10 acres overlooking Budapest, and to make him into one of Hungary's most visibly successful small entrepreneurs. Mr. Voros said the business took off last June when it became clear to him and his contacts at the Ministry of Trade that pornography was no longer off limits. Until then, he had periodically been harassed by the police during filming of his movies, he said. As it is, many of the regular customers of Mr. Voros's sex club - a cramped bar in a backyard in Budapest's Ninth District, decorated with sex paraphernalia and equipped with sauna and massage room in the back - are foreigners, mostly Germans who find the prices in Hungary cheap. The cost of a sex massage is $50 at the official exchange rate. Mr. Voros says he believes that by allowing pornography last summer, the authorities, then still Communist, were making a deliberate effort to siphon off political pressure. ''If we want to be truthful, it was used to take people's attentions from problems - like rising prices,'' he said. ''By giving people pornography, travel and free passports, this was how they tried to cover up for the bad life.'' ''My goal is to have bad conditions,'' Mr. Voros said. ''Then people will spend their sorrow on women and travel.''",1990,"Hungary"
"114","Word for Word / Papal Letter; To the Women of the World: An Affirmation of 'Feminine Genius'","EECA","IT is a rare day that Pope John Paul II strikes a chord that echoes fairly well with Roman Catholic feminists. Only about a year ago he infuriated many church liberals by telling the faithful to abandon any thought of women becoming priests. But last week, the Pope issued a letter to women that was notable not just for its clarity but also for a personal apology for those in the church who had contributed to the oppression of women. The Pope endorsed ""real equality"" between the sexes, condemned sexual violence and expressed admiration for women who had struggled for their rights. Although he ceded nothing on the all-male priesthood, he chose not to dwell on it. In its timing, the document was hardly a thunderbolt from the blue. It was intended to help shape the debate leading up to the United Nations' conference on women, to be held in Beijing in September, which the Vatican fears will be influenced by Western feminist ideas with which it does not agree. Church officials have already criticized the draft document for the conference as ""unbalanced,"" saying it slights motherhood. They have said they want to change a section condemning ""forced pregnancy"" so that the words don't appear to condone abortion in cases of rape. The Pope's letter, excerpted below, sought to stake out ground on which church and many women can stand together. In its directness and affirmative tone, the 16-page letter follows the page-and-a-half chapter on women in the Pontiff's best-selling book, ""Crossing the Threshold of Hope"" (Knopf, 1994).   GUSTAV NIEBUHR  Women's dignity has often been unacknowledged and their prerogatives misrepresented; they have often been relegated to the margins of society and even reduced to servitude. This has prevented women from truly being themselves and it has resulted in a spiritual impoverishment of humanity. Certainly it is no easy task to assign the blame for this, considering the many kinds of cultural conditioning which down the centuries have shaped ways of thinking and acting. And if objective blame, especially in particular historical contexts, has belonged to not just a few members of the Church, for this I am truly sorry. May this regret be transformed, on the part of the whole Church, into a renewed commitment of fidelity to the Gospel vision. When it comes to setting women free from every kind of exploitation and domination, the Gospel contains an ever relevant message which goes back to the attitude of Jesus Christ himself. . . .  Motherhood Penalized Yes, it is time to examine the past with courage, to assign responsibility where it is due in a review of the long history of humanity. Women have contributed to that history as much as men and, more often than not, they did so in much more difficult conditions. I think particularly of those women who loved culture and art, and devoted their lives to them in spite of the fact that they were frequently at a disadvantage from the start, excluded from equal educational opportunities, underestimated, ignored and not given credit for their intellectual contributions. . . . To this great, immense feminine ""tradition"" humanity owes a debt which can never be repaid. Yet how many women have been and continue to be valued more for their physical appearance than for their skill, their professionalism, their intellectual abilities, their deep sensitivity; in a word, the very dignity of their being! And what shall we say of the obstacles which in so many parts of the world still keep women from being fully integrated into social, political and economic life? We need only think of how the gift of motherhood is often penalized rather than rewarded, even though humanity owes its very survival to this gift. Certainly, much remains to be done to prevent discrimination against those who have chosen to be wives and mothers. As far as personal rights are concerned, there is an urgent need to achieve real equality in every area: equal pay for equal work, protection for working mothers, fairness in career advancements, equality of spouses with regard to family rights. . . . Then, too, when we look at one of the most sensitive aspects of the situation of women in the world, how can we not mention the long and degrading history, albeit often an ""underground"" history, of violence against women in the area of sexuality? At the threshold of the Third Millennium we cannot remain indifferent and resigned before this phenomenon. The time has come to condemn vigorously the types of sexual violence which frequently have women for their object and to pass laws which effectively defend them from such violence. Nor can we fail, in the name of the respect due to the human person, to condemn the widespread hedonistic and commercial culture which encourages the systematic exploitation of sexuality. . . .  Heroic Love In contrast to these sorts of perversion, what great appreciation must be shown to those women who, with a heroic love for the child they have conceived, proceed with a pregnancy resulting from the injustices of rape. Here we are thinking of atrocities perpetrated not only in situations of war, still so common in the world, but also in societies which are blessed by prosperity and peace and yet are often corrupted by a culture of hedonistic permissiveness which aggravates tendencies to aggressive male behavior. In these cases the choice to have an abortion always remains a grave sin. But before being something to blame on a woman, it is a crime for which guilt needs to be attributed to men and to the complicity of the general social environment. . . . Here I cannot fail to express my admiration for those women of good will who have devoted their lives to defending the dignity of womanhood by fighting for their basic social, economic and political rights, demonstrating courageous initiative at a time when this was considered extremely inappropriate, the sign of a lack of femininity, a manifestation of exhibitionism, and even a sin!. . . We then are told that, from the very beginning, man has been created ""male and female"" (Genesis 1:27). Scripture itself provides the interpretation of this fact: even though man is surrounded by the innumerable creatures of the created world, he realizes that he is alone (cf. Gen 2:20). God intervenes in order to help him escape from this situation of solitude: ""It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him"" (Gen 2:18). The creation of woman is thus marked from the outset by the principle of help: a help which is not one-sided but mutual. Woman complements man, just as man complements woman. . . . In this vast domain of service, the Church's 2,000-year history, for all its historical conditioning, has truly experienced the ""genius of woman""; from the heart of the Church there have emerged women of the highest caliber who have left an impressive and beneficial mark in history. . . . The life of the Church in the Third Millennium will certainly not be lacking in new and surprising manifestations of ""the feminine genius.""",1995,"slovakia"
"115","Women Redefine Their Roles in New Russia","EECA","As women walked with bouquets of flowers, gifts from the men in their lives on this Women's Day, a small group of friends here in Russia's northern industrial and cultural center were celebrating in a different way. Two were sitting in a smoke-filled art-scene cafe watching the film ""I Shot Andy Warhol,"" about the radical American feminist Valerie Solanis. Another was home with her children. Still another was painting banners for a demonstration to remind residents what the Russian observance of International Women's Day -- a national holiday here since Soviet times -- is really about. ""It's a fake holiday,"" said Olga Lipovskaya, 49, chairwoman of the St. Petersburg Center for Gender Issues. ""All these flowers, they are false offerings of affection. I don't want a tulip. I would rather have rights, power and money."" While for most in Russia, Women's Day is a a time for flowers, perfume and boxes of candy, for these St. Petersburg intellectuals, it is a time to reflect about what it means to be a woman in this society. Only one of the four friends would call herself a feminist. But they find a certain sisterhood with each other and live in ways that even the most emancipated Western women might find intimidatingly liberated. For St. Petersburg, Women's Day has a particularly meaningful past. Many historians argue that it was the women of St. Petersburg, who celebrated the day in 1917 with a demonstration ""for bread and peace,"" who touched off the overthrow of the czar. Soon thereafter, Russian women were among the first in the world to receive the right to vote, in part as a result of efforts by radical Russian feminists like Aleksandra Kollontai. Women's Day ""is a holiday to celebrate the absolutely wonderful radicalism of the 1920's,"" said Alla Mitrofanova, one of the four friends, who helped Russian women learn about the Internet in the early 1990's. The Soviets imposed egalitarianism from above. A quota system ensured that women occupied a certain number of government posts. Women studied at universities alongside men. Cafeterias, laundries and day care centers opened in cities to ease women's burden at home. In today's Russia, however, the quota system has been eliminated and women have all but disappeared from top government posts. The privatization of state assets after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 overwhelmingly benefited men. At the same time, women, who for years had worked in factories and on construction sites, took pleasure in abandoning such toil for the life of a homemaker. Ms. Mitrofanova, 43, made such a choice. Despite her nontraditional approach to motherhood -- she chose a father for her children by asking various male friends -- she decided to become a stay-at-home mother for her two sons. She deplores the fact that women's work in the home is not valued and talks wistfully of the social services, like free day care, secured by feminists during the early Soviet era, but now in decline. ""Women will never win in the fight within the establishment for power,"" she said, in her disheveled kitchen in central St. Petersburg. ""Why should I try when I can achieve so much more at home?"" In Russia today, feminism, and activism more generally, is regarded with suspicion. Russians, cynical from the economic chaos of the past decade and the force-fed politics of Soviet times, scorn activism as pathetically naive. Besides, the problems of other social groups, like migrants from the Caucasus who face tremendous prejudice in Russia, are much more serious, the women in this circle said. Even so, Ms. Lipovskaya and her helpers were painting signs on Friday for today's demonstration. A self-described former hippie, who worked in low-paying cleaning and doorman jobs in Soviet times, she is one of the very few advocates of political protest. In 1992, a year after the demise of the Soviet Union, she founded the Gender Center. ""Feminism in Russia is associated with primitive stereotypes,"" she said in her sun-drenched office, which is based in a worn but stately St. Petersburg apartment. ""Feminists are either lesbians, ugly women who couldn't get a man, or crazy. No one here understands it's a huge field, not just activism."" Ms. Lipovskaya asserts that women have lost out in the last decade during Russia's transition to capitalism. Even so, when men and women found themselves adrift in the free-for-all that followed Communism's collapse, suddenly facing the loss of jobs and identities, it was women who proved more adaptive, landing jobs in the service industry and in small businesses, while men groped for jobs with similar status. ""The situation for women compared with Soviet times got worse,"" she said. ""Most women's organizations are self-help centers. But these problems need to be resolved in politics."" Despite the sharp decline in political representation, which many argue was in any case only for show and did not give women any real power, women seem to have done better than men in the economic transition. While life expectancies for men fell four years, to 59 years from 63, in the decade ending in 2001, women's life spans fell by only two, to 72. Alcoholism was largely responsible for men's catastrophic decline. Another member of this group of friends, Roza Khatskelevich, provides a model for other women through the sheer force of her professional success. Ms. Khatskelevich, an administrator in an arts academy in Soviet times, runs a large resource center for nongovernmental organizations that she founded in 1992. She shies from the feminist label, though, saying it puts her in a box. ""I have no political platforms,"" she said. ""I don't like the system of rules the word 'feminist' implies."" Even so, she has reared her son as a single mother, while providing leadership to her mostly female staff, and, by all accounts, she has lived the life of an empowered woman. Russian women do not identify with Western models of feminism, she said, because, quite simply, they do not feel discriminated against. That could be changing, as younger women come of age. Irina Aktuganova, director of the Cyber-Femin-Club, a group that helps women use the Internet, and the small cafe where the film was showing, said universities were starting to create gender studies departments. Younger women, who remember little of the Soviet Union, no longer think of the gender studies as something alien. In addition, women are beginning to enter local governments, although in the lowest positions. The St. Petersburg League of Women Voters, affiliated with the American group, says 43 percent of local administrators are women, up from 32 percent in 1998. Women's rights were not appreciated in Soviet times because they were imposed by decree and never fought for, said Ms. Aktuganova, adding, ""Young women don't fear the word feminism."" That is true for Elena Gres, 20, a third-year student at the Nevsky Institute of Language and Culture, a new private college. Ms. Gres, from a Siberian oil town, has discussed gender issues in class, something that got her thinking about women's political representation. ""I thought a feminist was someone who poured her own wine and opened doors for herself,"" said Ms. Gres, in a St. Petersburg cafe. ""A woman should be able to bring her understanding of the world to politics. That seemed to me very right. The exclusion of women is just unhealthy.""",2003,"Russia"

"118","Unholy Alliance","EECA","Some horrific events over the past few months, including the shooting of a Pakistani schoolgirl and the rape and murder of a young Indian physiotherapy student, should have been an alert for the world to unite in preventing violence against women. But if a conference now under way at the United Nations is any guide, that message has not resounded with the necessary urgency. Halfway into their two-week annual meeting, delegates to the Commission on the Status of Women fear they will not be able to agree on a final communiqué, just like last year. Who is to blame? Delegates and activists are pointing fingers at the Vatican, Iran and Russia for trying to eliminate language in a draft communiqué asserting that the familiar excuses -- religion, custom, tradition -- cannot be used by governments to duck their obligation to eliminate violence. The United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed similar language just six months ago. Conservative hard-liners seem determined to fight it out again. They have also objected to references to abortion rights, as well as language suggesting that rape also includes forcible behavior by a woman's husband or partner. Poland, Egypt, other Muslim states and conservative American Christian groups have criticized one or more parts of the draft. The efforts by the Vatican and Iran to control women are well known. It is not clear what motivates Russia, although there is a strong antifeminist strain in President Vladimir V. Putin's government. He may also be trying to curry favor with Islamic states. In any case, the suggestion that traditional values justify the violation of basic human rights is spurious. As Inga Marte Thorkildsen, Norway's gender equality minister, has noted, ''Violence against women must be seen as a human rights issue, and that has nothing to do with culture or religion.'' Gender-based violence is an epidemic. A World Bank report estimated that more women between the ages of 15 and 44 were at risk from rape and domestic violence than from cancer, car accidents, war and malaria combined. According to the United Nations and other sources, more than 600 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not considered a crime and more than 3 million girls are facing female genital mutilation. Women in all social, economic, ethnic and religious groups are affected. The conference will be a failure if it cannot produce ambitious global standards that will deliver concrete results to protect women and girls.",2013,"Russia"
"119","In Moscow, An Attempt To Wed Pushes Gay Rights","EECA","They knew they had no chance. But there they were anyway at a marriage registration office in Moscow on Tuesday. Two young women, wearing tuxedos and clutching bouquets, trying to become the first same-sex couple in Russia to legally wed. ''We have love, we have happiness, we want to be together for our whole lives and we want to do this here in Russia,'' said Irina Fedotova, who hoped to marry her longtime partner, Irina Shipitko. In a country where the push for gay rights has materialized only recently -- and in fits and starts often met with violence and arrests -- their  attempt to marry was a bold, if muted, political statement as much as it was an expression of love. The unsurprising response from the official at the registration office was dry and unequivocal. ''According to article 12 of the family codex, for a marriage to be sanctioned it is necessary to have the mutual and voluntary agreement of a man and a woman.'' Both women said they had expected their marriage application to be rejected and said they would appeal the decision. Their attempt to marry was meant in part to draw attention to gay rights in Russia as thousands of Europeans flood Moscow for the  Eurovision song contest. Gay rights groups  plan  a demonstration in Moscow Saturday, the day of the Eurovision final. In the past, such protests have been met with violent attacks by radical Orthodox Christian groups and neo-fascists. The police, who turn out to these events by the hundreds, are often slow to intervene. Yuri M. Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, has consistently refused to allow the demonstrations, referring to them as ''satanic acts.'' At an international AIDS conference in Moscow in December, he said he would continue to forbid the ''propaganda of sexual minorities because it could be a factor in the spread of H.I.V.,'' the Ria Novosti news agency reported. This  antipathy toward homosexuals among politicians and society  has forced many here to live in secrecy, and has stifled the formation of a large gay rights movement with legal teams, lobbyists and  grass-roots support as in Europe and the United States. In the past several years, however, Ms. Fedotova said she had noticed a slight increase in tolerance toward homosexuals in Russia, as more and more of them choose to live openly. ''In Moscow, specifically, gay society has received a minimal level of freedoms,'' Ms. Fedotova said. ''There are clubs and places to meet where you can find partners, but that is it.'' Ms. Fedotova, 30, and Ms. Shipitko, 32, have decided to marry in Canada, where they can do so legally, but said they would return to Russia  and hopefully serve as an example to other gay couples and to Russian society.",2009,"Russia"

"121","GREEK WOMEN GAIN IN ELECTION ROLE","EECA","Greece's women, statistically shown to be more socially and economically discriminated against than their counterparts in any other Western country, have mobilized to an extent that will make them a determining factor in next month's general elections. Awareness of their enhanced political role has led the parties to respond to demands by the National Council of Women for the inclusion of a far larger number of women than usual as candidates in the elections. And the wives of Prime Minister George Rallis and of the Socialist opposition leader, Andreas Papandreou, are campaigning throughout the country in a bid for the female vote, which accounts for 50.5 percent of the seven million elgible voters. About 250 female candidates, or more than 10 percent of the total, are running this time, compared with 103 in the last general election, in 1977, and 16 in 1958. Most will represent left-wing parties, reflecting the feminist complaint that their underprivileged position stems at least partly from rightist government. Prime Minister Rallis pledged yesterday that he would include women in his government if he wins the elections, but he said they themselves were partly to blame for their limited presence in politics. ''I don't believe women are less able but are just less inclined than men to participate in politics,'' he said. 10 Women in Parliament The present Parliament has 10 women among i ts 300 members, and though this is the largest number ever it is still the lowest proportion in Europe. The low participation of women is evident at all levels of Greek public life, as revealed by a conference on the issue held 10 months ago in Philadelphia by the American-based Modern Greek Studies Association. There are no women governors or executive directors in the large state-owned banks or public corporations. The first woman judge was appointed in 1959, and women now make up 17 percent of the total judiciary, but none are in the top echelons of the courts. The first women were accepted into the diplomatic corps in 1972, and today there are fewer than 20. Among the more than 200,000 public employees, women hold less than 1 percent of the highest posts but 61 percent in the lower ranks.  There have been no appointments of women as secretary generals of ministries and none as municipal prefects, and there have been only half a dozen female mayors. By law women are forbidden participation in councils of the Greek Orthodox Church, and few women find their way to the top of labor unions. Female Graduates Increase Their presence is more strongly felt in the private sector and the liberal professions, as well as in higher education, where female graduates increased from 23 percent to 38.6 percent of the total between 1960 and 1977. But of the 800,000 illiterates in Greece, 78 percent are women. George Psacharopoulos, of the London School of Economics, said at the Philadelphia conference that ''discrimination against females is still a dominant feature of the Greek labor market.'' His statistics showed that pay for women is on average less than two-thirds of pay for men and that women's depressed economic position has not improved over the last decade. Statistics published last year by the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that Greek women make up only 31.2 percent of the labor force, the lowest in the West. Spain follows with 32.5 percent, while Sweden has the highest female participation , 70 percent. The figure for the United States is 55.7 percent. The organization's figures showed that the average earnings of Greek women were 68 percent that of men, also the lowest in Europe.  West Germany and Italy registered 72 and 80 percent. Discrimination filters up to the political level. In the balconies of Parliament women visitors are kept separate from men. There are no women in the Cabinet or on the executive boards of the governing New Democracy Party or the opposition Socialists, though three of the 10 members of the board of the pro-Moscow Greek Communist Party are women. Greece is the only nation that does not have women among its 24 delegate to the European Parliament. Several Causes Cited Virginia Tsouderos, a Harvard-educated member of Parliament and a prominent women's rights campaigner, attributes the situation to the heavily patriarchal nature of Greek society, the traditionalist influence of the church and a social outlook that values a woman according to her subservience and housework abilities. She also points to the discriminating nature of the legal system, for Greece is the last European nation to maintain laws based on Roman-Byzantine law. It is the reaction against these laws that brought women to mobilize. The rallying point was a family law bill to put into effect equality of the sexes, as specified for the first time in the Constitution enacted in 1975. Parliament did not ratify the bill before recessing for the elections, but the legal changes already accepted by the Government include the abolition of the marriage dowry and of provisions naming the father as head of the family. Following guidelines adopted by the 21-nation Council of Europe, the bill establishes equality between parents in family decision-making and abolishes such provisions as those requiring a woman to have her husband's authorization to travel abroad with the children, to register them at school or to establish a private business.",1981,"Greece"
"122","Study Sees Setbacks for Polish Women","EECA","The democratic revolution that flushed communism from power in Poland has done nothing to root out sexism, according to a report by two American human rights groups. On the contrary, according to ""Hidden Victims: Women in Post-Communist Poland,"" discrimination against women has increased since the changes of 1989. ""While democracy takes one step forward in Poland, women take two steps back,"" says the report issued jointly this week by Helsinki Watch of New York and the Washington-based Women's Rights Project. The notion of equal rights for women has been tainted by four decades of fellow-traveling with communist ideology, the report says. ""Women's rights are often perceived as politically suspect and are frequently rejected along with the rest of the communist past."" Among the findings of ""Hidden Victims"": In a country weathering a severe recession, women, on average, are laid off before men and most offers for new jobs are for men only. There is no Polish law to stop or punish sex discrimination in hiring practices. When men and women apply for unemployment benefits in a Warsaw office building, they are segregated on separate floors. Child-support payments in Poland are not indexed to the cost of living. After nearly three post-Communist years of high inflation, some women receive monthly support payments of 50 cents per child. The minister of justice has the authority to correct this injustice overnight. He chooses not to do so. Day care was widely available and cheap under communism. Since 1989, more than half of all day-care centers have closed and others have become prohibitively expensive. Poland was singled out for study, the report says, because its economic and social reforms started earlier and are more advanced than the changes in other post-Communist countries in Eastern Europe.",1992,"Poland"
"123","From Proletarians to Pinups; In the New, Anti-Feminist Russia, Sexploitation Meets Mandatory Motherhood","EECA","""IN POST-COMMUNIST Russia,"" a Russian friend likes to say, ""there are only two images of women. Mother or whore."" I used to think she was exaggerating, but in the last year, more and more Russian women have told me that they feel trapped between a state-sponsored campaign for family values and a newly unfettered mass media that depicts women as sex objects for male consumption. The front line in the family values crusade is in the Russian Parliament. Sometime this spring, a motley crew of old-style conservatives and newfangled democrats is expected to pass a law that will strip women of economic and reproductive rights. In draft form, the Law on the Protection of the Family grants all rights to the family, which it defines narrowly as a ""cell"" in which there are children -- natural or adopted. Only the family, not individual members, can own an apartment or a house, a plot of land or a car. The law gives the family -- not women -- the right to decide how many children to have. Another provision proclaims ""the priority of the family is the upbringing of children,"" which will compel women to leave the workplace as day care centers close and other social services are slashed. ""In reading the draft law,"" a friend said, ""you come to the conclusion that the only thing a woman will be able to do in life is to fulfill the state-approved role of motherhood, since other opportunities for self-realization are denied her."" One ominous provision of the law declares that every child has the right to life from the moment of conception -- which many women believe is a step towards undermining Russia's liberal abortion law. The provision may have been spawned by government panic over the country's dramatically falling birthrate. Last year, for the first time since World War II, deaths in Russia exceeded births. ""How can one talk about democratic principles,"" asked Tatyana Khudyakova, a Russian journalist who writes about women's issues for Izvestia, ""if attempts are being made to deprive each one of us of the right to dispose of our body, housing or pay?"" Amid the grim realities of Russian life, the proposed law seems like yet another quixotic attempt to restore a mythic past -- in this case, where women stayed home to serve husband and children and divorce was rare. But in today's Russia, more than half of families with three or more children live in poverty, divorce rates are high and each year, some 700,000 fathers of children under a year old leave their wives. Every fifth Russian woman is the family's only breadwinner. While the law winds its way through the parliament, the Russian mass media promotes its own version of family values. Professional women, with very few exceptions, are characterized as anti-family. (""The most important thing women produce are children,"" the liberal newspaper Nedelya announced.) Newspapers embracing the political spectrum blame ""overemancipated, masculinized women"" for social ills from juvenile delinquency to divorce. At the same time, even the most respectable newspapers and magazines use photographs of naked women in the fierce circulation battles that characterize today's Russian press life today. ""In our press,"" sociologist Olga Voronina recently noted, ""women's faces and characters appear much less frequently than their bodies."" The 15-year-old daughter of a close friend recently confided that many of her classmates consider hard-currency prostitution a prestigious trade. After scanning several mainstream newspapers, I began to understand why. Last September, Komsomolskaya Pravda, a liberal paper with 8 million readers, featured an article promoting a new 24-hour call girl service for Western and Russian businessmen. The firm's young founder told the newspaper that his girls ""are between 18 and 30 years old, cost 10,000 rubles per hour or 25,000 rubles per night, and wear beautiful clothes."" (An average monthly salary in Moscow nowadays is about 5,000 rubles -- approximately $ 10 at present conversion rates.) Another popular newspaper, Moskovskii Komsomolets, regularly runs ads ""seeking young women without complexes for rich men."" And Evening Moscow, once favored by pensioners and soldiers, recently ran a story promoting the Miss Sex '92 contest. Photos of the topless contestants cuddling with doubles of Stalin, Lenin and Hitler were scattered across the front page. Family values weren't completely forgotten: The winner won an iron and a washing machine. Television, unconstrained by FCC-style regulations, is no exception. In December, Russia's Channel 2 showed an advertisement for a secretarial firm seeking women between the ages of 18 and 25. (Sexist and ageist job advertisements are common.) The ad showed a young woman and her boss dining at an elegant and intimate restaurant. ""Ease his business anxieties,"" a male announcer says, as the couple leaves the restaurant. Even television's so-called family hour is not off-limits. My daughter's favorite Sunday morning cartoons were followed by ""Miss Moscow Striptease '92."" The prize: a fur coat and a trip to Berlin. For Russian girls and young women in desperate financial need -- 80 percent of the unemployed are women -- the media's promotion of a lucrative and glamorous life through prostitution or other thinly disguised sexual services is seductive. A Russian sociologist, E. Rybina, predicted recently in the weekly newspaper Private Life that ""the current political and economic situation in this country will push many more women into prostitution. Certainly it is sad, but prostitution today is the highest paying profession for women.""  In some ways, Russian women face the same sexual stereotypes that American women confronted 30 years ago. Not surprisingly, more and more Russian women are forming activist and self-help groups -- from rape crisis centers in cramped apartments to women's studies programs in high-rise academic institutes. Although the Russian women's movement is small and disorganized, it is fast-growing, diverse and no longer confined to Moscow or St. Petersburg. In November, I attended the Second Independent Women's Forum in Dubna, two hours outside Moscow, where some 500 women braved freezing temperatures and the crippling cost of internal travel to network, agitate and organize. As Russian women introduced themselves to the conference participants, it was as if the whole of society were on stage -- from businesswomen to unemployed rural women, teachers, factory workers, doctors, politicians and even women veterans of the Afghan War. At the end, forum participants issued an appeal to the Russian Parliament, requesting that the hearing on the draft family law be postponed until ""the bill is finalized in accordance with the standards of international law and widely discussed by the general public."" With the cooperation of a few sympathetic deputies, women's groups in Moscow will hold a public hearing in the parliament next month to bring Russian and world attention to the law's discriminatory nature. On another front, several women who attended the forum have created a group to monitor and challenge sexism in the Russian press; they plan to meet with editors and reporters. ""We are not calling for a new kind of censorship,"" one of the organizers told me. ""We want some fairness and open-mindedness. In the current climate, we understand that calls for censorship of sexually explicit material and moral policing can be easily turned against women."" ""It seems to me,"" wrote a 15-year-old who attended the Dubna forum, ""that we women should not remain silent and close our eyes to what we see all around us . . . . We must begin, before it is too late, by actively fighting for our dignity, so that people understand that you cannot build a free society by degrading women."" The Russian political elite and mass media, overwhelmingly male and hostile to women's rights, would do well to heed her words. She is Russia's future.

"124","Marrying and Divorcing, Soviet-Style; New Views on Marriage, Role of Women Besiege Traditional Soviet Society","EECA","The idea that the Soviet Union is an exceptionally conservative society, in which changes take place at a snail's pace, if at all, is one to which most experts tend to subscribe. The secretiveness of the place, its aurthoritarian quality, and the apparently immutable symbols of Kremlin power all seem to produce a melancholy sense of time standing still. World War II is still the subject of daily radio and television shows and of films and books.  It is presented as one of the watersheds -- sometimes the watershed -- of human history, as though nothing has happened since. Yet the current public debate on the institution of marriage and the role of women reveals not only a generational change but also the deeper social and and economic problems emerging in this increasingly complex society. The fact that one in every three marriages in the Soviet Union ends in divorce within a year suggests something new and emancipated about Soviet women in contrast to their parents who submitted to traditional patterns. Another interesting statistic shows that at least one in five divorces in this country is phony, with partners seeking dissolution to obtain economic or other benefits while continuing to live together. Such manipulation of marriage, once the source of stability in Russian life, reflects growing consumer expectations and pressures in a centralized economy that somehow, despite great natural wealth, remains incapable of satisfying the needs of the population. The phony divorces involve both younger and older couples. One newspaper recently cited the following example: a couple married for more than 30 years was told that their home would be razed to make way for urban development.  They were offered a small, two-room apartment.  Their daughter was to be given an efficiency. The couple immediately filed for divorce.  Once the marriage was leagally dissolved, each was eligible for separate accommodations.  After some complex maneuverings and exchanges of apartments, they wound up a happy family again -- in a large apartment. The phony divorce is a device also used to gain residence permits.  Students from Siberia, for example, after completing their education in Moscow must leave the city unless they have residence papers.  The easiest and quickest way to do that is to get married, obtain residence papers and get divorced as if nothing had happened. But in most cases, a divorce is used to improve the couple's economic lot.  The husband and wife claim irreconcilable differences, have their marriage dissolved and then continue to live normal lives together while benefiting from the advantages accruing to divorced persons. The soaring divorce rate among newlyweds is a cause of considerable official concern.  With the population growth rate almost at zero, the family is needed not only as a basic unit in a stable society but also to raise children. But there is a beginning here of a feminist mood, despite the fact that the country's political and social life remains male-dominated.  Soviet women today are better educated and more career conscious than earlier generations.  They are also less willing to put up with the strong tradition of male chauvinism. Soviet men, in turn, have entered public polemics about the subject with letters and articles that display the enduring assumption of male superiority. lThat assumption lingers in folk sayings, such as ""a wife is not a jug -- she won't crack if you whack her"" or,""a dog is wiser than a woman -- he won't bark at his master."" One Moscow newspaper recently printed an article written by V. Petrovsky that concluded that divorce is ""economically advantageous"" for women.They keep the children and receive about $68 a month in alimony from the state for each child. By disposing of the husband,"" he said, ""she has less domestic chores to do."" Another writer explained his divorce in terms of his wife having ""turned my home into an office, constantly writing or reading or conducting business over the telephone.  She had no time to cook and shop."" Yet another writer added this clincher to a similar argument: ""It came to the point where my son had to do the shopping."" According to Russian tradition, housework is considered demeaning for men. There have been no passionate feminist response to these and similar statements. Officially, women enjoy full equality here.  In practice, they have to maintain the household, mind the children, wait in lines to buy food and hold a job.  The latter has become essential to maintaining living standards. One of the main reasons for divorces, apart from the increasing assertiveness of women, is the problem of drinking that is so widespread among men. Ads written in a lonely-heart style almost invariably refer to the issue. ""Interesting brunette, engineer phycist.  Wants to meet a person willing to start a family.  Anyone given to drink should not bother to make contact,"" reads a typical ad. A man described himself as having ""solid character, nondrinker"" and wanting to meet his future wife ""no children, not older than 27."" The lonely hearts columns in themselves are an innovation that reflects the increasing problems of loneliness and family instability.",1980,"Russia"
"125","Port-au-Prince Journal; Haiti Task Force, Battling for Women's Rights","LA","The elegant white building just across the square from the National Palace has long been a center of power here, and that is just fine with the women who have displaced the fearsome soldiers who once swaggered through its halls. In an act laden with symbolism, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has turned over the two-story French colonial-style house to the 50 or so women who now serve as the Ministry of Women's Affairs. It was with a mixture of pride and anxiety that the women took over the very offices where army officers plotted the overthrow of Mr. Aristide in September 1991. But since the President's return last October, the army has been dismantled. ""This building represents power in the Haitian mind,"" said Marjorie Michel-Kernisant, former president of the Haitian Women's Fund, a private group that provides money to women wanting to be entrepreneurs. ""When President Aristide gave this building to women, somehow it also meant that we women are in power."" The Minister for Women's Affairs, Lise-Marie Dejean, said: ""We consider it an honor that we are given this house. It was a place of death before, and now it is a place of life."" While many countries have government bureaus dedicated to women's issues, Haiti is one of the few to have a Cabinet-level ministry for them. Its creation came in November 1994, after years of lobbying and organizing by Haitian women, who have doubly suffered as the poorest members of what is already considered the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. The ministry is intended to act as a kind of well-placed advocacy group for the 3.5 million women who make up a little more than half of Haiti's population. If the Planning Ministry seeks aid money from abroad for a development project, for instance, the Women's Ministry is there to insure that women receive some of the jobs. The ministry says it will coordinate its efforts with the hundreds of private groups here that also work to better women's conditions. Even though women are generally regarded as the economic backbone of everyday life here, their contribution is seldom equally compensated. Nearly everywhere they can be seen laboring in mostly menial and manual jobs -- carrying water in buckets atop their heads, tending small farm plots, peddling produce. Women were barred from universities until 1939, and even today their legal and social standing generally remains below that of most Haitian men. The Constitution, for instance, calls for a woman to turn over all that she inherits to her husband; the legal code punishes women more severely than men if caught committing adultery; and the age of sexual consent is 18 years for boys, while for girls it is just 15. Abortion is illegal in this nominally Roman Catholic country. Fewer than 10 percent of women use birth control, according to studies by relief groups, and few women outside the capital have access to family planning. The average Haitian woman will bear six children, often at home without medical attention, and the death rate in childbirth is five times that of women in the United States. ""This ministry is the result of the women's struggle,"" said Ms. Dejean, the Women's Affairs Minister. ""It was not a gift."" Ministry officials have begun what they described as the first comprehensive study of the social and economic status of women in Haiti. The survey will try to compare women's wages with those of men, measure their strength in the paid work force and document the often unsanitary conditions women labor under in unregulated outdoor markets. The ministry, which has a yearly budget of about $1 million, out of a total Government budget of $300 million, has also started a program with the Agriculture Ministry to channel credit to women who are farmers, and it has set up a counseling program for victims of rape. But while many people here agree that opportunities for Haitian women should be improved, some have questioned the need for a ministry. The ministries of Justice and Social Affairs, they argue, are perfectly capable of handling the cause. ""This is reverse discrimination,"" said Dr. Kyss Jean-Mary, a New York-trained obstetrician and gynecologist, and critic of the Women's Ministry. ""Are they going to create a ministry for men's affairs? It's a cosmetic salon."" Whatever the criticism, the ministry has a strong champion in Mr. Aristide, who has several women among his closest advisers. Of his 18 Cabinet ministries, 4 are headed by women, including those for foreign affairs and finance. A record number of women are also expected to sit in the new 110-member Parliament that convenes this fall. After Mr. Aristide returned last year, the electoral code was changed to allow women to pay lower registration fees than men to to run for office. The number of women running for Parliament this year increased to 45 from 16 in 1990, when Mr. Aristide was elected. Until Haitians vote in run-off elections scheduled for Sept. 17, women's total representation will not be known. But their numbers are likely to increase from the three who were seated in the old 83-member Chamber of Deputies and the one in the 27-member Senate. In a play on words based on the initials of the ministry's former occupants, the Armed Forces of Haiti, or FADH, people have taken to calling the new ministry Fem Actionaises d'Haiti, which, loosely translated, means the Hard-Driving Women of Haiti.",1995,"Haiti"
"126","Slow to Yield, Brazil Passes Equal Rights For Its Women","LA","After 26 years of debate, amendments, delays and parliamentary maneuvering, the Brazilian Congress has approved a legal code that for the first time in the country's history makes women equal to men in the eyes of the law. Among the oddities the new measure eliminates is a much-criticized provision that allows a husband to obtain an annulment if he learns that his wife was not a virgin at the time of their marriage. The new code also does away with a restriction that prevents anyone determined to have engaged in adultery, which is a criminal offense here, from remarrying. As feminist groups see it, though, the most significant advance is the abolition of the traditional concept of ""paternal power,"" which gives Brazilian fathers unrestricted legal rights to make all decisions on behalf of their families. Under the new legislation, they will have to divide that authority with their wives, and single mothers will be regarded as heads of households. ""The most discriminatory features of the old code have been removed, and there is very powerful symbolism in that,"" said Solange Bentes Jurema, president of the National Council for Women's Rights, one of the country's leading feminist organizations. ""The family is no longer an institution that is the property of the man, but a union in which all members have responsibilities and duties."" In banner headlines, some Brazilian newspapers hailed congressional approval of the new code on Wednesday as signifying ""the burial of machismo"" in Latin America's largest country. But others described the legislation as a long overdue example of ""law catching up with social customs,"" which is also the evaluation favored by most feminists. ""These are important advances, and we have reason to celebrate,"" said Jacqueline Pitanguy, a sociologist and prominent women's rights advocate here. ""But we also have to ask: What took so long?"" Despite Brazil's image abroad as a liberal and even libertine nation, social legislation has typically been quite conservative, reflecting that with 175 million people, it is the largest Roman Catholic country in the world. Divorce, for instance, was legalized only in 1978, and abortion in all but the most limited of circumstances remains illegal. The new legislation replaces a 1916 statute that formally enshrined the hierarchical, patriarchcal view of family and sexual relations that prevailed here and elsewhere in Latin America at the time. Brazil's current Constitution, ratified in 1988, guarantees sexual equality for women, but many judges have continued to make rulings based on the outdated civil code because Congress was unable, ever since one was first introduced in 1975, to pass a revised statute. ""The old code reflected an agrarian, 19th-century society,"" said Ricardo Fiuza, a legislator from a conservative rural state who was the chief sponsor of the measure. ""This one now reflects modern society and values."" As part of the effort to eliminate bias on the basis of sex, which includes substituting human being or person for the word man, the code also promises some new protections for men. The legislation, which has more than 2,000 articles, is not expected to go into effect fully until 2003, because laws to carry out the provisions still must be written or revised. ""A hundred years would not be enough to discuss so many themes,"" said Mr. Fiuza, who nonetheless described the measure as ""a good result"" and ""the greatest political honor that has ever fallen to me."" Ms. Pitanguy said: ""This new civil code is a blow to machismo and a victory for women, but you don't bury machismo so easily, with just some changes in the law. Machismo is a way of looking at the world that is deeply embedded in the hearts of both men and women, and that is much more difficult to change.""",2001,"Brazil"
"127","Gaps in Women's Rights Are Cited","LA","PARIS -- Most countries still do not explicitly criminalize rape within marriage, according to a sweeping United Nations report of global women's rights published Wednesday. The report also found that more than half of working women lack basic legal protections on the job. Gender equality is increasingly enshrined in laws, but many millions of women still have no access to justice, said Michelle Bachelet, the former president of Chile who was appointed as executive director of U.N. Women, the global body's first agency for gender equality and female empowerment, which published the report. ''We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go,'' she said. ''And even where the laws exist, the implementation and enforcement of those laws can be poor -- even in the most progressive countries.'' The rate at which rape and sexual violence cases are reported remains low, she said. In 57 countries, the report showed, one in 10 women say they have been victims of sexual aggression, but only 11 percent of those women go to the police. ''Women are three times more likely to report a robbery than sexual assault,'' said Laura Turquet, chief author of the report. ''In many countries the victim still feels more stigmatized than the perpetrator.'' Rape as a weapon of war -- in some cases with the aim not just to terrorize and displace whole populations but to spread disease -- has become part of modern conflict, she said. Among countries that have still not formally outlawed domestic violence are two members of the European Union -- Hungary and Lithuania -- and among those still not explicitly criminalizing marital rape are a dozen more, including pioneers of gender equality like Norway and Britain. ''This is always very surprising for all of us who work on women's rights issues,'' Ms. Turquet said. ''Many of the problems women face, for example with violence, are the same in rich and poor countries.'' The report offered several recommendations, including enactment of legislation to provide equal-pay rights and paid maternity leave, and making legal complaints filed by victims of violence and discrimination easier and more affordable. In Cambodia, for example, bringing a rape charge involves a medical test that costs the equivalent of two weeks' wages. In Kenya, inheritance claims cost as much as $800 and involve navigating 17 administrative steps. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",2011,"Chile"
"128","EQUALITY DISRUPTS NICARAGUAN HOMES","LA","''My husband couldn't stand it,'' said Antonia Membreno Diaz, a 38-year-old mother of five from a poor neighborhood in Managua. ''After the revolution he made me choose between him and the Women's Association. When I chose the organization he walked out. We'd been together 20 years.'' Silvia Reyes, a leader of the nationwide Women's Association, has also seen her marriage destroyed by politics in recent months. ''We separated for ideological reasons,'' the 30-year-old organizer explained. ''I had to choose between my home and my ideology.'' In contrast, Marta-Isabel Barrios and her husband both work for the new Government but see little of their two children. ''They are suffering, I know,'' she said. ''I leave home at 5:30 A.M. and don't get back until 8 P.M. They spend the day with the maid or their grandmother and are being taught values that are out of harmony with our times.'' The shock waves sent out by the revolution last year have had a dramatic impact on family life in Nicaragua. The formation of the semiofficial Women's Association and the revolution's decree of sexual equality have served to undermine traditional male domination of Nicaraguan society. Relationships Collapse Angela Saballos, a 35-year-old divorced woman who recently founded Ya Veremos, a monthly political magazine, said: ''The revolution was like an earthquake. Unbalanced relationships collapsed.'' Although sexual equality has been formally decreed, the Government's emphasis so far has been on involving women in the revolutionary process rather than on promoting specific women's rights. For example, the Women's Association uses its 30,000 members mainly to organize educational, political and social welfare activities. However, there is an undisguised struggle for women's rights by well-educated women working for the Government or related organizations. ''There is still a lot of machismo,'' Silvia Reyes said. ''Some men feel more macho just because they wear a Sandinist uniform. Others were happy to see their companions fighting against the Somoza dictatorship but wanted them back home when the war ended.'' A Revolutionary Role The involvement of women in the final stages of the Sandinist insurrection against Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle was significant, both in support activities and in combat. The Women's Association, for example, replaced a women's group that helped organize urban slums for the final rebel offensive in the summer of 1979. While many women are in the army and the Government, relatively few hold senior positions. At present there is no woman among the five members of the governing junta or the nine members of the Sandinist National Directorate. Only one woman is in the Cabinet, the Minister of Health, Lea Guido de Lopez. Nicaragua's new Ambassador to Washington, though, is a woman, 29-year-old Rita Delia Casco. ''The main reason is that the general cultural level of women is low,'' said Silvia Reyes. ''Before this year's literacy campaign, we found that 71 percent of all illiterates were women. Families would prefer to educate their sons because they would have to look after the family. Even among the bourgeoisie, women didn't have the same opportunities.'' Female orga nizers recognize that it may take years to change malefemale re lationships among the poor. ''There are more urgent problems than feminist rights,'' said Judith Saravia, who works amongManagua's urb an squatters. ''Women are worried about such basics as food, clothes and education, and that's what we have to concentrate on. For examp le, we're trying to help unmarried mothers, but as a social proble m, not as a feminist issue.'' Union for Maids One unusual effort has been the formation o f a union for maids. It already has about 1,800 members in Managua. H owever, widespread unemployment and the constant flow of rural t een-age girls to urban areas in search of work complicate efforts to enforce a maximum working day of 14 hours and a wage that excee ds the current legal minimum of $30 a month. Some efforts have been made to help change male attitudes toward women. For example, advertising that uses women to sell products unrelated to them has been forbidden. ''You don't need a woman in a bikini to sell tires, do you?'' argued Silvia Reyes. There is resistance to change, however, even among male revolutionaries. ''Theoretically, they say no to machismo, possessiveness and domestic repression,'' Milu Vargas, a 29-year-old Government lawyer, said. ''But in practice things are more difficult. They still have to assimilate the changes. They accept equality for other women, but not for their own companion.'' The resulting male-female clashes, aggravated by political disagreements, have brought a sharp rise in the number of separations and divorces since the fall of the Somoza regime. Many new relationships have formed and the birth rate has jumped. ''After the war people saw pregnancy as a declaration of life, a celebration of survival,'' a Roman Catholic priest said. 'We're Revaluing Ourselves' Perhaps the biggest change is the new confidence evident in many women who had been overshadowed by their husbands. ''Women feel they have their own personality now,'' Angela Saballos said. ''We're revaluing ourselves, wanting independence, wanting to be persons. And of course not all husbands can tolerate this. That's why we also need male liberation.'' A few women, though, have found that their spouses are able to adapt.  ''My husband used to complain that I was always out at meetings,'' recalled Norma Ortiz, a 52-year-old grandmother and Women's Association volunteer. ''But one day I managed to persuade him to get involved in the revolution. Now he's the best organizer in the barrio and there are no more problems at home.''",1980,"Nicaragua"
"129","FOR WOMEN OF MEXICO, A NEW POLITICAL BEACON","LA","IT seems an unwritten rule the world over that candidates for elected office are expected to kiss babies, shake hands and sometimes sacrifice their dignity. But when Beatriz Paredes Rangel, who at the age of 33 is soon to become the second woman to serve as Governor of a Mexican state, was asked recently during the election campaign to stand inside a giant clay Mexican cooking pot called a cazuela, she politely demurred. Ms. Paredes encountered the cazuela among a display of dozens of smaller pots at a campaign meeting of native artists from throughout the state of Tlaxcala that she had organized here. One of the elders of the village where the pots are made stood in the cazuela and rocked back and forth, demonstrating how strong it was. Then he stepped out and beckoned the Governor-to-be to climb into the pot and see for herself. Certainly any male Mexican gubernatorial candidate would have hopped right in and happily rocked to and fro, winning votes and fostering his image as one of the boys. For a fleeting moment, Ms. Paredes seemed about to raise her skirt and climb in, too. But she abruptly changed her mind, diverted attention with a question and the moment passed. Had she stood in the pot, Mexico's small contingent of activist feminists as well as socially aware women in general would have been disappointed. To many, Ms. Paredes' candidacy in a country where women were not allowed to vote until 1953 is a symbol of how life for Mexican women is slowly changing for the better and how it might change even more. ''Beatriz is a special phenomenon,'' said Elena Urrutia, coordinator of an interdisciplinary women's studies program at the Colegio de Mexico here and one of the founders of ''Fem.,'' Mexico's feminist magazine. ''Her accomplishments are very important to us because she is so young and rose from humble origins.'' Her origins make Ms. Paredes special for many women. Her father, now 86, is a campesino, or poor farmer, in Tlaxcala, where Ms. Paredes was born in 1953. Although she lacks the substantial family connections that usually are necessary for political success in Mexico, Ms. Paredes has risen to a position of power in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. Her admirers, colleagues and critics all agree she has done it on her own. Ms. Paredes, who is not married, describes herself as a natural leader, an assessment with which her colleagues agree. As a schoolgirl in a poor Tlaxcalan village, she showed flair as an orator, organizer and general spark plug in school life. She naturally gravitated to politics. ''We Tlaxcalans like to talk,'' she recalled. ''It all came very naturally to me.'' As a teen-ager she became deeply involved in the problems of the campesino organizations and the affairs of the ruling political party, known from its initials as the P.R.I. By the time she was 21, she was a member of the Tlaxcala State Legislature. Since then she has earned a college degree as a sociologist, served as a member of the Federal Chamber of Deputies, was a subminister in the Ministry of Agrarian Reform, and is a power in national campesino affairs. Ms. Paredes has token opposition from the candidates of three other parties in the election Nov. 16. But because the P.R.I. dominates Mexican political affairs, her designation last summer as the party's candidate for Governor of Tlaxcala assured that she would assume the post. Ms. Paredes avoids answering when asked if she is a feminist. Clearly, she is a politician first and foremost. To say she is not a feminist would look wrong to activist women who identify with her. To declare herself a feminist would risk alienation of powerful, traditionalist male politicians upon whose support she must depend as she moves up the political ladder. Instead, she is quick to stress her interest in improving the lives of all people. She is, however, what Mrs. Urrutia calls a ''sensitized'' woman, aware of women's problems. ''There are many women who come to positions of power and forget that 99 per cent of women are not in such positions,'' said Mrs. Urrutia. She cited a conference for women that Ms. Paredes held recently in Tlaxcala: ''She arranged child care for the women attending. Such a thought would never have occurred to a man.'' When Mexico's fledgling feminist movement began to emerge in the 1970's, it was class conscious. Its proponents were of the upper and middle classes. Their concern was focused on abortion, which is illegal in Mexico, rape, pornography and lesbianism. Unnoticed was the plight of the women of the lower classes, particularly of the campesino families, who struggle daily with a lack of drinkable water, inadequate housing and sanitary facilities, poor access to education for their children, unavailability of birth control information and a social order in which Latin machismo is still a dominant force. At the same time a steady deterioration of the Mexican economy that began in the 1970's and has been accelerating rapidly since the Mexican debt crisis emerged in 1982 has had a profound effect on the women of Mexico. Women who were traditionally housewives now must seek work outside the home to help their families survive. Although figures vary, sociologists and labor experts believe that in the last 10 to 15 years the proportion of women in the national work force has doubled, to about 30 percent from 15 percent. More than 80 percent of all women who study a profession in school are believed to enter the work force. As a result, the Mexican woman's role in society is shifting rapidly and the nature of Mexican feminism has broadened to embrace the changes. But despite rapid social changes, Mexico remains a rigidly patriarchal society. Politics is still a male dominion, particularly in an essentially one-party system where results at the ballot box have less meaning than do deals cut at party offices. Ms. Paredes knows she cannot sound too preoccupied with women's issues, too strident about the need for change. She chooses her words carefully. ''The country is living in a transition period in the ways that women participate in society,'' she said. ''There is a whole society that has established roles and, at the same time, there is a new presence of professional women, of working women. Roles are changing. Government policies must recognize this.'' She cites Government programs created in recent years to provide child care centers for working mothers as an example. Discussing politics, she is careful not to use the word discrimination, speaking of a ''series of areas where it is considered that women have less experience and less aptitude.'' There are male politicians, she said, who are very determined to push women forward and respect the participation of women in political matters, but there are other men who have reservations. ''But if you consider that we barely have 12 to 15 per cent representation in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, you can see that we do not have all the favorable conditions that are required,'' she said. But slowly, the situation is changing, both socially and politically. ''It is in transformation because of the economic situation in the country, and because of the large number of young women who went to school and are demanding that they participate in the productive plant, in public life,'' Ms. Paredes said. The first woman to serve as Governor of a Mexican state was Griselda Alvarez, who became Governor of Colima on the Pacific coast in 1979. Her great grandfather had been Colima's first Governor and her father had served as Governor, too. ''She was eminently qualified to be Governor,'' said one feminist here, who asked not to be identified. ''But she became Governor because the men in power looked around and said, 'It's time Mexico had a woman Governor.' They were filling a quota.'' State governors serve a single six-year term. When Mrs. Alvarez took office she was in her 60's. When Ms. Paredes leaves office, she will be only 39. ''Her youth means dynamism, initiative, projection,'' said Mrs. Alvarez. ''Her youth means many things, a permanent state of revolution.''",1986,"Mexico"
"130","WOMEN IN JOURNALISM: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE","LA","Lesley Stahl of CBS News told a skeptical woman from West Germany that yes, she could balance a child and a career in journalism. Christiana Chamorro, a Nicaraguan editor, said the central problem for female journalists in her country was not sexual discrimination, but freedom of the press. And Vesna Prlja, a Yugoslav journalist, urged women to free themselves from the ''superwoman'' myth. ''I have never met a man in my life who felt badly because he wasn't an ideal husband and an ideal father and extraordinarily successful at his career,'' she said. About 100 female journalists from 39 countries moved seamlessly among the personal, the professional and the political this week at the International Women's Media Conference. The three-day gathering, which ended today, highlighted the commonality of many concerns among female journalists, but also, at times, showed a striking difference in priorities. Female journalists from around the world talked about the difficulty of rearing children while pursuing careers. ''I have just come from a parents' conference at my kid's school,'' Ms. Stahl said, opening a panel discussion on the subject Friday morning. But a journalist from Turkey said, ''Women in the fields do much more work than one can imagine,'' and concluded, ''When we come to look at ourselves, I think we exaggerate a little bit our roles and our responsibilities.'' The role of gender in determining job opportunities was another area of intense discussion. Margaret Gallagher, an Irish researcher and consultant, said progress had been slower for women in European television than widely believed. ''There has been no amazing revolution in the participation of women in television over the past 10 years,'' she said. Ms. Gallagher ended her speech with a question: ''Why should we draw back from giving and receiving special treatment? After all, men have had a monopoly on it for too long.'' Some speakers suggested that women in journalism were no longer as likely to address women's issues in their coverage, or to push for the advancement of women in their industry, as they once were. ''In a way, we do want to fit in,'' said Cathleen Black, publisher of USA Today. ''We don't want to be labeled as a troublemaker.'' Other delegates brought a different perspective. ''The fascination with the gender gap is particularly American, I think,'' said Suhaini Aznam, Malaysian bureau chief for The Far Eastern Economic Review. ''It is a luxury of a country that has solved a lot of the problems of information flow and access to information.'' Ms. Chamorro, editor of the editorial page of La Prensa, which was recently ordered closed by the Sandinista Government, said the fundamental issue for female journalists in Nicaragua was not equality of opportunity. ''Unfortunately, the opportunities are for women who work for the Government, the party,'' said Ms. Chamorro, daughter of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Cardenal, the newspaper publisher who was assassinated in 1978. The conference was held with assistance from the United States Information Agency and corporate and foundation sponsors. About half the delegates came from the United States, and half from 38 other countries.",1986,"Nicaragua"
"131","Cairo Journal; For Women Only: A Train Car Safe From Men","MENA","When the idea was first put into effect on Cairo's rapid transit system, some said it would mean the creation of a kind of harem on wheels. Others said it just wouldn't work. But, two months later, according to the authorities, a plan to set aside one car on each train in the subway solely for women is making notable gains in protecting women from one of Cairo's unrelenting perils, sexual harassment of women by men on overcrowded public transport. Built in the late 1980's at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, the Cairo subway is one of the city's few obvious success stories: it works, it is generally clean and it is quiet - attributes not usually associated with the Egyptian capital, or with rapid transit in many other places. ''It is a sign of civilization, and matchless in the Middle East,'' proclaimed The Egyptian Gazette, an English-language paper. Indeed, the system, which runs from north to south, mostly above ground although it ducks briefly below the city center, is said to be the only one of its kind in the Middle East and all Africa. City of Traffic Torment The line was opened in 1987, linking three miles of subway to existing above-ground tracks, part of a project designed to provide a 26-mile link along the East Bank of the Nile. Created largely with French aid, it has cost $370 million so far. By the time it is complete, the whole project should cost $560 million. Its first years in operation, however, have been ambiguous. In impoverished Egypt, the 10-cent fare for an average inner-city ride is roughly three times the bus fare. And, while it offers passengers much speedier transit, it has not yet noticeably achieved its aim of drastically reducing traffic above ground, which continues in a state of permanent tangle. When the subway opened, it was estimated that each day a half million cars, cabs and minibuses competed above ground with 2,300 buses and a tram line for space on streets filled with millions of pedestrians in the largest city to be found in Africa or the Middle East. The subway was supposed to reduce above ground traffic by 75 percent. Since then, however, traffic congestion has gotten worse, even though the subway carries an estimated 20,000 commuters in each direction every hour from early morning until late at night. And it is guarded by a special police unit that keeps the stations free of litter-droppers, muggers, vandals or scrawlers of graffiti. The Place of Women Lately, the subway police have assumed another task: telling men not to board the first car of any train. The segregation of the subway cars is part of a larger issue about the difficult position of those Egyptians who seek a new status for women in a society that is being pushed toward an older doctrine of female subservience by a revival of Islamic fervor. ''Nasser gave women the vote'' in 1956, said Mona Makram-Ebeid, a senior member of the opposition Wafd party. ''Now, with this obscurantist movement, women are keen on keeping what advantages they have.'' ''The Islamic movement makes the accusation that women are invading public space and should be at home with their children,'' she said. ''It argues that the women's place is not in public life, not to be seen but to be a specator.'' The Debate Rages Such complaints are becoming increasingly frequent among well-educated women, responding to male assertions that women going to work are a prime source of congestion on public transport and joblessness among men. But the segregated subway cars offer a more abstract issue: to what extent should women be given greater rights than men to protect them from male misbehavior in what is still a male-dominated society. ''Since women have called for equality with men in all spheres of life, it is natural that she should fight like him for an empty seat,'' The Egyptian Gazette said in an article setting out the debate. Thuraya Labna, a feminist member of the Egyptian Parliament, who is credited with first proposing the idea of a segregated car, maintained that levels of sexual harassment were so high on public transport that women needed safe places to travel. Return to Segregation? But that drew a response from another commentator in The Egyptian Gazette, who said segregation in subway cars ''pulls us back to the dark ages of segregation and even humiliates our women, treating them as weak and subordinate.'' Down below ground, the verdict, apparently, is not yet in. As a train drew into a station in Cairo's city center recently, a newswoman joined the women in the segregated car, and took a sampling of opinion. ''I think it is a very nice idea,'' said a woman in the distinctive attire of rural Egypt. ''But we were never harassed on the Metro like we were on the buses.'' The buses, where travelers have as much space as sardines in a can, are much cheaper than the subway, but riding them can be very unpleasant, many women say. A friend then contributed to the debate, saying that the trains stop at each station for such a brief period that the most any passenger, male or female, can hope to do is to scramble for a seat, in whatever car is available. Complaints From Men Then, a male reporter took a sampling in one of the eight non-segregated cars. Maybe it was fine for unaccompanied daughters and wives to be protected, some men said. But how come, the reporter was asked, men couldn't use the segregated car - even when it was empty - and had to cram into the other non-segregated cars while women could use any of them? Mohammed Mabrouk Abu el Einin, the subway's Head of Operations, had his own views. ''We are the ones who initiated the idea of seeking the comfort of our women, and I think we were right,'' he said. ''I think the idea is a success. You can go down the Metro and see that the women's cars are always full of women. I think the percentage of success is about 90 per cent,'' he continued. ''What is said about a harem on wheels is not true. We only seek the comfort of our daughters and wives.''",1990,"Egypt"
"132","The World Over, Women's Progress Is Uneven","MENA","To the Editor: In any assessment of human rights in the Middle East, the rights of women must be taken into account. While one of your correspondents in Baghdad in early June referred to Iraq as ""a land whose human rights record is among the worst in the Middle East,"" another reported from Baghdad in early May: ""Under the secular rule of President Hussein's Baath Party, women have come to have more freedom in Iraq than almost anywhere else in the Arab world."" The earlier article notes that of 250 members of the Iraqi parliament, 15 are women. Iraqi women dress as they please and worry that multiparty democracy might empower an Islamic group to put them under the veil. Backing up this report is the Central Intelligence Agency's 1990 World Fact Book, which describes Iraqi suffrage as ""universal adult at age 18,"" Kuwait's as limited to ""adult males who resided in Kuwait before 1920 and their male descendants at age 21,"" and Saudi Arabia's as ""none."" The Persian Gulf war has not changed this. Note too, that by population, almost twice as many females attended primary school in Iraq as in Kuwait and three times as many as in Saudi Arabia, according to a United Nations report. Since we bombed Iraq mercilessly for the sake supposedly of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, it makes no sense for those countries to deny their women rights at least equal to those of Iraqi women.

"133","Teheran Journal; From the Back Seat in Iran, Murmurs of Unrest","MENA","Women in Iran ride in the back of the bus. They are banned from studying mechanics or electrical engineering, from traveling in the country without their husbands or fathers and from serving as judges because Islamic clerics call them too emotional. It is nearly impossible for a woman to initate divorce proceedings against her husband or to win custody of her children. By law, a woman's testimony in court is not given equal weight to a man's, and during the recent Iranian New Year women received 25 percent less than their male colleagues in annual bonuses. But slowly women are beginning to openly challenge the system that gives preferential treatment to men in hiring, promotions, university placement, pensions, family life and the legal system. With soaring inflation and low salaries, women who years ago could rely on the incomes of their husbands or fathers are leaving the kitchens and taking whatever employment they can find, from low-paying clerical positions to better-paying prostitution. Dozens Run for Parliament Dozens of women ran for seats in the Parliament in the April 10 elections, and a number were among the top vote-getters in their constituencies, including a gynecologist from the religiously conservative city of Mashad. And Iran's lively press has become an open forum for complaints about the plight of women. ""One of the main reasons women are seeking work is because of the economic problems; the other is to grow and learn more,"" said Shahla Sherkat, editor of Zanan, a new magazine for women whose most recent issue included a short story by the South African writer Nadine Gordimer and articles on back problems and quick cuisine. ""Professional opportunities are not provided as frequently for women. Officials must be told that women can hold high office. The impression is that women work less than men, but I believe it's the other way around."" The first issue of the magazine featured an article by an independent researcher on women's employment that stated that in 1989 only 5 percent of the professional jobs in Iran were held by women. In the second issue, now on the newsstands, Dr. Jaleh Shadi-Talab, a sociologist at Teheran University, says in an article on women in the Civil Service that they make up only 12 percent of the force. She adds, ""Women have been rejected from administrative positions, and increasingly the most suitable and best environment for women of any educational level has become the home."" Even women whose careers have soared with the revolution complain about discrimination. Fatemeh Karrubi, the 44-year-old director of the powerful Martyrs' Foundation Hospital Center, and her husband, Mehdi Karrubi, the Speaker of the Parliament, both of them so-called hard-line candidates for Parliament who fared poorly in the April 10 election, have been criticized recently in the press for the lavish wedding they gave for one of their children. But the press expended extra ammunition on Mrs. Karrubi. ""Couldn't you find anyone more qualified than your own wife to run the Martyrs' Foundation so that at least she would have less contact with strange men?"" an interviewer from the hard-line newspaper Resalat asked Mr. Karrubi, a mid-ranking cleric, in an interview last month. Mr. Karrubi snapped back, ""I don't expect a Muslim to hold such a view about women."" President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani tried to respond to women's complaints recently by naming a biologist, Fatima Hashemi, as his special adviser on women. But her office has not yet had much of an effect. Mr. Rafsanjani incurred the wrath of many women when he implicitly endorsed temporary marriage in a sermon in 1990. He justified the practice on the ground that young people did not have enough money to pay for a proper Persian wedding, and also suggested that it would not be un-Islamic for widows or divorced women to ""have a temporary relationship -- a temporary marriage -- with someone else.""  Prostitution in Comeback In the early years of the revolution, prostitutes were sent to prison or Islamic reform schools. But prostitution has made a comeback, and his sermon gave impetus to an already growing call-girl business. The world's oldest profession is practiced largely in the form of ""sigheh,"" the Islamic practice by which a couple can get married for a few years or months, or, if the rules are stretched, a few hours. ""I don't think sigheh should have been recommended for young people,"" Mrs. Karrubi said in an interview. ""To establish a permanent foundation for marriage it must be a permanent marriage, not a temporary one."" The most visible battle for women's rights is still fought through their wardrobes. In the 13-year revolution, perhaps no other issue has been debated with such fury as the rules for what constitutes ""good hejab,"" or head covering. ""Research proved female hair had a kind of radiance"" that might tempt men, Iran's first President under the revolution, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, said in the early days of the Islamic republic, and in the years that followed, women were insulted, arrested, fined and even lashed for ""bad hejab."" Last year, the dreaded Komitehs, the patrols that roamed the streets in search of bare ankles and wrists, were merged with the police force. And since then the dress code has eased. But women are still subjected to street harassment, and at the Laleh Hotel, the former Inter-Continental, in central Teheran, the waiters still get nervous when more than a few strands are showing, handing out little cards that read, ""Dear Sister, following Islamic laws helps keep the place of women in society so high -- please respect the rules and let us have the pleasure of serving you.""",1992,"Iran"
"134","Saudi Woman Who Fled Predicts Crackdown","MENA","The Saudi woman just granted asylum in Canada because of her fears of persecution at home for her feminist beliefs predicts that there will be increasing repression of Saudi women because of the growing strength of religious fundamentalism in that country. ""The situation will become more and more unbearable, and then it will explode because the condition of repression of human beings can't continue forever,"" said the woman, who is 24 and has been in hiding for 21 months. She spoke in a telephone interview from Montreal. Saudi restrictions on women are based both on the Koran and on conservative Arab traditions. Women are not allowed to mix with men in any public or work place. A woman must be veiled in public and is forbidden to travel alone or to drive a car. Islamic militancy has been on the rise throughout the Middle East, with proponents challenging practically every state. Although the Saudi royal family has been pushing strongly to modernize the country, it has had to do so carefully. Many analysts say religious influence there has increased in recent months. The young woman requested that her name not be published for fear of reprisals against her parents, who are in Saudi Arabia. While still in that country, she tried to go outdoors without the veil, to travel alone and to pursue a university education in the field of her choice. She spoke of how she resented the constraints in Saudi Arabia, where ""you have to have permission of a man when you want to study, go to a friend's house, work, travel, everything,"" and this resentment, she said, gave rise to her ""feminist images."" She arrived in Canada in April 1991, seeking to further her education and to work eventually in women's counseling. She had to go into hiding, however, after an appeal for refugee status on grounds of sexual discrimination was denied, a decision that made her an illegal immigrant. She has lived on money from her family. That rejection was overturned Jan. 29 after Bernard Valcourt, the Minister of Employment and Immigration, intervened as part of a landmark change in Canada's immigration rules. Ottawa is drawing up guidelines, expected to be ready within the next month, under which it would grant refugee status to women who can show persecution as a result of their sex. The change potentially would open up Canada to abused women from many countries who are not protected by the laws of their homelands. The young woman, who speaks English fluently but who has not yet learned the French of Montreal, acknowledged that ""relatively few"" women in Saudi Arabia share her views. Those who do capture headlines, such as the 70 veiled women who dismissed their drivers in front of a Riyadh supermarket in November 1990, and drove off in a protest against driving restrictions. They were stopped and detained by the police. The women, educated and from prominent families, were released after signing a pledge never to repeat the action. The young woman said she was out of the country at that time. Saudi Arabia's great wealth and the lack of any pressing need for women to work are among forces that keep women down in that country, she believes. ""The way we are wealthy is different from the U.S.,"" she said. ""I think in the U.S. and other countries the women's movement and the economy have grown at the same time, but for us there has been no change in the mentality because there is no incentive for women to participate in public life. We let the men abuse us because we don't know any better."" She was sharply critical of most Saudi men, who, she said, ""treat women as mindless all the time."" She acknowledged, though, that some Saudi men are sympathetic. ""In the Government there are a few men who are understanding,"" she said. ""But the situation is getting worse because the fundamentalism is increasing, and I think these conditions will continue for quite a few years.""",1993,"Saudi Arabia"

The Islamic Affairs Ministry will start the service in November in cooperation with independent counselors for women suffering verbal, physical, sexual or mental abuse, the English-language Arab Times said. Altaf al-Sultan, a psychotherapist involved with the project, was quoted as saying that there were no statistics on violence against women in Kuwait but that the creation of the hot line would help in the collection of data. Unlike women in neighboring Saudi Arabia, Kuwaiti women may drive and wear Western clothes, and they occupy top posts in the civil service, the oil industry and education. But they are not permitted to vote and, as in some other Arab countries, they lack equality with men on a range of issues. Haya al-Mughni, a sociologist writing a separate article in The Arab Times today, said: ""It is part of our culture to discipline women and keep them in their place.

""He was never allowed to go there, but I have -- to the promised land of equality,"" Dr. Nevo said yesterday during a visit to New York. In 1990, Dr. Nevo was successful in her legal challenge to the Israeli law that compelled women to retire at the age of 60, while men could continue to work to 65. Dr. Nevo, a sociologist, had worked for the Jewish Agency, the quasi-governmental body that oversees Jewish immigration to Israel, for 24 years, and directed researchers in its rural settlement department. She learned about the retirement law when she was 58. ""It never occurred to me that I couldn't go on working forever,"" she said. ""I was simply flabbergasted."" She filed a lawsuit against the agency in 1984 in Israel's Labor Court, and two years later the court ruled against her. ""I was forced out on my pension, but I wouldn't take the pension because I immediately appealed to the National Labor Court,"" she said. That decision went against her, too, so she filed an appeal with the High Court of Justice, which in 1990 reversed the lower courts. ""That finished off discrimination against women,"" she said. ""Now men and women have the same retirement age."" On Wednesday, Dr. Nevo was honored by US/Israel Women to Women, an organization that helped finance her legal battle, at a luncheon at Tavern on the Green. She received a check for $5,000, which she plans to use to continue to fight for women's rights in Israel.

"138","MIDEAST TENSIONS; An Outcry From the Saudis' Liberal Minority","MENA","A day after 70 women openly challenged the ban on driving by women, it is still not clear whether their move was a giant stride for Saudi society. But like the major turning points -- the introduction of telephones, of radio and television, the education of girls -- it was a forceful and dramatic challenge by a growing Saudi liberal minority in the face of a stern religious establishment that draws its power from the larger conservative majority. The hope of the liberal minority now is that women's rights, including the right to drive, have been placed on the agenda of the Saudi social contract between the rulers and the ruled, as an item for serious consideration. ""In this country, you've got to think of us, the liberals, as the silent minority coming out of its shell,"" a political science professor said. Traditionalists Are Less Timid ""While the religious establishment has a well-established tradition of fighting loudly for its views, we have been a timid bunch advancing in small steps,"" he said. ""In that sense, what these women have done was heroic."" Indeed, many here argue that true Saudi society, which foreign visitors and journalists are not able to mix with, is still by and large a closed, introverted and largely xenophobic group of people. A Saudi official said the primary reason why the country has never had a reliable census, for example, is ""that people here don't let a stranger into their home to ask questions about how many children you have or how many relatives live with you."" Against this deeply conservative social fabric, the action of the women on Tuesday stands out like sudden turbulence in the quiet flow of glacial Saudi social development. Keeping Everything in Balance ""Over here, there is a genuine aversion to the word revolution,"" said a member of the Saudi royal family. ""Balance and tradition are the key elements of ruling Saudi Arabia, never one without the other."" To navigate the course, the house of Saud has always coupled its bent for modernization with an umbrella of religious legitimacy kept firmly over its head. It is also mindful that it has to remain the single unifying factor in a country of diverse tribes, family clans, religious interests and, indeed, vastly different cultures. In that sense, the liberal minority, which is growing in ranks as more and more Saudis return home with a foreign education, is only the latest interest group to stake its claim for the attention of the Saud family. ""We rule, as we have always ruled, in our capacity as reformers allied with a mainstream religious establishment,"" the prince said. ""The legitimacy of our Government is based on a reformist Islamic movement that began 300 years ago and is still going strong. Why change something you know to have worked for you for so long for something you don't know? Government and religion here are two sides of the same coin."" Thus, in August when King Fahd decided to call in American troops to protect the country from Iraq, he sought out the country's most respected religious authority, Sheik Abdel Aziz ibn Baaz. The cleric issued a ruling that even though the Americans are, in the conservative religious view, equivalent to nonbelievers as they are not Muslims, they deserve support because they are here to defend Islam. Pressure When Necessary Clearly this sort of thing has taken some arm-twisting, which the ruling family is not above doing when necessary. ""To push the religious establishment around when it comes to the threat of an Iraqi assault against Saudi Arabia is a vital interest for this country, so the King would go to battle for that,"" said a Saudi official, who, like all Saudis discussing such sensitive matters, asked not to be further identified. ""But to push them around so that some women can drive is not a vital interest."" It is precisely because of their acute awareness of these realities, that the women who began their startling rebellion on Tuesday by breaking the sanctions against driving, said they were doing it in the name of the purest Islamic values. They repeatedly asserted that it had nothing to do with the Americans being here, although they were clearly taking advantage of the opening that their presence has brought in Saudi discourse. Their assertion was that a good Muslim woman should not be left alone in the company of a man who is not her relative, such as the expatriate drivers they have to use. They also said that the circumstances facing the country demanded more active participation of its women in case of war, when they might have to drive cars in emergencies. They never said they were striving for democratic rights. Democracy Isn't the Rallying Cry ""You cannot say you are doing this in the name of democracy,"" the political science professor said. ""If we really had a democratic vote on driving here, I'll bet you not 70 but 700 women will come out to say they are against driving because religious authorities have not sanctioned it and because it threatens the protective cocoon that envelops their lives."" Similarly, the liberal establishment, which consists of urban, educated, widely traveled folks, is arguing that it is acting for the greater good of Saudi society -- a society they say has leaped into the 21st century thanks to its oil money, but without the tools to use advanced technology because of interpretations of Islamic values. For the Saud family, there is a genuine shared interest with the religious establishment against any significant expansion of democratic participation in decision-making. But there are also among the 5,000 to 7,000 princes of the family some liberals, highly educated individuals who feel that the country must bridge the gap between its technological progress and its social values.",1990,"Saudi Arabia"

Morocco, just south of Europe across the Strait of Gibraltar, is the most Western of all Arab countries, both geographically and culturally. Saudi Arabia is not on the continent of Africa but to its east, beyond the Red Sea. The women of Saudi Arabia, a fundamentalist, repressive country, and those of Morocco live far apart, in different worlds. I lived in the Middle East a lot longer than six months - 12 years, on and off. Sure, some Muslim women get driver's licenses and are educated, but by and large they still rank somewhere below the family donkey. Their role is to serve males and have lots of children and work in the fields and orange groves. Some Muslim women, like a lot of Manhattan women I know, are cheerful; they like their families and lives. But their roles are defined and limited.

"140","MIDEAST TENSIONS; Saudi Women Take Driver's Seat in a Rare Protest for the Right to Travel","MENA","In daring defiance of the Saudi tradition against women driving, about 70 veiled Saudi women gathered on Tuesday in front of a supermarket in Riyadh, dismissed their drivers and drove in a convoy of cars before being stopped and and detained by the police a short time later. Saudis said the demonstration for the right to drive was the first known open protest by Saudi women and an exceedingly rare manifestation of public sentiment in this conservative Islamic nation. Equally startling was that virtually all of the women received the support of their husbands or close male relatives before undertaking the action, several organizers said. Plush Sedans The cars -- about 40 dark, plush Lincoln Continentals, Mercedes-Benzes, Buicks and Japanese luxury sedans -- were intercepted by the Saudi police at intersections after the convoy had broken into smaller groups, about a half-hour after the protest began. Some of the women in the cars refused to lower their windows or communicate with the police before they were taken away. Saudi officials said early this morning that the women had been released after signing a pledge that they would not repeat their action elsewhere. The demonstration came at a time when the presence of American and other Western forces is stirring considerable debate here about whether to bring this country more in tune with the modern world. But many of the women involved in the demonstration were eager to emphasize that it had nothing to do with the large presence of Westerners here since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The protest was not publicized in advance to Western news organizations. Barred by Tradition Although some Saudi women have pressed for a wider array of rights, organizers said the protest was focused narrowly on the right to drive as a matter of convenience and household economics. Although there is no written law that prevents women from driving here, they are barred by tradition from doing so and must use a paid driver or a relative to go anywhere. Under severe Islamic strictures, Saudi women are veiled and robed from head to toe, forbidden from appearing in public with men and from traveling anywhere without permission from husbands or male relatives. Organizers of the demonstration said many of the women had gotten driver's licenses while in the United States or Europe. They said that many were highly educated and came from prominent families, a factor that may have figured in their treatment by the authorities. It was doubtful, however, that the Saudi authorities would react more harshly because the status of women here, while inferior to men, is also highly protected by tradition and paternalism. No Official Mention The protest became the talk of this the country Tuesday evening, evidently through word of mouth. In phone interviews from places around the country, Saudis used words like ""amazing"" and ""astounding"" to describe the incident. There was no mention of it on any Saudi news reports, however, and many Saudis were certain that the Saudi authorities would suppress any information about it. The organizers said they sent dozens of telegrams to senior Saudi officials explaining that their intention was for the greater good of Saudi Arabia. The incident began late Tuesday afternoon with women, some accompanied by daughters, converging on the Al Tamimi Safeway supermarket parking lot, driven there by their chauffeurs. There, the drivers were left behind as some of the women got into the driver's seats and the rest occupied passenger seats. At least one woman's husband followed in another car from a distance -- for ""moral support,"" he said. 'Couldn't Believe My Ears' ""I couldn't believe my ears when madame asked me for the car keys and told me to get out and then drove away with the others,"" said a Sri Lankan driver who identified himself as T. R. Zein. Another chauffeur, an Indonesian who said his name was Asmara, said his employer brought her 15-year-old daughter along and left the house while her husband was present and presumably informed about her intentions. ""I think he knows,"" the Indonesian man said of the husband. Mr. Zein, who sat on the sidewalk next with about 25 other, mostly Asian drivers, said he drove his employer, whom he described as a 35-year-old schoolteacher, along with her teen-age daughter. ""There were about 40 cars here and they left us all here,"" he said as other drivers nodded. ""They drove together. I think the police caught them later."" 'We Wanted to Be Heard' The Saudi religious police known as the Committee for Commendation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice rounded up all of the cars and the women at intersections. They prevented curious onlookers from approaching an area where they were stopped on King Abdel Aziz Road. The police could be seen asking women to get out from driver's seats and to sit in back seats, as more police cars converged on one site where the women's cars were stopped. The women were deliberately trying to draw attention and fully expected to be arrested, one of the organizers said. ""We wanted to be heard by the authorities, loudly and clearly,"" she said in a telephone interview a few hours later. Later, in separate telephone interviews, two of the women who helped organize the demonstration and who insisted on not being identified explained that they spent a week planning the event. They all agreed that a leading figure behind the protest was Aisha al-Maneh, a sociology professor who received her doctorate from the University of Colorado in Boulder. They described her as an outspoken advocate among hundreds of other educated women in Saudi Arabia who have argued that there were no edicts in Islam that ban women from driving. 'Patriotic' Protest Mrs. Aisha, who taught for some time at the university here before she reportedly quit in frustration over other restrictions imposed on women, could not be reached for comment. The two women who participated in the organization of the demonstration said they meant no harm to Saudi Arabia and strongly defended their action as ""patriotic"" and ""necessary."" ""It is important for the authorities to understand that as educated women who have driven themselves abroad while we pursued graduate studies, we cannot be reduced to being dependent on strangers to drive us,"" said a 36-year-old woman who asked not to be identified by name. ""In addition to being humiliating, this is anti-Islamic,"" she said. ""Islam says that a woman should not be left alone in the company of a man who is not her relative and that is exactly what happens everytime I am driven in my car by a Pakistani, Sudanese or other person who is a driver. Besides, this is very expensive on our family budget."" Such complaints have been heard many times here and are openly discussed on Saudi television programs, but they have failed so far to bring about change. 'Supporting Islam' ""We wanted to send the message with this drastic action we were forced to undertake that we are not breaking the rules of Islam, but supporting Islam,"" one protester said. ""All those who participated today were veiled and accompanied by other women. They drove slowly and well. They did not break any laws."" The participants said they would repeat their actions again. Several senior Saudi officials interviewed Tuesday night said they supported the women's goals, although they took exception with the protest itself. ""We have been debating this issue for quite some time and some of the most senior people in the country are in favor of allowing women to drive for perfectly handsome reasons,"" said a senior official who asked not to be identified. ""But in our country everything happens through evolution, not revolution."" It was significant that the demonstration took place in Riyadh, which is the heart of the conservative religious establishment. Najd, the region in which Riyadh lies, is largely populated by the descendants of the inner tribal desert Bedouins. Geographically isolated, it has been the region most resistant to the gradual modernization urged by the Saudi Government and the royal family. By contrast, Jidda, a Red Sea port that lies in the region known as Hijaz, has been the most liberal city because of its exposure to travelers and foreigners. Saudi women can be seen there walking without their faces veiled and frequenting public restaurants in the company of their husbands, something that rarely occurs here.",1990,"Saudi Arabia"
"141","MIDEAST TENSIONS; Ban on Driving by Women Reaffirmed by Saudis","MENA","On the advice of its conservative religious leadership, the Saudi Government has declared firmly that it remained impermissible for women to drive cars in this Arab kingdom. In its first formal reaction to the furor caused by the decision of some 5 women, many from prominent families, to break the traditional Saudi taboos and drive their own cars on Nov. 6, the Ministry of the Interior said on television Tuesday night and in today's press that ""Women are strictly not allowed to drive cars in the kingdom and anyone violating this prohibition is liable to deterrent punishment."" It was not specific what that punishment might be. The ministry said the ban, which only formalizes what had been the tradition here, was based on a ""fatwa"" or religious edict issued on Nov. 5 by the head of the administration of religious scholarship and rulings, Sheik Abdul al-Aziz bin Abdallah bin Baz. Although the ruling appears only directed to driving by women, several Saudi officials and foreign diplomats said the move may foretell far-greater political significance. Severe Reaction to Protest They said it is a strong signal that social liberalization and openness to what are seen here as radical Western ideas will continue to be strictly limited in this extremely conservative Muslim monarchy at a time when it is dependent on foreign governments and armies to defend itself. The decree does not seem to affect American servicewomen who have been allowed to drive vehicles in connection with military duties. Until today, custom rather than decree prohibited women from driving. But in an increasingly severe reaction over the last week, at least five and perhaps as many as nine of the women protesters reportedly have been fired from teaching jobs they held at women's universities here. Other women who took part in the protest have been accused of working for foreign governments and warned to keep a low profile or risk punishment,according to officials informed on the matter. The issue is so sensitive that no official or private citizen would be quoted by name. Act of Political Defiance ""They are in deep trouble,"" said a friend of some of the women protesters. ""There may be further sanctions against them."" It is difficult for an outsider to appreciate the impact here of a small group of women deciding to drive their cars in an act of public protest. But in a land where there is no tradition of freedom of speech, the protest amounted to an act of political defiance at a time when there is considerable talk in elite circles here on the desirability of change e following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. In its statement published today, the Ministry of the Interior said: ""Driving by women contradicts the Islamic traditions followed by Saudi citizens."" The ministry added that Muslim scholars had determined that driving ""degrades and harms the sanctity"" of women. Royal Family Struggle As the top Muslim leader in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Baz is known for strong conservative views.. Muslim religious leaders have a major influence on political and social issues in a kingdom where Islam governs all aspects of daily life and the monarchy tries to balance demands for change with defense of the status quo. The reaction against the women's protest is part of a widespread debate over the pace of social change that is being pressed here by an elite of Westernized urban professionals. The attention given to the driving incident may also reflect a quiet struggle within the ruling Saudi royal family, where those who want to modernize more quickly are sparring with more traditional leaders. according to Saudi officials. The traditionalists have used the women's driving incident to argue that the modernizers are moving too fast and are threatening Saudi culture and the monarchy, according to two Government officials. An Affront to the King One of the officials, who has ties to the royal family, said King Fahd had been upset that the protesters had chosen in effect to try to change the system by openly challenging traditions by a public protest, which began when the women assembled at a local Safeway store, told their drivers to step out of the cars, and then drove off in a convoy before being stopped by the police. An official said that was considered an affront to the King and a dangerous precedent that could serve as an example for other dissident groups. ""The King is at fault for moving too slowly on this issue,"" the Government official said. ""He should have opened up driving for women in the special circumstances of the crisis with Iraq, perhaps by allowing them to drive ambulances or allowing foreign women to drive first."" ""But the women made a mistake to have a public protest,"" the official said. ""Now they have made this into a power struggle with the conservatives. They have probably set back driving by women for five more years, maybe a decade."" Saudi Press Reports Prohibited Two Government officials said that conservatives within the royal family and Government also have used the controversy to argue that foreign reporters share the blame because they publicized the women's protest that otherwise might have gone unreported. Saudi newspapers were prohibited by the monarchy from reporting the protest when it happened, according to several Saudis informed on the issue. The Government official said conservatives are arguing that the women held their protest hoping the foreign press would report it and that such reporting amounted to meddling in internal Saudi affairs. In Saudi Arabia, women are prohibited not only from driving, but also from working with men. Single women also cannot travel or go out alone without a chaperone. Conservative Majority Victory A friend of two of the Saudi women who took part in the protest said they had done it out of frustration, hoping to prod the monarchy into finally permitting women to drive -- a right permitted in all other Arab countries. The would-be liberalizers congratulated themselves, thinking they had perhaps won the first round by sending a convoy of affluent women into the streets behind the wheels of their Mercedeses and Cadillacs. They had learned to drive when living abroad. But it now appears that the overwhelmingly conservative majority that dominates this country has won the second and for now the final round. ""I want to drive,"" said a Saudi woman professional who added that she had been considering organizing a protest of her own in another city. ""But the truth is that most Saudis don't agree with me.""",1990,"Saudi Arabia"
"142","Women In Gaza See Gains","MENA","Sitting on the beach in pants and sunglasses, her hair uncovered, the Muslim woman broke into a smile as she described how the simple act of choosing for herself what to wear had given her a new sense of freedom. Since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in May and the arrival of the Palestinian police, the woman, Zahira Abu Kweik, has taken off the head scarf once imposed on local women by Islamic fundamentalists. ""They used to come and tell me, 'You're a Muslim, cover your hair,' but now nobody says anything,"" Mrs. Abu Kweik said. ""There's a feeling of security."" Part of an austere social code enforced during the uprising against Israeli occupation, the head scarf is now being left at home by some women in Gaza. For sure, they are still a small minority in this religiously conservative city, but their numbers on the streets are growing, part of a general easing of tensions since Israeli forces left in May. Still, while the mood may be more relaxed and women are enjoying greater leeway in what they wear, many Gazans question whether this augurs genuine gains in rights and social status. With the formal establishment this month of a Palestinian self-governing authority in Gaza and the town of Jericho on the West Bank, women's groups have begun pressing the case for equality more insistently.  Meet With Arafat Women from the various political groups have joined forces to press their issues before the nascent Palestinian authority, taking their case to Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. At a meeting with him in Gaza this month, they won a commitment to form a council on women's affairs, answerable to Mr. Arafat himself. They have also circulated a proposed bill of rights for women, which they want included in a planned Palestinian constitution. The head scarf, and the readiness of some women to discard it, is perhaps the most visible symbol of the changes afoot. During the uprising, it was promoted as a symbol of religious defiance of the Israeli authorities, a sign of mourning for Palestinians killed in street clashes and protection against any harassment by Israeli soldiers. Now, with the Israelis gone from towns and refugee areas and with Palestinian police officers on the streets, women who have taken off the scarf say they no longer fear attacks by Islamic militants, who sometimes used to throw stones, eggs and even paint at those they considered immodestly dressed. The relatively relaxed atmosphere is evident in clothing shops, which now display brightly colored dresses, some well above ankle length, as an alternative to the somber Islamic gowns that used to predominate. Beauty parlors are back in business. For years, many were closed and some set on fire by militant Islamic groups, which called them dens of promiscuity, where women were blackmailed into becoming informers for the Israeli security service. Hair styling, makeup and evening dresses, considered frivolities during the uprising, are again acceptable. Pluses and Minuses But are these changes enough? Leaders of women's groups here are not so sure as they tote up their gains and losses from the period resistance against Israel. At first, they say, the revolt helped women by bringing them out of the houses and into the streets to join the protests. It put them in charge of families and political groups when men were arrested or killed, and gave them a new political awareness. But rigid social attitudes were imposed as the revolt wore on, and these tended to hurt women, the leaders say. This went beyond strict dress codes. Women were pressed to stay at home to avoid accusations of promiscuity and collaboration with Israel at workplaces. Scores of women accused of being informers and prostitutes were killed, and young teen-age girls were married off by their parents to prevent suspicion. Maryam Zaqout, a feminist leader from Khan Yunis in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, said that women's groups did not promote their own issues during the uprising, and as a result they neglected problems like domestic violence and drastic underpayment of women who did work. ""We concentrated on the political struggle and not on women's issues because we felt that our energies should be focused on the main problem, the occupation, not social problems,"" Mrs. Zaqout said. ""That was a mistake. We've realized that social and political freedom are one -- they go together.""",1994,"Palestine"

The women did oppose violence, but what primarily motivated them to organize was the use of excessive force by Israeli troops against young Palestinian protesters. Weekly vigils by Women in Black were aimed at ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Participants held signs saying only ""End the Occupation"" or ""Talk to the P.L.O."" In October 1989, 300 Israeli and Palestinian members of Women in Black sent a telegram to the Israeli Government protesting the tearing apart of families in forced deportations from the West Bank of women who lacked residence permits. The movement spread to the United States in April 1988, when the Brooklyn-based Jewish Women's Committee to End the Occupation began weekly Women in Black vigils. Similar groups formed in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, California, Washington and Oregon. Rachel Ostrowitz, an Israeli member, expressed the spirit of the vigils when she wrote: ""We will not allow our senses to be numbed by the daily killings. We will not accept oppression, discrimination or exploitation as part of our political system. We won't give up or shut up, or put up with the current version of reality.""

"144","Mutilation of Egyptian Girls: Despite Ban, It Goes On","MENA","In the weeks since the Egyptian Health Minister banned the ritual genital mutilation of girls, no one in this Nile Delta farming town has consulted the senior local cleric on whether to proceed with the custom. People plan to do it anyway. The cleric, Sheik Taha Gad, expects most Egyptians to defy the ministerial decree. The importance that families put on trying to curb a woman's sexual appetite is so deeply ingrained that everyone from the local farmers appalled by the ruling to the top Government official responsible for putting it into effect says that some social customs are too potent to be extinguished by law. ""Islam says circumcision for men is a tradition of the Prophet,"" the Sheik said. ""Men are obligated to do it to emulate him, and for women it is a virtue. But it is not really an issue that is discussed in public. Remember that Egyptian society clings tightly to its traditions and principles, so there is no change under way, and if one ever materializes no one will talk about it."" The expected defiance underscores the difficulty that any government -- even an autocratic one extremely sensitive to its international image -- faces in trying to alter social practices widely denounced abroad when they are embedded at home. The tradition seems to be more of an African puberty rite than an Islamic one. It is frequently practiced in Egypt and the Sudan as well as sub-Saharan Africa, among Christians as well as Muslims, but is virtually unknown in most Arab countries. Despite the general taboo against discussing the custom, the debate has been heard periodically in public for almost two years now, pressed by new women's groups and human rights organizations. They point to the trauma involved for young girls and try to debunk the idea that a woman's sexual temptations, and by extension her family's honor, can be safeguarded only through a clitoridectomy, or removal of the clitoris and sometimes of surrounding labial tissue. The procedure eliminates or severely reduces a woman's genital sexual sensation. Clitoridectomy is less drastic than infibulation, which involves removing all of a woman's external genitalia and sewing the wound shut until she is married, leaving a small hole for urination. These procedures are often referred to as female circumcision. The recent ban in Egypt stemmed from a combination of factors. The new Health Minister, Ismail Sallem, and the new head of Al Azhar, the country's leading Islamic institution, both refused to endorse the custom. In addition, there has been prominent coverage this summer of a few little girls who reportedly bled to death -- including a Cairo girl passing through this town. In Egypt the procedure is performed by midwives or barbers under the supervision of the adult women in the family, usually without anesthesia and often under less than hygienic conditions. ""The big problem, what makes us really apprehensive, is that most of this is done behind closed doors at home,"" said Dr. Mushira al-Shafie, the Deputy Health Minister. Many have compared the current campaign to the battle to introduce birth control here. Birth control was widely assailed as a sin when a drive to educate the public and provide contraceptives began in 1980. That campaign took about four years to have an effect. ""When we started the birth control campaign, everyone was against us,"" Dr. Shafie said, recalling the outcry over a poster that included a drawing of a woman's uterus. ""People were asking us why we wanted to limit the number of children when God takes care of everybody."" A coming health education and public relations campaign on clitoridectomy will emphasize that the practice can scar children psychologically and lead to future problems in sexual relations, menstruation and labor. The moral and religious message, Dr. Shafie said, must be left up to Al Azhar's scholars. At this point, the religious scholars are not all convinced. The last leader of Al Azhar had issued a religious decree proclaiming that Islam endorsed the practice of clitoridectomy. In response to the decree by that leader, Sheik Gad al-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq, who died in March, the Health Ministry declared last year that clitoridectomies must be performed only in hospitals, to make the procedure safer for the girls, who are usually between the ages of 4 and 10. Opponents of the procedure were shocked, feeling that the decision to confine the procedure to hospitals gave the practice a Government seal of approval. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights brought suit against Al Azhar to have the religious fiat reversed. While the suit has been meandering through the courts, the new head of Al Azhar, Sheik Mohammed Tantawi, expressed reservations about the practice. He said the Koran did not mention the topic and references in the sayings of the Prophet Mohammed, the source of much Islamic law, were too vague to constitute a ruling. The decision should be left up to the medical establishment, he said. The Health Ministry stepped in with its ban, superseding its 1995 action. An estimated 100 million women today have undergone some form of traditional genital mutilation, and each year about 2 million more girls undergo the procedure. Although more than 20 countries in Africa have published policies opposing the procedures, they are rarely prohibited by law. Nawal Saadawy, the Egyptian feminist whose book ""The Hidden Face of Eve"" described her own experience with genital mutilation, estimates that in the United States, where she now teaches, about 40,000 of the procedures are performed each year in immigrant communities. Several states have laws against the practice, and the Federal Government has pursued the issue as well. Britain and France have made the procedures illegal. No one is quite sure how the tradition got started. Marie Assaad, the coordinator of the National Female Genital Mutilation Task Force in Egypt, wrote in a groundbreaking study that the tradition might have come from the Pharaohs. They apparently believed that gods were bisexual but that humans needed to have those tendencies excised through circumcision for men and clitoridectomy for women. To this day, villagers around places like Minya el Qamh, 30 miles northeast of Cairo, believe that a woman will pursue sex as aggressively as a man if she has not undergone a clitoridectomy. ""Am I supposed to stand around while my daughter chases men?"" said Said Ibrahim, 53, a farmer aghast over the Government ban. ""So what if some infidel doctor says it is unhealthy? Does that make it true? I would have circumcised my daughter even if they passed a death sentence against it."" Mr. Ibrahim said villagers would not obey the ruling unless they were persuaded to by a religious leader. ""You know what honor is in Egypt,"" he said. ""If a woman is more passive it is in her interest, it is in her father's interest and in her husband's interest."" The conviction crosses generational lines. Mohammed Ali, 17, said he would not associate with a woman who had not undergone the procedure. ""Banning it would make women wild like those in America,"" he said. Dr. Shafie, the Deputy Health Minister, says women feel that their reputations are at stake and therefore do not object to the practice. Estimates on the number of girls who have undergone the procedure in Egypt range from 80 to 97 percent. It is believed to be ubiquitous in smaller villages, but the highest numbers are discounted because women might profess to having undergone the ritual, since it is considered such a hallmark of female modesty. Belief in the practice is not limited to rural areas. Dr. Said M. Thabit, a Cairo obstetrician, said he had not heard about the Government ban but believed that it would be catastrophic on moral and hygienic grounds. ""With circumcision we remove the external parts, so when a girl wears tight nylon underclothes she will not have any stimulation,"" said Dr. Thabit, who thinks the operation should be performed only by doctors and who keeps a collection of pictures of procedures botched by village barbers. Dr. Gamal Gaith, who works at the Minya el Qamh Public Hospital, said the decree finally prompted him to turn families away. ""I used to do it,"" he said, ""even though I knew it was harmful for the women, because of the money."" Map of Egypt showing location of Minya el Qamh.",1996,"Egypt"
"145","U.S. Should Protest Afghan Women's Plight","MENA","To the Editor: As you report (news articles, Sept. 28, Oct. 2 and Oct. 4), the Muslim clerics who now rule Afghanistan have closed girls' schools, banned women from working outside of their homes and ordered all women to cover themselves completely when in public. Yet another nation-state is now enforcing what it contends are ""Muslim principles"" on its female population, thereby rendering them dependent and defenseless. The double standard so often invoked where the treatment of women is concerned is already apparent. Your Oct. 4 article queries whether Amnesty International's description of this as a ""reign of terror"" might not be ""an exaggeration."" Would any other situation in which half a country's population is terrified of being beaten by the other half if it goes to work or shows its ankles in public be seen as anything other than a reign of terror? The old ""cultural defense"" of such tyranny against women was rejected at the Fourth World Conference on Women just a year ago in Beijing, where the platform for action asserted: ""While the significance of national and religious particularities and various historical, cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind, it is the duty of states, regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms."" This is the first time since the Beijing conference that a regime has suddenly adapted new violations of women's basic rights. Our Government should exert its influence, with like-minded governments and the United Nations, to insure that the Beijing proclamations do not so soon become a paper tiger.

"147","Sudan's Capital Bans Mixing of Sexes in Public","MENA","The city of Khartoum has ordered the separation of the sexes in public to conform with strict Muslim law. This separation requires barriers between men and women at social events and bans them from sitting facing each other. A ""public order law"" announced Tuesday dictates that the barriers be used at weddings, parties and picnics and prohibits certain other practices perceived as inappropriate in an Islamic society. It also requires buses to display a verse from the Koran, Islam's holy book, asking Muslims to avoid looking at members of the opposite sex. The law specifies that streets must be well lighted to prevent couples from vanishing into the darkness for unauthorized activities. The law, issued by the Khartoum Council, did not say what the punishments would be, but the tone was reminiscent of Iran's enforcement of its version of Islamic law after the 1979 revolution. The council urged a media campaign to explain the law to the public, the state Sudan News Agency reported. The law was apparently inspired by President Omar el-Bashir's Muslim fundamentalist Government. Islamic law, known as Sharia, was adopted in the Sudan in 1983, but it was given a new thrust when Mr. Bashir took power in a coup in 1989. But an earlier attempt to enforce the Government's interpretation of appropriate Islamic dress for women -- wearing the veil to cover the hair -- was rejected by Sudanese women, who did not want to give up their colorful ""tobes,"" flowing gowns like Indian saris. The new law does not enforce wearing the veil, but it ordered women working in restaurants not to wear jewelry or perfume. Women who do late-night shopping must be accompanied by a male relative. And on buses, women will not be permitted to sit near the driver. Women's sporting events will also be restricted. Under the new law, they must be held in private, and the athletes will not be permitted to wear tight-fitting clothes. Women performing Sudanese folk dances must wear long, loose-fitting costumes. Men were ordered to cover their bodies well, apparently to reduce temptation, and were told not to lurk outside girls' schools. Male students will also be separated from females in private schools, as they already are in public schools. In addition, card playing will be prohibited in public in line with Islamic strictures on gambling. President Bashir's Government has exempted the Sudan's southern Christians from Islamic laws, and consideration is being given to extending the exemption to Christians in the north, even though Muslims are in the majority there. The adoption of the strict law by the city government in the capital raised the prospect that other Muslim-majority cities will adopt similar laws. But it was not clear whether such a move was planned.",1996,"Sudan"
"148","Editorial Notebook; The Courageous Women of Iran","MENA","Each morning as the sun slides above the horizon, a small group of daring women gather on a hilltop in Mellat Park, a tidy green oasis in northern Teheran. They come to exercise a newly won right, doing calisthenics in a public spot. As the women beat their arms and their dark coats billow in the morning chill, they look like a flock of ravens about to take flight. It is another small victory for the women of Iran. Until recently women were barred from working out in public, in deference to the Islamic requirements of modesty. Even when jogging, stretching or engaging in other athletic activity, they must keep their heads covered and wear a loose-fitting coat or cloak. Though Iran is by no means the most constrictive society for women in the Muslim world, the limitations seem especially oppressive because they were imposed less than two decades ago and are enforced as much to discourage individuality as to maintain religious faith. They are part of a system of ideological and political control used by the ruling clerics to keep order and limit liberty. But if the clerics think they can subdue Iranian women, they are mistaken. At every age and economic level, women resent the restraints and are struggling to overcome them. The clearest sign was the overwhelming majority of women who voted in May for Mohammed Khatami, a presidential candidate who seems to favor more equality for women. Propelled by the support of women and young people, he easily defeated the candidate favored by the conservative clerics. Mr. Khatami, a cleric himself, may not soon deliver the changes women want, in part because reform is opposed by the religious leaders who still control the military and security services and dictate the laws of Iran. But even without much help from Mr. Khatami, women clearly intend to press for change in everything from the dress code to the divorce and inheritance laws that discriminate severely against them. The dress restrictions are dehumanizing, submerging the individual identity of women in a colorless sea. Not a single woman in Teheran, a dusty metropolis of 12 million people, dares wear anything other than a dark, bulky raincoat or black chador, the traditional Islamic cloak, and no woman leaves home without a scarf or other head covering, even on scorching summer days. But many women I met, while resentful of the dress standards, are troubled more by inequities in the law. Men can divorce their wives without cause at any time and are automatically awarded custody of children. Wives who outlive their husbands are generally permitted a much smaller inheritance than men who outlive their wives, regardless of variations in income. A woman who kills a child is subject to capital punishment; a man who commits the same crime is not. ""These are violations of our human rights,"" Shirin Ebadi, a former judge, told me. Ms. Ebadi lost that job after the Iranian revolution in 1979, when the victorious clerics ruled that women could not be judges, a ban that was ended only this week. She has worked quietly but persistently since then to expand women's rights. By avoiding overt political activity, and limiting her comments to legal matters, Ms. Ebadi has found a form of dissent the authorities seem willing to tolerate, though she has no guarantee that will last. ""I am walking on an edge,"" she said. Though women from affluent, educated families lived more freely before the clerics took power, there is little nostalgia here for Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi. His was a corrupt, oppressive regime that limited opportunities for women in other ways. The enrollment of women in universities is much higher now than it was under the Shah, and many go on to work as teachers, accountants, bankers, doctors and members of Parliament. But even for them, there is no escaping the unequal laws and stifling customs of Islamic fundamentalism. The ruling clerics would be wise to let Mr. Khatami relax the restrictions. The women who gather each morning in Mellat Park, and millions like them across Iran, are a powerful political force impatient for change.   PHILIP TAUBMAN",1997,"Iran"
"149","Freedom From Mutilation","MENA","Egyptian women won a heartening victory for human rights and personal freedom this week when Egypt's highest court found that the ritual cutting off of the clitoris and other parts of young women's genitalia was not an Islamic religious practice authorized by the Koran. The ruling removed the last legal barrier to enforcing the Egyptian Health Ministry's 1996 prohibition of this excruciating and life-threatening procedure, which has been inflicted on tens of thousands of Egyptian women every year, Coptic Christian and Muslim alike. The Health Ministry must now see to it that the prohibition is vigorously and consistently enforced, in poor and rural areas as well as among the more worldly upper classes. The ruling, with which Egypt's most prestigious Islamic scholar concurs, will also encourage anti-mutilation campaigners throughout Africa, where two million women undergo the procedure each year and nearly 100 million live with its disastrous physical and emotional consequences. Typically, mutilation is inflicted on teen-age or younger girls, using no anesthesia and employing unsterilized knives, razors or pieces of glass. The intended purpose is to deny women the possibility of sexual pleasure, and hence discourage sexual freedom. The unintended consequences often include infection, hemorrhaging, infertility and death. Hundreds of thousands of African immigrants to America come from areas where female genital mutilation is common, and some have sought to perform the procedure here. Several states, and last year the Federal Government, have banned mutilation, and women fleeing their homelands to escape the practice now have a legally recognized basis for refugee status in this country. But the main struggle against mutilation is being waged in Africa by African women, with help from the World Health Organization, Unicef and the United Nations Population Fund. In many countries these campaigners have been thwarted by critics who invoke supposed Islamic teachings and by others who charge that they are lending themselves to Western attacks on local traditions. But this is more than a local struggle. It is an international movement against ignorance and cruelty, which can only be energized by this week's ruling.",1997,"Egypt"

"151","A Manual On Rights Of Women Under Islam","MENA","For several years, an informal group of Muslim women from around the world has met to spur discussion among Muslims everywhere about the rights of women. Now, with the shadow of a repressive Islamic regime in Afghanistan hovering over the debate, the group has produced a manual on the rights of women under Islam. Intended to be adaptable to a wide range of cultures, the new publication, ""Claiming Our Rights: A Manual for Women's Human Rights Education in Muslim Societies,"" will be tested over the next year in five very different countries: Bangladesh, Jordan, Lebanon, Malaysia and Uzbekistan. The plan is to assemble discussion groups to exchange ideas on the subject. There has already been a quiet trial run among a group of university women in Iran. ""There is a great change in self-awareness among women in Muslim societies,"" said Mahnaz Afkhami, executive director of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a private organization based in Bethesda, Md. Ms. Af khami directed the effort on the manual, produced with the help of the National Endowment for Democracy and the Ford Foundation. Sometimes at great risk to themselves, women are making gains, though frequently small and fragile.  But developments like the introduction of more egalitarian family laws in North Africa often go unnoticed, Ms. Afkhami said, because militants and fundamentalists dominate contemporary images of Islam. ""This very sound-bite-friendly Islamicist movement doesn't allow the other side to be heard,"" she said in an interview. ""But women are often the center of debate, even in Iran."" Ms. Afkhami, who was Minister for Women's Affairs in the Government of the last Shah of Iran, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, has strong critics among Islamic women because of that. And she is aware that promoting women's rights from a base outside the Muslim world attracts the criticism that the campaign is Western and alien. ""We are not confrontational,"" she said. ""Our manual is Islam-based and not threatening. Our hope is that we can get people to engage in dialogue."" The manual on women's rights in Islam -- which is being published in Arabic, Bengali, Malay, Persian and Uzbek as well as English -- contains instructions for conducting grass-roots discussions. It also includes sometimes provocative passages from the Koran -- like those about a husband's punishment of an ""ill-behaved"" wife -- and the Hadith, the often-disputed collection of teachings of Mohammed as recorded by religious leaders centuries later. Juxtaposed are texts of major international agreements on human rights, particularly women's rights, which many Muslim nations have signed. The book briefly profiles four women it calls ""the first heroines of Islam"": two wives of Mohammed; his daughter Fatima, and Zainab, the sister of a Shiite leader who persuaded a victorious enemy to spare her brother's life. There is also a sampling of Arab proverbs about women, a bibliography, and the names, addresses and telephone and fax numbers of women's rights groups throughout the Islamic world. Women who contributed to the manual brought a range of experiences to bear, Ms. Afkhami said. In Bangladesh, there is an interest in more sophisticated political training at the local level. In Uzbekistan, women are concerned that they will lose rights they enjoyed under Communism. In Malaysia, women's organizations are engaged in scholarly revision of traditional Muslim laws. ""Give women rights, let them participate -- that's the lesson of Malaysia,"" Ms. Afkhami said. ""The spirit of our religion is egalitarian.""",1996,"Iran"

"153","Women Being Forced From U.N. Workplaces in Afghanistan","MENA","Women are being forced out of United Nations workplaces in Afghanistan because self-appointed conservative Islamic councils are threatening to attack the women and the offices. In Jalalabad, where United Nations agencies are caring for more than 100,000 Afghans recovering from civil war, at least three United Nations offices have kept women home rather than risk the collapse of their programs, officials said. An orthodox Islamic movement known as the Taliban is said to be behind the effort to keep women -- from office cleaners to engineers, teachers and health workers -- in their homes. The enforcers are local groups called shuras, which are mobilizing mobs to assault women on their way to work at international agencies or volunteer organizations and sack the offices that employ them, officials say. Peter Hansen, head of the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, said some Afghan women were continuing to work at home or were on paid leave until their contracts expired. But he acknowledged that they risked losing their jobs permanently if a compromise could not be reached. He said the confrontation posed a ""terrible dilemma"" for United Nations agencies including the High Commissioner for Refugees and Unicef, as well as other agencies working in the country. Private organizations working in Afghanistan and human rights groups are outraged by what they see as the willingness of the United Nations to abandon women for the sake of smooth relations with religious conservatives. ""It doesn't shock us so much what the Afghans do,"" said Surita Sandosham, executive director of Equality Now, a New York-based group that helps women organize rights campaigns around the world. ""What is shocking is that U.N. bodies are acquiescing."" Equality Now has lobbied to take the case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. In a letter to the committee, Pamela Collett of the Pakistan-Afghanistan field office of Save the Children, said, ""The question is, should U.N. agencies continue programming which benefits only males and/or employs only males in accordance with the shuras' decrees?"" Mr. Hansen, who recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan, said he had met with militants now in control of the southern city of Kandahar to discuss reports that they had closed all schools to girls. He said he had told them that women's rights were human rights and that unless they accepted international norms, they would lose international support. He said they had assured him that girls would get an education in keeping with what religious practice allows. Ms. Collett said in her letter to the Human Rights Committee that the Taliban's pledges were suspect. ""As it is the Taliban's particular interpretation of Islam which they have used to justify restricting women to the home,"" she wrote, ""this assurance that Hansen received does not guarantee that women's and girls' rights will be acknowledged."" The Taliban have captured several cities in Afghanistan and are now poised to attack Kabul, the capital.  But things in Government-held areas are not much better, women's groups say. In September the Afghan delegation to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing was prohibited from attending at the last minute because the Government decided that the gathering would promote ""immoral and un-Islamic behavior.""",1995,"Afghanistan"
"154","Turkish Lawyers Are at Center of a Battle Over Muslim Head Coverings for Women","MENA","The murder victim was a lawyer who headed a local bar association in northeastern Turkey. He was also an observant Muslim who had threatened to expel two female Muslim lawyers for defying a ban against wearing head scarves in the courtroom. The killer was a Muslim fundamentalist who walked into the lawyer's office and shot him. The killer told the police later that his motive was to set ""an example for all those who would ban the turban."" For several years now, lawyers in Turkey have been at the center of the battle over the ""turban,"" as Turks refer to the scarves used by observant Muslim women to cover their hair as an expression of religious conviction. The battle, which was first fought in state universities in the 1980's, is still rumbling in the medical and other professions and in the civil service, where head scarves are often regarded as unsanitary, unseemly or just plain backward. Beyond questions of dress and life style, the killing of the lawyer in Gumushane on July 25 underscored the depth of debate about the role of Islam in Turkey's modern, secularized society. Arguments over what to wear are not new to Turkey. Under the Ottoman Empire, the state forced its citizens, male and female, to shed their robes, veils, turbans and slippers to appear more European and more modern. In 1925, two years after the Turkish Republic was founded, President Mustafa Kemal, known as Ataturk, went further by banning the fez, a red felt hat worn by men. The fez, Ataturk said in a speech, ""sat on the heads of our nation as an emblem of ignorance, negligence, fanaticism and hatred of progress and civilization."" Now the fight is over women's head coverings, which in recent years have become more common on the streets of Turkey's big cities, where the Islamic Welfare Party has achieved its biggest gains. For observant Muslim women, the scarf is not a restriction but the protection they require to leave home and work alongside men. Their supporters argue that the ban against head scarves is a human rights issue, a denial of a woman's right to work without having to sacrifice her religious principles. But others see the scarf itself as a political banner, manipulated by Islamic forces that are looking for ways to dismantle the secular state. ""The scarf has become a toy,"" said Turgut Kazan, president of the Istanbul Bar Association. ""This being a Muslim country, the scarf is open to manipulation."" For a women who wears a head scarf and wants to practice law, the ban against them in courtrooms means having to work as less than a full-fledged lawyer, often at less than full pay. Gumel Arslan, a 37-year-old lawyer, began covering her head when she was already well into her career, after she served as a judge and began working for a state agency in a provincial town. ""For me, it was an irreversible decision."" she said. ""I didn't want to take off my scarf just to make a concession to them."" When she transferred to Istanbul in 1986, Mrs. Arslan found that her clothes -- a multi-colored scarf tucked in over her forehead, and a loose-fitting, ankle-length raincoat -- provoked a strong reaction among her secular co-workers. ""People would call me names,"" she said. ""They would tell me, 'If you are so Muslim, you should go home and stay there, and have nothing to do with work,' or they would say my appearance annoyed them."" Mrs. Arslan now works for the Istanbul city government, which is controlled by the Welfare Party, and her male colleagues are careful to observe other rules that circumscribe the role of Muslim women in the workplace. Men and women, for instance, may not shake hands, and men must stand at least 6 feet away from their female co-workers. Mrs. Arslan accepts these rules as part of an ancient Islamic code that protects women from what is perceived as the sinful nature of men. ""Covering is not something that restricts freedom,"" she said. ""It is a measure taken against sin. Men are easily provoked, even just by looking at women. If women are not covered, it is like giving a man salt and then denying him water."" Kezban Hatemi, a female lawyer in Istanbul and an expert on Islam, maintains that the Koran itself does not obligate women to cover themselves. But she also argues that it should be a woman's right to dress according to her religious principles. ""If the state allowed people to practice religion as they want, there would be fewer scarves around,"" said Mrs. Hatemi, who does not wear one. ""The state has no business banning people from covering their heads. This is a kind of tyranny."" Mr. Kazan also argues that lifting the ban against head scarves would not produce a significant change in Turkish courtrooms. ""Of the 12,000 members of the Istanbul bar association, 4,000 are women,"" he said ""If we allowed scarves, there would be maybe 120 women who would wear them. This will do no damage."" Since the ban became a part of the Turkish Bar Association's dress code in 1985, several attempts to overturn it have failed in the courts, Mr. Kazan said. But he said that if some lawyers were willing to consider a change in the ban before the killing in Gumushane, 350 miles east of Ankara, they are now adamant in their resistance to what they see as an increasingly violent pressure campaign. Mr. Kazan cited evidence showing that the killer of the lawyer had not acted alone and that the victim had been selected precisely because he was a moderate Muslim, with a political future. ""They have a slogan, 'The hands that touch the turban should be broken,' "" he said, quoting Islamic militants. ""And that is the propaganda that led to the murder in Gumushane.""",1995,"Turkey"
"155","Defining Circumcision","MENA","To the Editor: Barry Ellsworth (letter, Dec. 19) equates male and female circumcision. The term ""female circumcision"" is a misnomer. This practice, more accurately known as female genital mutilation (FGM), involves the cutting of the clitoris and, in the more drastic forms, all external genitalia. The male equivalent of even the less severe forms of FGM would be castration, not circumcision. Mr. Ellsworth cites Egypt as a country that allowed FGM to be performed by doctors in hospitals, in an effort to defuse Western criticism. In fact, the medicalization of FGM was an effort to placate extremist sectors of the Islamic religious establishment. Recognizing its harmful effects, the Egyptian Minister of Health rescinded the directive on Oct. 17, 1995, and instructed hospitals not to perform FGM. Mr. Ellsworth is wrong in suggesting that we cannot influence the debate on FGM. Members of Equality Now's Women's Action Network have over the past year been in a dialogue with the Egyptian Minister of Health in which he himself has acknowledged the ""unacceptable disastrous repercussions on female child health.""

"156","Iran Offers an Islamic Way to Improve the Lot of Women","MENA","In a Teheran stadium last month, thousands of Iranian women marched to show their support for women's rights. But this was no protest rally. President Hashemi Rafsanjani was there, and he told the crowd of 80,000 that any effort to deny women their rights was ""doomed to failure."" The rally, celebrating Women's Week in Iran, was a sign that some restrictions on women during the past 15 years of fundamentalist rule are starting to ease. Iranian women are still subject to fines, and sometimes flogging, for violating the Islamic dress code, or hijab, and Islamic law denies equality between sexes. The Government still warns against the return to near-Western freedoms that women here experienced before the Islamic state took over in 1979. But it has introduced a series of reforms. In the last three years, a dormant family-planning program has been restarted. State-proposed prenuptial contracts give women the right to initiate divorce proceedings. Restrictions have been lifted on higher education to prepare women to work as engineers and assistants to judges. The numbers of women in the workplace and in institutions of higher education have increased. Thirty percent of Government employees are women, as are 40 percent of university students, up from about 12 percent in 1978. Faezeh Hashemi, the President's eldest daughter, has become the movement's chief spokeswoman. She said in a recent interview that she considers Islam liberating, adding that such restrictions as wearing traditional clothing need not impede a woman's career. The 31-year-old former volleyball coach organized the first Islamic Women's Olympics in Teheran in 1993. The event, which was closed to men and photographers, attracted 700 athletes from 11 countries. ""Our goal was to give women a sense of self-confidence,"" Ms. Hashemi said. ""In most of the Islamic world, women have cultural problems. They are regarded as a commodity, often forced into domesticity. For Iranian women, the values have changed."" But the athletic competition drew criticism from Iranian secularists who likened its seclusion to a harem and from fundamentalists who warned against perpetrating ""obscene Western values."" The celebrations for Women's Week included exhibitions by female artists, award ceremonies for female factory workers and amnesty for 190 women prisoners. The state also paid for 5,000 weddings. ""The women's movement in Western societies has been led astray because of temptation and the lack of fundamental teachings,"" Mr. Rafsanjani told the crowd in Azadi Stadium. ""Islam and the Revolution have envisioned far greater opportunities for women. To accomplish those goals we need more time."" The country's younger generation of officials, more open to the West, say the state wants to create Islamic programs that will be viewed as better than other alternatives. One Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the leadership believes ""that through propaganda they can establish their version of Islamic fundamentalism as complete and comprehensive to rival Western liberalism."" A professor of history at Teheran University, Mansoureh Ettehadieh, said: ""Because of the deteriorating economic situation, the state probably wants to appeal to women. One hundred years ago, no one thought that women would go to the university in Islamic covering. The hijab was the symbol of backwardness. Today women go skiing in Islamic hijab.""",1994,"Iran"
"157","A New Law in Iran Helps Divorced Women","MENA","A new law gives some women being divorced by their husbands the right to up to half the property accumulated during marriage, the head of the judiciary said today. The judge, Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, said in a sermon broadcast on Teheran radio that the law was intended to protect women whose husbands, having climbed the social ladder, wanted to leave them for younger women. While the law is limited in scope and awards are to be decided in court, the measure could still prove a significant advance for women in the face of Islamic family laws that give most rights to men. The new law was passed by a special council of about two dozen officials, most of them clerics. It applies only if the wife has fulfilled her marital duties, the judge said. Complaints by divorced women who find themselves penniless with little recourse to law is a recurring theme in Iran. While the law, in line with Islam, does not question that divorce is only the husband's right, the authorities have taken steps to discourage easy divorce.",1994,"Iran"
"158","Turks Clash Over Defense of Virginity Tests","MENA","Outraged Turkish feminists are demanding the resignation of the Cabinet minister in charge of women's affairs after she defended the traditional practice of subjecting women to virginity tests. In rural areas and urban neighborhoods populated by migrants from the countryside, parents and future husbands often take young women to be tested before their marriage, and sometimes if they are suspected of having had premarital relations. The minister, Isilay Saygin, has often seemed proud of her anti-feminist stance, asserting at various times that ""women don't want to take part in politics"" and that ""three women don't equal one man."" Her appointment to Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's Cabinet in June provoked some protests, but the campaign for her removal began in earnest after the publication last week of an interview she gave to an Istanbul newspaper. Asked what she thought of virginity testing, she replied: ""It doesn't bother me. I do whatever Turkish tradition and customs require of the family."" ""Educating children is the duty of the father and mother,"" she asserted. ""The state is the father."" Reminded that some young women have committed suicide rather than face the results of virginity tests, Ms. Saygin said: ""Girls who committed suicide because they were forced to take a virginity test would have committed suicide anyway. I don't think this is really important. Five or three girls, it doesn't matter."" These and other comments infuriated feminists. ""To be able to say that three or five women might die is not something out of the blue,"" said Halime Guner, co-founder of a women's group called Flying Broom. ""She has always been like that."" Even one of Ms. Saygin's senior aides, Selma Acuner, disavowed her comments. ""Virginity tests are a violation of individual rights,"" Ms. Acuner said. ""Reactions are pouring in to our ministry."" The case may prove a boon to the small but growing women's movement in Turkey. It has brought feminist groups together with more mainstream organizations such as the Republican Women's Association, which is dedicated to promoting the sexual equality that Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic, decreed in the 1920's. ""Women are not reluctant to participate in politics,"" the chairman of the association, Senal Saruhan, said after Ms. Saygin's interview was published. ""They have been treated as second-class citizens."" Turkish law makes no reference to the practice of virginity tests, but many parents consider them a reasonable way to control daughters. ""Sometimes headmasters of schools bring girls in for tests, and if it is found that the girls are not virgins, they can be expelled,"" said Sahika Yuksel, an Istanbul doctor who is among those calling for Ms. Saygin's resignation. ""Police often bring women in for tests if they are found in a flirtatious or romantic situation,"" she said. ""If they are not virgins they can be charged with practicing prostitution or brought back to their families, where they often face serious problems."" ""No one should have an interest in whether an adult woman is a virgin or not,"" Dr. Yuksel said. ""Unfortunately, in certain countries, including Turkey, virginity is considered an important sign of honor."" Ms. Saygin has declined to comment on the dispute, and Government spokesmen today also declined.",1998,"Turkey"
"159","Ban Virginity Tests","MENA","To the Editor: Re ""Turks Clash Over Defense of Virginity Tests"" (news article, Jan. 8): In 1994 Human Right Watch worked with women's rights activists in Turkey to show the extent to which Turkish officials condone and carry out forced virginity tests on women and girls. This is not just a problem of parents following tradition. Our investigation found officials forcing virginity tests on female security detainees, women applying for state jobs and single women staying in hotels or dining out. The Government's own use of forced virginity exams reinforces the belief that society's interest in regulating women's virginity trumps women's rights to the integrity of their own bodies. In 1994 the former minister of women's affairs denounced virginity tests. Now Isilay Saygin, her successor, appears happy to defend violating women's human rights as business as usual. REGAN E.

"160","Cry of Muslim Women for Equal Rights Is Rising","MENA","The day Rashida was called to family court, she found herself in a scene that nearly stopped her heart. There, before the judge, was her husband of 10 years, father of her two children, the man she thought so enlightened when they first met at the university. That same man, she had just learned, was seeking the court's consent to marry a second wife. It took just minutes for the judge to approve. He ruled that the petitioner, who was a senior Government official, earned enough to maintain two families. Since her husband's second wedding, two years ago, Rashida has begged him in vain for a divorce and child support. Although she lives alone, she dares not think of remarrying. If she did, under Morocco's Islamic law, she would be likely to lose her children. ""This case is cruel, but it's mild compared to many others,"" said Fatima Elmaghnaoui, a counselor at a legal aid center for women. Rashida, who feared the consequences if her full name were published, still receives occasional checks from her husband. But that day, two women went to the center who had been repudiated by their husbands and left in the street with their children. A 14-year-old girl had been raped, leaving her pregnant and with nowhere to go. She could not return home. ""Her oldest brother said he would kill her for dishonoring the family,"" Mrs. Elmaghnaoui said. Such cases are common -- and not just in Morocco, which likes to see itself as one of the more cultured and humane lands among Arab nations. They occur throughout the Islamic world, where texts of the Koran and a range of appendages attached in later ages are invoked to deny equal rights to women. Protests against the humiliation of women in Islamic societies are hardly new. But more Islamic women's groups are speaking out against what they call the Muslim system of apartheid. The status of Muslim women varies widely. While some have gained rights, others have recently lost them. But like a deep fault line, the question of a woman's place runs through most of the Islamic world. Women and what they are forbidden to do or wear are at the heart of the fundamentalist policies in Afghanistan and Iran and are part of the agenda of the violent Islamist uprising in Algeria. The use of head scarves, an Islamic symbol, has been revived as an issue in universities in secular Turkey. And demands to abolish discrimination in Muslim family laws are testing official promises for greater democracy in Morocco, Tunisia and Malaysia. But even if these issues are ubiquitous, there has been little motion. ""Islamic countries have modernized many laws -- in the economy, education, commerce, politics, you name it,"" said Wassyla Tamzali, an Algerian lawyer and a specialist in Arab women's rights at Unesco. ""But there is practically no movement in the status of women. When it comes to women's rights, religion and theology are invoked. ""Change is so difficult because in Islam, women symbolize tradition and cultural identity. It is as if the whole burden of the Islamic tradition rests on their shoulders."" But a public, if relatively quiet, rebellion is under way. The activists do not get much limelight: they usually do not march in protest, either because it is forbidden or because they fear a backlash. But as International Women's Day, on March 8, approached this year, there was a multitude of debates, conferences and television programs about the issues across North Africa, from Morocco to Egypt. Because the movement is informal and ad hoc, statistics about participation or impact are hard to come by. Almost by definition, it revolves around educated women. In Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, where women rank among the more emancipated of the Arab world, activists say the United Nations international women's conference in Beijing in 1995 was an important catalyst for defining the issues and planning action. But most important, they say, support has grown because women are caught in the growing contradictions and shifts within Islamic societies. One such shift, in the countries around the Mediterranean, has been the enormous migration from the countryside to the cities in recent years. As a result, more women now go to universities and work as doctors and lawyers as well as in factories and offices. But the archaic laws linger. ""Legally we are still as helpless as the illiterate girls on the farms,"" said Nouzha Skali, a Casablanca pharmacist. ""We are all legal minors, and we depend on permission of our fathers, brothers or husbands."" Educated or not, a Moroccan women needs the permission of a male relative to marry, name her children or work. She inherits half as much as her male siblings. She can be forced into marriage or polygamy and can be beaten or repudiated -- which is a man's exercise of his unilateral right to end the marriage -- without recourse. In conversations with Moroccan women -- social workers in Rabat, artists in Marrakesh -- and with female lawyers from several Arab countries who recently gathered in Paris, all agreed that the rise of Islamic fundamentalism had slowed and complicated their fight. But some believe that it has clarified the need to anchor any new rights in civil rather than religious law. ""Muslim feminists have long argued that it is not the religion but the male interpretation of the Koran that keeps women oppressed, along with the texts that were added on in the Middle Ages,"" said Mrs. Tamzali. ""So the way to reform seemed to be that we had to re-examine and reinterpret the religious texts. But efforts to reform Islam from within keep failing."" Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria, who have led a violent campaign for five years, and in Afghanistan, who have altogether cloistered women, have recently demonstrated how easy it is to turn back the clock by invoking religion. Many women now feel that they must fight to expand and change secular law, rather than reform the Sharia, the Islamic legal code, Mrs. Tamzali said. It is a discussion that means little to Zoubida Mhider, 48, who lives in poverty in Rabat. She is illiterate, like almost 70 percent of Moroccan women. In the waiting room of Annajda, a legal aid office in Rabat, she whispered that she had been beaten by her husband for so long that she finally left with her 11 children. For almost four years, Mrs. Mhider said, she has been going to court to beg for help with getting a divorce and seeking child support. Her husband usually fails to show up for court appointments, and the court has not pressed him. Two of the children have married, and she and the younger children have been getting by only on money her married daughter sometimes sends from the Netherlands. ""I just want this settled,"" she said, her body shaking under her long robe. Fatima Zahra Tamouh, a professor of African history at the University of Rabat, said that in Morocco and a number of countries, migration to the cities had brought more education for women but also more violence, repudiation and divorce. ""In the countryside, couples rarely lived alone,"" she said. ""A husband was accountable to the woman's family -- to her father, her brothers. But there is more abuse and more divorce and repudiation now that couples live alone. The problem is we've got a society more based on individuals without the laws to go with it."" In Rabat, Morocco's spacious and sunlit capital, women's groups are mobilizing to get divorce and child custody rules moved from the Mudawana, the Muslim family law, into the civil code. In 1993 women collected a million signatures in this nation of 28 million people to support such reform. King Hassan II agreed. But the reforms, drawn up by an all-male panel of theologians, have made little difference. This time, women say, they want a role in drafting the changes. ""For a man in Morocco, it is easier to get rid of his wife than to fire an employee,"" said Mrs. Skali, the pharmacist. Lawyers say that for a man it can take a few weeks to get a divorce and for a woman, five years or more. Equal rights in divorce and abolishing the one-sided act of repudiation are only one aspect of Muslim women's concerns, but in the big cities they affect almost 50 percent of couples, said Mrs. Skali, who also is president of the Association of Democratic Women, a rights group. ""We want to ring the alarm bell, because divorce is affecting our whole society,"" she said. ""The women are left on their own, with no support. It's one reason why we are seeing more and more street children.""",1998,"Morocco"
"161","Moroccans and Women: Two Rallies","MENA","Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of two Moroccan cities today in rival demonstrations over a government plan that would grant more rights to women. In the capital, Rabat, between 200,000 and 300,000 people representing women's groups, human rights movements and political parties marched in support of the plan, some chanting, ""No to reactionaries."" At least six government ministers took part in the march, which ended with a concert. In Casablanca, officials said that at least 200,000 people -- twice that, according to observers -- demonstrated against the plan, which would offer women greater educational opportunities and help those going through divorce. ""We defend Islam with our bodies and souls,"" the crowds chanted as they marched -- men and women in separate columns -- through downtown Casablanca under the eyes of the police and soldiers. ""Men and women are equal before God,"" they chanted. The Casablanca march was supported by Abdessalam Yassine, the founder of the banned Justice and Charity Movement, who has been under house arrest outside Rabat for a decade. His movement has grown increasingly vocal since last July when King Mohammed VI took the throne following the death of his father, King Hassan II. The new monarch has moved quickly to bring a variety of social and human rights reforms to his kingdom. The plan that provoked the demonstration today has sharply divided Moroccans in the year since it was announced. Among other things, it would fully replace the practice of repudiation -- or automatic divorce by a husband -- with court divorces, and provide for equal division of money and property. It would also support a literacy program for rural Moroccan women, 60 percent of whom are illiterate.  http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Morocco"
"162","Egypt Makes It Easier for Women to Divorce Husbands","MENA","After an impassioned debate about Islam, the family and the role of women, Parliament voted today to give women the ability to divorce their husbands without having to first prove to judges that they had been mistreated. President Hosni Mubarak, whose party controls the 454-member Parliament, had proposed the hotly debated legislation and is widely expected to sign it in a week. Opponents of the change argued that Islam, the dominant religion, gives only men the right to initiate divorces. They said extending the right to women, who were described as emotionally capricious and vengeful in discussions in Parliament and the media, would lead to a mass breakdown of family life. Proponents of the change said that even the Prophet Muhammad had allowed an unhappy woman to end her marriage against her husband's wishes, although she was first ordered to return her dowry. Many leading clerics supported the change, including the government-appointed mufti and the sheik of Al Azhar University in Cairo, the oldest Islamic teaching institution in the world. ""This is a victory for women who spend years and years of their lives seeking divorce and never getting it,"" Hosn Shah, a writer and one of the newly vocal women who campaigned for the changes, said. ""These rules were in the Islamic law 1,400 years ago. But it is men who do not apply them."" Under the measure, divorce would still be more complicated for a woman than a man, reflecting the conservative nature of this male-oriented society. A woman would have two choices. She could use the current procedure, which requires a wife to have witnesses to prove to a judge in family court that her husband had behaved badly enough to justify divorce, perhaps because he beat her or had failed to provide for her. That process is usually protracted and usually ends in a ruling against the wife. Still, 1.5 million such requests are filed each year, according to government statistics. A new option would be to demand a divorce based on simple incompatibility. But a woman would have to wait six months if she has children or three months if she does not while a judge tries to reconcile the partners. If she still wants the divorce, a judge would have to grant it. But the woman would have to return all money, property and gifts that she received in the marriage and forgo alimony. ""This will only lead to more and more splits within the society,"" Ayman Nour, a member of Parliament who opposed the change, said. ""This law will instigate women to be corrupt. A woman could just get together with another man and agree to divorce her husband."" A Muslim man in Egypt can now end a marriage by saying, ""I divorce thee,"" three times or, in a bureaucratic version of the same ancient Islamic custom, by filing a paper with a government registrar that declares he is divorcing his wife. Under the change, a man would have to file the divorce paper. The situation for Christians, 6 percent of the population, would remain burdensome, because religious courts administer family law. Unless they can prove adultery, Christian women are rarely granted divorces. http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Egypt"
"163","Egypt's Women Win Equal Rights to Divorce","MENA","The narrow corridors of Family Court were once painted a cheerful red, but now they are pitted and stained with a dull brown patina of grime and the smoke from countless acrid cigarettes. The stories told in these trash-strewn hallways are just as dismal: children abandoned, families impoverished and women trapped in marriages they can escape only with permission from their husbands. ""I can't find my husband,"" said Saida Muhammad Osman, a careworn 50-year-old woman perched on the surviving half of a broken plastic chair in the crowded hallway of the courthouse in central Cairo. ""Every few years he comes back for a few days, but usually I am on my own with my children."" Mrs. Osman's hopes have been as meager as her circumstances. She dreams of getting a divorce, required to enable her to collect her dead father's pension -- hardly a princely sum at the equivalent of just over $6 a month. Knowing her husband can delay a final judgment for years, she feared that any relief would come too late to do her family much good. But change is about to shake Egypt's crowded and melancholy courtrooms. Beginning on Wednesday, Egypt will put in place one of the Muslim world's most far-reaching reforms of family law. Among countries in the region, only Tunisia also makes divorce an equal opportunity alternative to an unhappy marriage. ""Before this, I really did not want my own daughter to get married because I saw again and again the trap that a woman can be in in this country,"" said Muhammad Amer, a Cairo lawyer who is considered an expert on Islamic family law and who lobbied for the changes. ""Now I'm not worried, because she can get rid of the man when she wants."" With the new law, a woman will be able to divorce her husband, with or without his assent. And she will also be able to call on the Egyptian government to garnishee her husband's wages if he refuses to provide for her. If he disappears or cannot pay a court-ordered living allowance, she will be able to draw from a special state bank to keep her family afloat. When they were proposed by President Hosni Mubarak late last year, the changes drew fierce opposition. Conservative lawmakers said women were too flighty to be entrusted with the option of no-fault divorce. The proposals also were widely lampooned in the press as the work of man-hating feminists. But an alliance of moderate Muslim clerics, women's advocates, civil court judges and divorce lawyers endorsed the reforms. To head off a backlash from Islamic hard-liners, they mounted a public relations effort to convince people that the law is a modern rendering of the equal rights that Islam bestows on women. ""Maybe Egyptian society is not in the best condition now to discuss this law,"" said Fathi Naguib, an assistant justice minister who drafted the law.  ""But every society needs a shock, one that doesn't go so far that it can't be absorbed but one that is still a little step forward. This was a necessary and overdue shock."" Family law is generally based on Shariah, or the Islamic legal code, in Muslim countries, including Egypt. This has come to mean that a Muslim man can get a divorce automatically. But a woman must prove to a court that her husband beats her, is a drug addict, is sterile or does not support the family. In practice, though, they are often stymied by judges who discount their complaints, according to reports by private organizations and the State Department. Even when she is granted a divorce, a woman may not be free because her husband can appeal the decree indefinitely. In Egypt, where the civil and criminal codes are an amalgam of secular and Islamic law, there have been occasional attempts at reform. In 1979, President Anwar el-Sadat issued a decree allowing a woman to divorce her husband if she objected to him taking an additional wife. But the decree was later declared unconstitutional on procedural grounds. Mr. Sadat's successor, Mr. Mubarak, did not try to restore that law, but did repeal an Ottoman-era rule making it a crime for a woman to run away from an abusive husband. The impetus for the new, more sweeping change in Egypt's laws came from people who have spent years watching the system in action. ""I dreamed of having this new law for 28 years, ever since I was just a small judge working in the field of family law and seeing how women suffer from the system,"" said Mr. Naguib. ""I saw how they could stay in the courts 12, 14, 15 years without getting a divorce. It was very painful to witness."" Little has changed in Egypt's divorce courts, where 1.2 million cases are filed a year, but only 71,000 are granted by overworked judges. Fathi Shaheen, a gaunt man of 75, has made his living for 40 years at the Shobra courthouse helping illiterate women prepare divorce requests.  He said he had seen more tears than he cared to remember. ""These men, they are greedy and they want to make the woman suffer,"" he said recently, ""so they keep filing appeal after appeal. In my time, men saw women as something sacred."" A few feet away, a young woman named Samia leaned against a filthy wall. People jostled around her, trying to spot their names on a handwritten list of 150 divorce cases to be heard that day by a single judge. Samia, who was granted a divorce three years ago on the ground that her husband beat her, was an island of resigned calm. ""I'm an expert at this,"" she said. ""I go to court all the time because my husband keeps appealing our divorce."" Her mother chimed in. ""Why can they keep appealing?"" she said. ""Appeals are for murderers and criminals. Meanwhile, the man goes out and gets married and has a happy life, while the wife has to wait."" Even with Egypt's new law, a wife who wants a divorce over the objections of her husband will have to return to him any money or property that he paid her upon the marriage.  That provision was the price paid for the support of leading Muslim authorities. It refers to a decision by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who once permitted an unhappy woman to leave her husband but required her to return the garden he had given her when they married. ""When you touch a sensitive area like this, you must speak to society in its language,"" Mr. Naguib said. ""And here, the language of religion is most convincing.""  http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Egypt"

Women are routinely beaten, stoned or killed for refusing to conform to Taliban rules -- rules as absurd as not allowing women to show their ankles. Women are often kept from receiving humanitarian aid because they lack the male relative necessary to obtain it. As male doctors generally cannot treat female patients, women often do not have access to necessary health care.

"167","Compressed Data; A Feminist News Service Is Reaching Out in Arabic","MENA","When Women's eNews, the New York-based feminist news service, examined data last summer identifying the location of its visitors, the United States was the No. 1 country of origin, followed by Britain, Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia, a country where women's activities are restricted by the government. ""We were stunned and thrilled that we would have an audience in a nation where women can't drive,"" said Rita Henley Jensen, the editor in chief of the three-year-old site (www.womensenews.org). What's more, the site, which provides features about abortion rights, domestic violence and strategies for single motherhood, has almost as many visitors in Qatar, a neighbor of Saudi Arabia. Women's eNews was working this month to begin an Arabic site aimed at Arab and Muslim women in the Middle East and the United States (www.awomensenews.org). The most prominent article for the site describes efforts by Israeli and Palestinian women to encourage their peers to discuss peace and coexistence issues they believe male negotiators have neglected. Another article examines Egyptian women's efforts to win divorce rights. And a third is on the sewing workshops where Palestinian women earn a living in the absence of male breadwinners. ""I'm not sure there is a site that provides news the way we do,"" said Mona Eltahawy, the managing editor of the Arabic site, who is Egyptian-born. There may be a reason for limited competition. Two Harvard Law School researchers last summer reported that of 64,557 Web pages they examined, the Saudi government was blocking 2,038, including women's health sites and offerings like the Women in History section of Encyclopaedia Britannica Online (www.women.eb.com); a Planned Parenthood site (www.teenwire .com); and iVillage.com. ""The data we've gathered confirm that women's rights is a sensitive issue to the Saudi government,"" said Jonathan Zittrain, one of the authors of the Harvard report, adding that the filtering seems aimed more at ""making a statement rather than really trying to stop the citizenry from getting the information."" Ms. Jensen sounds resigned to the likelihood of filtering. ""I would feel that it demonstrates why Women's eNews-in-Arabic needs to exist,"" she said. But, she added, ""all of our stories can be delivered via e-mail.""   JOAN OLECK",2003,"Saudi Arabia"
"168","THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-30-03; A Woman's Work?","MENA","In a way, it is no surprise that more women than men oppose the war with Iraq. The gender gap on issues of war and military spending has been obvious at least since pollsters first thought to measure such a thing. On the eve of the gulf war in 1991, 67 percent of American men favored an attack on Iraq, for example, compared with 45 percent of women. On the eve of this war, two-thirds of American men supported it, compared with half of American women, according to a poll by The Washington Post. The only real exception to this pattern of opinion came right after Sept. 11, when roughly equal numbers of women and men favored military action in what was then said to be the terrorist stronghold, Afghanistan, against the man who was then said to be the enemy, Osama bin Laden. Those were the days when choosy mothers were choosing Cipro, when maternalism briefly acquired a martial edge and when a shared sense of vulnerability and outrage swamped some of the familiar political divides. Still, if it isn't particularly surprising that women as a group are more skeptical about the war than men, it is surprising how little the arguments of women who oppose the war as women -- rather than, say, as citizens -- have changed over the years and how ill adapted they are to an era in which female soldiers make up a substantial minority of the fighting force in Iraq. Twelve years ago, 40,000 women went to the gulf, and as anyone watching this war on TV can see, there are many more there this time. Yet women's opposition to the war is still framed much as it has always been: women are antiwar naturals because it is men who do the fighting or because, as the 19th-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton put it, war could never have ""emanated from the mother soul."" And the gender gap still gets more attention than do other, potentially more interesting, divisions over the war, like the generational gap some pollsters have noted. (Older adults are more likely to oppose the war in Iraq than younger ones.) The modern-day equivalent of this gender mysticism has a lot to say about hormones. ""The peace machine becomes estrogen-dominant because the war machine runs on testosterone,"" as a columnist in a Canadian paper explained. Mother Earth and, of course, Mars and Venus are also popular touchstones. ""On the question of invading Iraq, men really are from Mars and women from Venus,"" a writer opined in The Mercury News in San Jose, Calif. ""Just as the ancient Roman god and goddess disagreed on matters of war and love, the two sexes are arguing today on whether armed conflict is the answer in Iraq."" Never mind that half of all American women are for the war (some of them, presumably, because they see a better future for women in a reordered Arab world), which means that ""the sexes"" can hardly be arguing, though individual men and women surely are. And the actor Danny Glover told a rally in Los Angeles in early March that ""women are most affected by war. It is the real caregivers of this Mother Earth who are most devastated."" A curious sentiment given that men, still, are the vast majority of combatants and that bombs do not discriminate by sex. CodePink, the women's antiwar mobilization with a sense of humor (its name derives from the color-coded terror alert system), strives for a more sophisticated explanation of why women are especially suited to antiwar protest. ""Women have been guardians of life,"" its Web site explains, but not because they're ""better or purer or more innately nurturing."" Because of ""our responsibility to the next generation, because of our own love for our families and communities,"" women ""understand the love of a mother in Iraq for her children and the driving desire of that child for life."" But surely these are universal feelings, and protecting the vulnerable -- civilians in a war zone, for example -- isn't just women's work. When Elizabeth Cady Stanton was prophesying that if the ""feminine element"" had been allowed into politics, there would be no war -- only mercy and love -- that was a fantasy that could be indulged in with impunity. There were no women in politics -- no Margaret Thatchers, no Condoleezza Rices, no one like Tony Blair's minister for women, who used the occasion of International Women's Day this year to warn against ""appeasement"" of Iraq. When Virginia Woolf wrote in ""Three Guineas"" that ""as a woman, I have no country"" and that any war fought for ""our"" country would only be ""to gratify a sex instinct which I cannot share, to procure benefits which I have not shared and probably will not share,"" women in Europe and America were in fact systematically shut out of positions of power. When Vietnam War protesters formed a group called Another Mother for Peace and promulgated images of drooping sunflowers that read ""War Is Not Healthy for Children and Other Living Things,"" the moral authority of the mother was still the major, in some cases the only, justification for women to speak out. There are plenty of reasons to be against this war, but in America today, few of those reasons have much to do with gender. We hold onto the notion that women are peculiarly adapted for the antiwar camp because it has the attractions of all cliches -- it's homey, it's simple, it contains a kernel of truth. Tapping into the frustrations of women -- with men, with their own lives -- is a way of reaching out to more people than might be attracted by a less encumbered, more policy-oriented antiwar message. And it's easier to cite women's maternal morality and Cassandra-like vision than to make hard arguments about this war in particular as opposed to war in general. But clinging to the notion of women as the world's peacemakers means lauding instinct, not thought. And it comes dangerously close to the idea that women cannot choose between just and unjust wars, nor disagree with one another on which is which.",2003,"Iraq"
"169","U.S. Envoy Promotes Role of Iraqi Women","MENA","L. Paul Bremer III, the chief American administrator in Iraq, dropped into this holy city on Monday to give the revolution a gentle nudge. Mr. Bremer shook hands with a group of Iraqi women, some of whom needed the permission of their husbands before they could attend the day's events. He posed with them in pictures, with some wearing the traditional head-to-toe abayas. He inspected a range of women's projects being realized with American money. With about 100 Iraqi women seated before him, Mr. Bremer promised America's continued support for the profound changes in the works for Iraq's women. ''Anyone seeing all this talent and ability here, they would recognize that barriers placed in the way of women are barriers to the development and growth and prosperity of Iraq, and indeed the Arab world,'' he told them. ''We in the coalition are committed to continuing to promote women's rights in Iraq.'' The Iraqi women gave Mr. Bremer a hefty round of applause. The husbands, who had been asked to stand in the back, clapped too. The event was the opening of the Zainab al-Hawraa Center for Women's Rights, a former Baath Party building converted with $163,000 in American money to a place where women can acquire job skills and learn about their political rights. It is a modest place, a four-story building, in this city famous for its Shiite shrines. The center has a library, a computer room and an area for sewing lessons. But the center is a small part of a much larger effort under way, backed by the American government, to broaden the opportunities for women and ensure them a role in governing their country. The most striking proposal, now included in a draft of Iraq's transitional constitution, asks that 40 percent of seats in the National Assembly be set aside for women. It would also ensure that men and women are treated equally under the law. Such proposals are regarded by many here as too much too soon. When the draft began circulating last month among members of the Iraqi Governing Council, there were grumbles that the language about women needed to be scaled back. Mr. Bremer, whose word carries the extra weight of veto power over the temporary constitution, seemed unbowed by those complaints. In his speech he cited a recent United Nations report that attributed many of the Arab world's human and economic problems to poor treatment of women. ''The Arab world is largely depriving itself of the creativity and productivity of half of its citizens,'' he said. In an interview afterward, he said that while he was ''uneasy'' with the notion of quotas, he believed it necessary for Iraqi women to have a ''very substantial presence'' in political institutions. ''You have to have more than a token representation,'' Mr. Bremer said. ''There has to be a kind of critical mass, where the women draw confidence from each other's presence.'' Mr. Bremer pointed out that women are a clear majority in Iraq, in large part because of the deaths of so many men in the wars, foreign and domestic, of Saddam Hussein. Many of the women who gathered here were widows, and they seemed especially grateful for the place. One was Nawal Jabar, a 44-year-old mother of five, whose husband died in 1987 in the war with Iran. Since then, Ms. Jabar said, she has depended on her brother and father to support her family, which includes a 24-year-old disabled son. Her father, who is elderly, is now ill as well, and so Ms. Jabar's quest for a better life has taken on an added urgency. ''I have to learn a skill,'' she said, before Mr. Bremer's speech. ''I will do anything to support my family.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2004,"Iraq"
"170","Iraqi Women's Window of Opportunity for Political Gains Is Closing","MENA","Emboldened by the fall of Saddam Hussein, Iraqi women are pushing for political freedoms many of them have never enjoyed. But as they do, a rising tide of religious zeal threatens even the small victories they have won. Ibtisam Ali and her sister, Raghad, have spearheaded a petition drive demanding a large percentage of seats for women in a new national assembly. But when Raghad, 25, tried to run for local office, the men at the candidate registration office informed her that women could not be candidates. ''I was frightened of the people in my neighborhood,'' Raghad said. ''They looked at me so strangely, like I thought I was equal to men. I'm afraid of everything, from gossip to violence. It just kills the ambitions inside.'' Women, secular and religious, from all ethnic groups, now run for office and demand a fair share of representation in a country where they make up 60 percent of the population. Yet new religious activism in Iraq has aggravated traditional attitudes about women's roles in society. The 18-member committee drafting the new constitution does not include any women, according to members of the Iraqi Governing Council. The council recently passed a nonbinding resolution calling for Shariah, or Islamic law, to govern family issues, which Iraq's justice minister said would damage the rights of Iraqi women. And on the streets, more women, even little girls, are covering their heads and bodies, largely because of a fear of harassment and violence, said a range of secular and religious women. ''Women are waking up and getting it now,'' said Manal Omar, the Iraq country director of Women for Women International, a Washington-based group that helps women in countries newly emerged from war. ''They realize that if they don't move now, they will pay the price for years and years to come.'' For 35 years, Iraqi women were able to get university degrees, study overseas and hold high-level professional posts. They were actually discouraged from wearing the hijab, the traditional Muslim head scarf. But in the 1990's, as Mr. Hussein embraced Islam as a source of credibility in the Arab world, his government clamped down on women. Although they continued to attend schools and hold jobs, they were no longer allowed to travel on their own. In general, said Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi-American who is president of Women for Women International, in Washington, women abandoned public life, leaving politics to men. More women started to cover themselves, although wearing hijab became the norm only after Mr. Hussein's ouster. Many Iraqi women believed that with the arrival of the Americans, they would gain more rights. In Hilla, about 60 miles south of Baghdad, women are pressing for those rights, with the help of some men, and battling the anger roused by their efforts. One recent afternoon, Ibtisam Ali stood before the staff of the Human Rights Association of Babylon asking for signatures on a petition demanding that 40 percent of seats in the new national assembly be set aside for women. The signature drive has spread across the country. Ms. Ali, a tall, eloquent woman, was reluctant to push too hard after a man recently told her that women did not deserve equal representation because they were not equal to men. ''If, after all this, the governing council gives us 10 or 20 percent, that will be a blessing,'' she told the group. Hafidh Mejbas, an older man who works for the human rights association, coached her, saying: ''Don't mention 10 or 20 percent all the time. Insist on the 40 percent.'' Ms. Ali cheered up and gave petitions to men and women so they might gather signatures. She has been to villages and gotten signatures from women washing clothes on the river banks. She has persuaded their sheiks, or tribal leaders, to sign, too, she said. But at the same human rights center is a friend of Ms. Ali's who was badly beaten by some men over the summer after she went to the market with her head uncovered. The woman is still too ashamed to talk. Thanaa Salman, a 27-year-old school principal, pushed her way into local politics. She was elected to her neighborhood council, but the elections for its presidency were held without her knowledge, she said. So she contacted the Americans who had organized the vote and demanded a new election. It was held, and she won the presidency by a narrow margin. Still, men tell her every day that she is destined to fail. ''Iraqi women now have more freedom, more opportunity, so, more problems,'' Ms. Salman said. The broader political concerns of the women in Hilla reflect those of most politically active women in Iraq. There is the issue of representation, especially on the all-male constitutional committee. Women like Ibtisam Ali say they do not trust male politicians to adequately protect freedom of religion and expression in a new constitution. Those suspicions have arisen lately because of efforts by religious parties in the Governing Council to push through Resolution 137, which would abolish a 1959 law that the justice minister, Hashim Abdul-Rahman al-Shibli, says drew on the most generous protections for women and children from different schools of Shariah. ''Women don't want clerics to write the constitution,'' Ms. Salman said. According to Mr. Shibli, the resolution would stipulate that a Shiite woman, for example, would have her divorce adjudicated by Shiite law, a Sunni by Sunni law. Besides atomizing the law into many laws, Mr. Shibli noted, such a move would strip every woman of some rights. Inheritance rights for women are more generous under Shiite law than Sunni, but divorce protections are better under Sunni law. So a Shiite woman would still have some good inheritance protections but would see her divorce rights diminished. ''It will have a negative impact on women's lives,'' Mr. Shibli said. The resolution has been frozen for now by the Americans who run Iraq, and a move is on by some Governing Council members to void it entirely. But supporters of it, like the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, indicate that they would like to bring it up again once Iraq gains its sovereignty, because they feel its respects the diversity of Iraq. ''Anyone can respect their own law: Shia, Sunni, Christians,'' said Adel Abdel Mahdi, the top aide to Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a Governing Council member from Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. ''This doesn't take privileges from people, but gives them instead.'' The new possibilities and dangers collide in the life of Fatennal Ramahi. Fluent in English and German, Ms. Ramahi stopped working for the last 13 years because she was unwilling to inform on foreign employers. Now, she works for Women for Women. Depressed about staying at home, Ms. Ramahi, a 45-year-old mother of four, began wearing the hijab, a few years ago. When she began work, she took off the scarf. ''I feel back to my own self,'' she said in her office, her lush auburn hair brushing the neck of her black sweater. Pointing at her smiling face, she said, ''This is the real me.'' Though she is a religious Muslim who prays and fasts, her decision to take off her scarf amounts to a grave transgression in the eyes of some, and they let her know it. ''The other day, I was crossing the street when a boy who was the same age as my son began shouting at me, very, very bad words,'' Ms. Ramahi said, her smile vanishing as she looked down at her desk, unwilling to repeat those words. ''I hear those words in my head still. I keep asking myself, 'Why didn't you talk to him?' Then I thought, 'I don't dare.' ''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2004,"Iraq"
"171","Saudi Arabia's Top Cleric Condemns Calls for Women's Rights","MENA","In a mounting struggle between reformists and conservatives, Saudi Arabia's highest religious authority has denounced calls for greater women's rights as a violation of Islamic teachings. The official, Grand Mufti Sheik Abdulaziz bin Abdullah al-Sheik, also sharply criticized women who mixed unveiled among men at an economic conference this week in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. He said such behavior was a cause of ""evil and catastrophe."" His comments, which amounted to a religious edict, were broadcast late Tuesday after the three-day conference in Jidda, which gave women a rare public platform to voice their grievances in the kingdom, the birthplace of Islam. ""This is prohibited for all,"" Sheik Abdulaziz said. ""I severely condemn this matter and warn of grave consequences. I am pained by such shameful behaviour in the country of the two holy mosques,"" in Mecca and Medina. ""Allowing women to mix with men is the root of every evil and catastrophe,"" he said. ""It is highly punishable. Mixing of men and women is a reason for greater decadence and adultery."" He also criticized the appearance of women ""without wearing the hijab ordered by God."" His comments seemed to be an attempt by Saudi Arabia's religious authorities to limit political reform in the conservative kingdom. One Saudi academic who has followed Saudi Arabia's cautious reform effort said religious leaders monitored even ""trivial things"" like women's roles in the Jidda conference. ""If they see this as a violation of our purity and values and believe it opens the door of corruption, what about more concrete reforms?"" he asked. ""This could stop the reform process."" Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto ruler in Saudi Arabia, pledged last week to press ahead with reform but said changes would be gradual and would conform with Islam. ""This country is either Muslim or nothing at all,"" he said. A leading businesswoman, Lubna Olayan, opened the conference on Saturday with a rallying call for equality in Saudi Arabia, her loose head scarf slipping occasionally off her head onto her shoulders as she spoke. ""My vision is of a country in which any Saudi citizen, irrespective of gender, who is serious about finding employment can find a job in the field for which he or she is best qualified,"" Ms. Olayan said. She also called for mutual respect regardless of ""social class, religion or gender."" Women applauded a speech by the former President Bill Clinton, who said that Saudi Arabia could not fight the ""tide of change"" and that the Prophet Muhammad would have let his wife drive if cars had existed 1,400 years ago. Women are banned from driving in Saudi Arabia. Although men and women at the meeting were segregated by a screen, women were able to cross into the men's section and mingle, much to the anger of conservatives. ""I decree that Muslims should beware, be alert and avoid being carried away by this propaganda, which destroys religion, morals and virtues,"" Sheik Abdulaziz said. ""What was published in some newspapers about this being the start of liberating the Saudi woman -- such talk is null and void. One's duty is to obey Shariah by complying with orders and shunning that which is forbidden."" Shariah refers to Islamic law. Saudi Arabia is ruled by an alliance of the House of Saud and powerful Wahhabi religious authorities.",2004,"Saudi Arabia"
"172","Small Victories in Afghanistan","MENA","The Taliban may be out of power, but the plight of Afghanistan's women goes on. There are trappings of new freedoms -- foremost among them a constitution that recognizes women's rights -- but in much of the countryside women and girls are still treated like chattel. As Carlotta Gall of The Times has described vividly, many young women find their lives so unbearable that they set themselves on fire to escape. Amid this despair, it's heartening to see individuals and groups finding innovative ways to help rebuild the lives of Afghan women, often one or two at a time. Parwaz, which means ''take flight'' in Dari, is one such effort. Directed by Katrin Fakiri, an enterprising Afghan-American who worked in Silicon Valley before 9/11, Parwaz has given loans of $100 or less to about 600 women who are trying to start very, very small businesses. That might mean buying a cart and fruit for the market or becoming a seamstress or turning the kitchen into a little bakery. Like other groups working to teach women to read, or those rebuilding health facilities demolished by the Taliban, Parwaz has had to make some concessions to Afghan realities. Male relatives co-sign loan applications, as a way of making the men feel invested in the women's businesses, instead of threatened by them. The interest rate is cleverly called an application fee -- spread over the term of the loan, of course -- to comply with the letter of Islamic law. There is also the awkward fact that some of these women are in the burka-sewing business. Mirroring microfinance's promising track record in other places, 98 percent of Parwaz's clients make their payments on time and in full. It is but one example of the current homegrown and international efforts to improve the lives of Afghan women. Far more are needed.",2004,"Afghanistan"
"173","U.N. Finds That 25% of Married Syrian Women Have Been Beaten","MENA","Syria's first comprehensive field study of violence against women has concluded that nearly one married woman in four surveyed had been beaten. The study was released last week as part of a report on Syria by the United Nations Development Fund for Women. The findings have been published in local news media, helping to draw attention to topics like domestic abuse and honor killings that have long been considered taboo in this conservative society. The study was carried out under the supervision of the quasi-governmental General Union of Women, which oversees the welfare of Syria's women. The study included nearly 1,900 families selected at random, including a broad range of income levels and all regions. The men and women in each family were questioned separately. ''In Syria there was simply no data on violence against women; formal studies hadn't ever been done before,'' said Shirin Shukri, a manager of the project at the United Nations regional office in Amman, Jordan. ''The issue of violence against women was kept silent here for many years. But we're making people in Syria aware that this is something that happens everywhere -- in Europe, in Asia, in the United States -- and this is opening up discussion.'' Hana Qaddoura, a spokeswoman for the General Union of Women, said that breaking the silence on domestic abuse was an essential first step to combating violence. Many Syrians, she said, do not believe that violence in the home ''counts'' as violence. ''There are some forms of violence against women that our society doesn't even see as violence,'' Ms. Qaddoura said. ''It all depends very much on education and income level, but many people see a woman who is beaten as being in a bad relationship; they don't see her as a victim of violence.'' The women's union said it would try to develop programs to protect women, in response to the study's findings. Advocates of women's rights here say that though the findings of the Syrian study are fairly similar to domestic abuse statistics in other countries, the fact that the official silence on the subject has been broken is in itself a meaningful step. ''The most surprising thing is that for the first time in Syria, a semigovernmental organization, the women's union, has admitted that there is a problem,'' said Maan Abdul Salam, a campaigner for women's rights. Bassam al-Kadi, a rights advocate, said the report was part of a growing openness about many forms of domestic abuse. He has been working on a public information campaign to curb the practice known as honor killings -- the killing of women who are believed to have dishonored their families by engaging in illicit sex. ''Until two years ago, discussion of honor killing was banned in the Syrian media,'' Mr. Kadi said. ''The incidents might be discussed individually, as 'accidents,' but talking about honor killing as a phenomenon was forbidden. Now these subjects are becoming much more open.'' Women's advocates say that though any attempt to broaden discussion of domestic violence is welcome, they have seen little effort by the government to address the topic in practical terms. Shelters for battered women are few and poorly publicized, and there are no formal channels for abused women to seek assistance. ''As it is now, there are still no mechanisms to report violence against women,'' Mr. Abdul Salam said. ''We hope that this study will soon lead to practical action on the ground.''",2006,"Syria"
"174","Women, Secret Hamas Strength, Win Votes at Polls and New Role","MENA","Hamas has been known and feared for its men, armed or strapped with suicide bombs. But in its parliamentary election triumph here last week, one secret weapon was its women. To a degree specialists said was new in the conservative Muslim society of the Gaza Strip, Hamas used its women to win, sending them door to door with voter lists and to polling places for last-minute campaigning. Now in surprise control of Palestinians politics, Hamas can boast that women hold 6 of the party's 74 seats in parliament -- giving the women of the radical group, guided in all ways by their understanding of Islam, a new and unaccustomed public role. ''We are going to lead factories, we are going to lead farmers,'' said Jamila al-Shanty, 48, a professor at the Islamic University here who won a seat in parliament. ''We are going to spread out through society. We are going to show the people of the world that the practice of Islam in regards to women is not well known.'' If Ms. Shanty's prediction is true, the role of women will certainly not be along the secular Western lines followed largely, and with real strides for women, under decades of leadership by Yasir Arafat's now defeated Fatah faction. The model will be Islam: women in Hamas wear head scarves and follow strict rules for social segregation from men. And one of their role models -- one of the few women in Hamas well known before the election -- has a pedigree particularly troubling to many in Israel and the outside world. She is Mariam Farhat, the mother of three Hamas supporters killed by Israelis. She bade one son goodbye in a homemade videotape before he stormed an Israeli settlement, killing five people, then being shot dead. She said later, in a much-publicized quotation, that she wished she had 100 sons to sacrifice that way. Known as the ''mother of martyrs,'' she was seen in a campaign video toting a gun. Now she is one of the six women who are Hamas legislators, elected on the party list. The election rules had quotas for women for all parties. She was swamped this week at a Hamas victory rally at the women's campus at the Islamic University by young, outspoken, educated women who see no contradiction between religious militancy and modernity. ''She is a mother to every house, every person,'' said one of the students, Reem el-Nabris, 20, who kissed and hugged Ms. Farhat. Ms. Farhat, 56, who had not been active in politics, said she hoped she deserved their praise as a role model. But she said her role should not be the only one for Hamas's women. ''It is not only sacrificing sons,'' she said after the rally. ''There are different kinds of sacrifice, by money, by education. Everybody, according to their ability, should sacrifice.'' The Islamic University, an oasis of order in the grit and chaos of Gaza, shows as well as any place the conflicting images of Hamas in relation to the women who strongly support it. A stronghold for Hamas, though not exclusively for its supporters, the university is split in two by sex, and it can be jarring to cross the corridor from crowds without a woman's face to another of only women, all with their heads covered, some wearing the full veil, the nikab. And on the day of the rally, some also plopped a green Hamas baseball cap on top. Yet Hamas encourages, and in some cases pays for, the education of these women. Sabrin al-Barawi, 21, a chemistry student, said she had grown up with Hamas programs for women: social groups, leadership courses, Koran classes. ''It's not only religious,'' said Ahlan Shameli, 21, who is studying computers. ''It's the Internet, computers.'' ''Before Hamas, women were not aware of the political situation,'' she said. ''But Hamas showed and clarified what was going on. Women have become much more aware.'' In nearly two decades, the top tier of Hamas's leadership has seemed very much reserved for men. But supporters of Hamas, as well as those of Fatah and other specialists, agreed with Ms. Shameli that Hamas had earned strong support among women. In fact, studies and results from municipal elections show women support the group in higher numbers than men. If the men's most visible role has been fighting Israel, Hamas's social programs have attracted the loyalty of women. Hamas offers assistance programs for widows of suicide bombers and for poor people, health clinics, day care, kindergartens and preschools, in addition to beauty parlors and women-only gyms. Women ''are the ones who take kids to clinics,'' said Mkhaimar Abusada, professor of political science at Al Azhar University here. ''They are the ones who take children to schools.'' And during the elections, he said, Hamas mobilized these same women as if it had been ''building up for this occasion for 30 years,'' using them as grass-roots campaign workers. ''It's something noticeable in the Gaza Strip,'' he said. ''In Palestinian society, our values do not accept women to go out and campaign in the street. It's really a new phenomenon, especially for Hamas.'' Reem Abu Athra, who directs women's affairs in the Fatah youth wing, said that her party did not seem to understand how mobilized Hamas's women were generally -- and that it did not match the grass-roots work by Hamas women during the elections. She said that Fatah seemed to think it would naturally win the women's vote, as the more secular party that has been in some ways a leader in the Arab world in rights for women. ''Fatah took women for granted, and this is one reason it lost,'' she said. The questions now seem to be what role Hamas's women will play, and exactly how that will be expressed in the rules of Islam. Naima Sheikh Ali, a Fatah legislator who runs a group for women here, said that Hamas's strict interpretation of Islam would remain a bar to true participation by women. They cannot, for instance, be judges under Islam, she said, and will generally remain segregated and pushed to the side. ''Yes, they respect women, but as they conceive that respect,'' she said. ''It is from a religiously fundamental view. For the women's movement, this will set us back several steps.'' Ms. Shanty, one of the new Hamas legislators, begged to differ. She said that women, and especially the wives of top Hamas leaders, had long played a central role in Hamas's leadership, though she said that had not been publicized to protect them. ''Every decision that is taken by Hamas is passed to us, not after the decision is made but before,'' she said. One measure of participation by women may be the extent that they take part in addressing the main problems facing Palestinians, not only on social issues that affect women, families or children. In an interview before she won a legislative seat, Mouna Mansour, 44, a physics teacher and widow of Jamal Mansour, an assassinated Hamas leader, seemed very much engaged in the central issues. The peace process with Israel, she said, was dead. There should be a Palestinian state, but not at the cost of Jerusalem or the claims of Palestinian refugees, who under previous negotiations would not be permitted to move into what is today Israel. Hamas, she said, needs to rebuild the economy, get rid of poverty and unemployment and, for now, to continue the cease-fire with Israel. But she also defended the decision of a young Nablus man to become a suicide bomber. ''Why not ask the question from another angle?'' she said. ''Why would he blow himself up if he was not subject to such great pressures?What leads you to do such a bitter thing? People do this from anger and injustice, to bring back life to their own people by sacrificing their lives.'' But there is also unease over what Hamas might mean for women. At least one Islamic University student said Hamas represented an unknown for women like her. The student, Rula Zaanin, 19, said that Hamas had, at least, earned her trust. ''A lot of Palestinians love Hamas and wanted them,'' she said. ''But we don't know what will happen.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2006,"Palestine"
"175","Challenging the Mullahs, One Signature at a Time","MENA","''Well-behaved women rarely make history,'' my favorite bumper sticker says. It surely applies to Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer and 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner whose relentless campaign against discrimination has enraged the mullahs for more than 25 years. In a country where the law values a woman's life at only half the price of a man's, Ms. Ebadi will not be quiet, and she is urging other women to find their voices. Her newest effort is to help collect the signatures of one million Iranian women on a petition protesting their lack of legal rights. The concept is simple and revolutionary, melding education, consciousness-raising and peaceful protest. Starting last year, women armed with petitions began to go to wherever other women gathered: schools, hair salons, doctors' offices and private homes. Every woman is asked to sign. But whatever a woman decides, she receives a leaflet explaining how Iran's interpretation of Islamic law denies women full rights. The material explains how Iran's divorce law makes it easy for men, and incredibly difficult for women, to leave a marriage, and how custody laws give divorced fathers sole rights to children above the age of 7. Ms. Ebadi says the petition drive has already trained ''400 young women to educate others'' about these injustices. The movement, made up of a network of women's organizations and publications, has no formal leadership, in part to lessen the chances of retaliation. That didn't help three female journalists who were arrested late last month after they wrote articles for feminist publications backing the drive. They have since been released but will face a hearing in two months. Ms. Ebadi will defend them. It's only natural to wonder how many more women will be arrested as they rebel, one signature at a time. And only natural to marvel about the courage of the 30,000 women who have already signed. The movement is doing on a grand scale what Ms. Ebadi has done for her entire adult life. When I last spoke with her, eight years ago in her Tehran home, she had emerged as a tenacious human rights campaigner after being forced to step down as a judge by the Islamic revolution. She was blunt about the lack of freedom in Iran and well aware of the price for such outspokenness. She's been arrested and imprisoned and the target of death threats. In New York in January for meetings at the United Nations, she was just as defiant and just as unafraid as I remembered. Winning the Nobel Prize has not given her immunity. There's a lot to speak out about. When Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is not propagating lies about the Holocaust or cheering on Iran's nuclear program, he's having independent journalists arrested. But he is not the only problem. Above him is the hard-line Council of Guardians and above it the supreme religious leader. The Council of Guardians vetoed legislation increasing civil liberties and banned most moderates from running for Parliament in 2004. Given the breadth of the institutional opposition arrayed against them, the Change for Equality Petition Drive is especially clever. Rather than directly confronting the system, it goes around it. Even women who don't sign the petition will be better informed about their second-class status. The hope is that they will then be less likely to accept injustice indefinitely. And if Iran's women start questioning their lack of rights, perhaps Iran's men will have the courage to speak out, too. The government certainly understands the implications. Just a few weeks ago, it blocked access to the campaign's Web site. But within hours the women had another Web site up and running. Ms. Ebadi, the lifelong agitator, does not mask her pride or her belief that women's voices will someday make all the difference. ''By getting one million signatures, the world will know we object to these conditions,'' she said. And I can't help but think that instead of one courageous woman for the government to contend with, it will have reaped a million.",2007,"Iran"

"177","Under a Scarf, a Turkish Lawyer Fighting to Wear It","MENA","FOR Fatma Benli, a Turkish lawyer and women's rights advocate, the controversy over Islamic head scarves has the irritating sound of a broken record. Ms. Benli, who is 34, wears one herself. (On Wednesday, it was light brown with a floral print, tucked into the neck of a white turtleneck.) But she would rather talk about other things. ''I could tell you about domestic violence, about honor killings, about the parts of the criminal code that discriminate against women,'' she said, ticking off her areas of expertise in rapid-fire sentences. ''But we can't move on to those issues. ''The head scarf is where we are stuck.'' The story of how Turkey got there is also, in large part, the story of Ms. Benli, who has been a central, if reluctant, participant in the fight in Turkey over whether covered women should be allowed to go to college. The governing party of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has taken their case to Parliament, trying to lift the ban at universities, a move that has enraged Turkey's secular establishment. A final vote on lifting the ban is scheduled for Saturday. Ms. Benli's family came to Istanbul from rural Turkey before she was born. They were part of a huge wave of migration to cities that began in the second part of the last century, as uneducated  religious Turks sought work in newly developing industries. In the process, Turkey changed into an urban society from an agrarian one, with more than 70 percent of the population living in cities today. By the 1990s, their children began to go to college. Still, the state remained divided by class, and the secular elite who controlled the state through institutions like the military and the judiciary watched warily as growing numbers of covered women, whose mothers had not been educated, entered campuses. Ms. Benli was the first person in her family to get a college education. She earned her law degree before the state began to enforce the ban in the late 1990s. But her two years of additional graduate work was stopped by the restriction, an interpretation of an earlier court ruling. A 300-page master's thesis at Istanbul University law school had to be orally defended on campus. Her mother, also covered, pressed her to remove her scarf, to no avail. ''I just couldn't do it,'' Ms. Benli said in an interview in her small law office this week. ''I left the room crying. They marked me absent.'' She says the reasons, deeply personal and hard to put into words, are a combination of her relationship to God and her aversion to accepting what she sees as misplaced authority. ''This is related to my private life,'' she said. ''It's my personality. My wholeness.'' In one particularly traumatic example, as told to Ms. Benli by several of her clients, a university rector forced several women to uncover their heads in front of him, in order to obtain his signature to allow them to transfer out of the college he was taking over and no longer allowing them to attend. The state, she said, was saying, ''No matter what you think, I can make you do what I want,'' an attitude which, if obeyed, made one feel ''degraded.'' MS. BENLI contends passionately that the ban moves Turkish society backward by keeping women like herself out of skilled professions. The women in her generation of the family include a doctor, a dentist and a teacher, but their daughters have fewer opportunities. ''There's a sense of defeat,'' she said. ''Now, the objective is to have a family, to make a nice marriage. They do not have the ideals we once had.'' For the past decade she has been defending cases of covered women who argue that the state has violated their legal rights. She has medical students who cannot get their diplomas, a housewife who is not allowed to take driving lessons, a woman whose husband, a civil servant, takes another woman, uncovered, to official ceremonies as his wife. Because of her scarf, which is also banned in public buildings, Ms. Benli cannot defend the cases in the courts, and so has to send uncovered partners to do so for her. Last month, one of her law partners took up the veil, and now they are both looking for new partners. ''They say you are not a person,'' she said last Saturday at a women's center in Istanbul. ''We can limit you because you don't deserve it. They don't cite laws. They say you are a threat.'' Life is hard enough in Turkey as a woman, Ms. Benli argues, but being covered brings an additional discrimination, even from other women. Once, several years ago, she said, she prepared a research report on domestic violence in Turkey. She wanted it to be circulated widely, and so shared it with another women's group. The response was positive. ''They said, 'This is very good,' '' she said. But when she met the group's members face to face, she could feel the women draw back. '' 'Oh, you're a head scarf woman,' '' she said, recalling their response. ''They didn't invite us back.'' That kind of attitude leaves a mark on women, she said. Covering is frowned upon in secular society as backward and old-fashioned. She knows women, now covered, who try to avoid passing by former college campuses, where they were required to be uncovered. Memories can have an unpleasant taste. TURKISH society is consumed with discussions about the head scarf. Talk shows blare loud debates. Newspapers declare victories and defeats in headlines. That has led to a lot of talk, some of it deeply uninformed, about whether Islam requires the veil. Ms. Benli said she did not want people untrained in religion to decide for her. ''This is like a foot doctor making a diagnosis on the teeth,'' she said, smiling. The ban has caused bursts of ingenuity by the women and the state they are trying to circumvent. To obtain identification cards with photographs of uncovered heads, young women have used computer graphics programs to draw hair over their scarves. But Turkey's Higher Education Council, responsible for enforcing the ban, has countered by sending its own photographers to campuses and requiring women to have their pictures taken by them. To elude the ban, some women began attending college in northern Cyprus, which Turkey controls, but Turkish authorities followed, according to Ms. Benli, setting up rules that forbid Turkish citizens to wear their scarves in schools there. Yet other Muslims, from Europe and Africa, are free to wear them. Turkey has even asked Bulgaria to require Turks to uncover in college, Ms. Benli said. ''They called religious people uncontemporary,'' she said. ''Now they are applying very uncontemporary methods.'' Meanwhile, the fight over the scarf goes on. A mainstream secular newspaper ran an article  about Ms. Benli and a group of activists demonstrating in a public area, saying they were subversives and religious radicals. The photograph, however, told a different tale. She was in the center, she said, flanked by other women, some covered, some not. ''I was in pink,'' she said, smiling playfully, ''and I was very beautiful.''",2008,"Turkey"
"178","Move to Lift a Ban on Head Scarves Gains in Turkey","MENA","Parliament took a major step on Saturday toward lifting a ban against women's head scarves at universities, setting the stage for a final showdown with Turkey's  secular elite over where Islam fits in the building of an open society. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of a measure supported by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to change the  Constitution in a way they say will guarantee all citizens the right to go to college regardless of how they dress. The  authorities imposed the ban in the late 1990s, arguing that the growing number of covered women in colleges threatened secularism, one of the founding principles of modern Turkey. Secular opposition lawmakers voted against the change, with about a fifth of all ballots cast. Crowds of secular Turks backed them on the streets of the capital, Ankara, chanting that secularism -- and women's right to resist being forced to wear head scarves by an increasingly conservative society -- was under threat. ''This decision will bring further pressure on women,'' said Nesrin Baytok, a member of Parliament from the opposition secular party, during the debate in Parliament. ''It will ultimately bring us Hezbollah terror, Al Qaeda terror and fundamentalism.'' Another member from that party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said the group would take the amendments to the  Constitutional Court, a pro-secular institution that is likely to rule against Mr. Erdogan. That process must wait until the changes are approved by the president and published in the official state newspaper. The head scarf ban, and the push to repeal it by Mr. Erdogan's governing party, has become one of the most emotional issues in Turkey. It pits a rising, increasingly wealthy middle class of observant Turks, on one side, against a secular elite, backed by the military and the judiciary, on the other. ''It's all about power,'' said Jenny B. White, an anthropologist  at Boston University who has been studying  Turkey since the 1970s. ''It's about who gets to decide what Turkey's image and emblematic lifestyle will be. Islam is the lightning rod for all the fears and concerns.'' Many secular Turks are concerned that  the  Justice and Development Party led by Mr. Erdogan  has such significant power, controlling  Parliament, the presidency and the prime ministry, that it will impose its own conservative values  on Turkey. ''It's been presented as a liberty to cover the head, but in practice, it is going to evolve into a ban on uncovered hair,'' said Hikmet Sami Turk, a former justice minister, speaking on NTV television. Turkey's current tensions are rooted in its recent past, when migrants from the country's more observant heartland moved to cities, starting in the 1950s, in a process that changed Turkey into an urban society. But it remained divided by class, and when many covered women began entering universities and taking public sector jobs, the secular elite banned head scarves. Now, Mr. Erdogan is trying to lift the ban, and the debate, which began in Parliament on Wednesday, has been emotional. ''I will entrust liver to a cat, but won't entrust secularism to you,''  Deniz Baykal, the head of the secular opposition party, said Wednesday, according to Today's Zaman, an English-language daily newspaper. Cemil Cicek, a conservative member of Mr. Erdogan's party, countered, ''We are not trying to bring a ban; we are trying to lift a ban.'' ''Why aren't you willing to reach consensus, but spread radioactive fear and horror across the country like the Chernobyl power station?'' he asked in Wednesday's debate. ''What is this?'' Turkey is groping toward a new understanding of itself. Observant Turks, the underclass for years, are now firmly part of the elite, and hard questions have emerged about how to share public space, like  college campuses and public buildings. Those who argue for retaining the ban say they do not oppose the head scarf worn in times past by grandmothers, tied babushka-style under the chin. Nilufer Gole, a Turkish sociologist who wrote ''The Forbidden Modern: Civilization and Veiling,'' argues that the past generation was mostly working class, and therefore not threatening, while today's wealthier covered women are. ''We liked our grandmothers because they were just knitting,'' she said by telephone from Paris. ''They were never trying to go to university.'' Turkey's booming economy is a great equalizer. On the streets of Istanbul, young women in jeans, stylish T-shirts and Keds wear head scarves of all colors. Young observant women are more integrated than ever. ''For me it's a good sign,'' Ms. Gole said. ''It means they are participating.'' Still, Turkey is entering uncharted waters in its attempts to balance liberal democracy, Islam and secularism, and Western models do not show the way. ''It's not like a Sikh policeman wearing a turban under his helmet in England,'' said Murat Belge, a professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. In Britain, Sikhs are a tiny minority. In Turkey, he said, those asking to have their way  are a majority. That majority, many secularists believe, is using the veil as a first step toward a repressive Islamic state. But Ms. White, writing in a Turkish newspaper on Friday, said the veil's political meaning is in the eye of the beholder.  ''Meaning,'' she wrote, ''is in our heads, not on our heads.''",2008,"Turkey"
"179","Saudi Arabia's Promised Reforms","MENA","King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia did the right thing when he pardoned the ''Qatif girl.'' The perfect injustice of the case, in which a young woman was gang raped and then sentenced to 200 lashes for being alone in a car with a man to whom she was not married, left him no choice. Now another ugly face of Saudi justice has been revealed, one that cannot be explained by religion, ancient tradition or culture. The detention last month of an outspoken blogger, Fouad al-Farhan -- only confirmed by the Interior Ministry this week -- is an act of thoroughly modern despotism and one the king should immediately overrule. Mr. Farhan's Web site, www.alfarhan.org, has posted a letter from him in which he said he was being investigated because of his writings about political prisoners. If King Abdullah is really serious about reforming his kingdom's legal system, as he has indicated that he is, then he must change not only the Sharia-based courts but also the organs of state security that silence critics in his name. King Abdullah's announced reforms include the creation of a Supreme Court as well as specialized courts for criminal, commercial, labor and family matters, and the training of legal staff. These plans have been especially welcomed by foreigners doing business in Saudi Arabia, who have been hamstrung by the capriciousness of the religious judges. The case of the woman from the Eastern town of Qatif should make clear to the king that his reforms cannot stop at making life easier for businessmen. They must also make life far better for women, who are denied basic legal and social rights, and they must give more legal protection to those who criticize the government. Defenders of the existing Saudi system argue that change in this traditional society must come slowly. Many Saudis are clearly eager for more and faster change. A Gallup poll conducted last year showed that a majority want more freedoms for women. King Abdullah has demonstrated a laudable desire for reform. He must understand that cruelty, sex discrimination and censorship cannot be part of a modern legal system or a country that wants to participate in the modern world. When President Bush visits Saudi Arabia this month, he should remind the king of that.",2008,"Saudi Arabia"
"180","Starting at Home, Iran's Women Fight for Rights","MENA","In a year of marriage, Razieh Qassemi, 19, says she was beaten repeatedly by her husband and his father. Her husband, she says, is addicted to methamphetamine and has threatened to marry another woman to ''torture'' her. Rather than endure the abuse, Ms. Qassemi took a step that might never have occurred to an earlier generation of Iranian women: she filed for divorce. Women's rights advocates say Iranian women are displaying a growing determination to achieve equal status in this conservative Muslim theocracy, where male supremacy is still enscribed in the legal code. One in five marriages now end in divorce, according to government data, a fourfold increase in the past 15 years. And it is not just women from the wealthy, Westernized elites. The family court building in Vanak Square here is filled with women, like Ms. Qassemi, who are not privileged. Women from lower classes and even the religious are among those marching up and down the stairs to fight for divorces and custody of their children. Increasing educational levels and the information revolution have contributed to creating a generation of women determined to gain more control over their lives, rights advocates say. Confronted with new cultural and legal restrictions after the Islamic Revolution in 1979, some young women turned to higher education as a way to get away from home, postpone marriage and earn social respect, advocates say. Religious women, who had refused to sit in classes with men, returned to universities after they were resegregated. Today, more than 60 percent of university students are women, compared with just over 30 percent in 1982, even though classes are no longer segregated. Even for those women for whom college is not an option, the Internet and satellite television have opened windows into the lives of women in the West. ''Satellite has shown an alternative way of being,'' said Syma Sayah, a feminist involved in social work in Tehran. ''Women see that it is possible to be treated equally with men.'' Another sign of changing attitudes is the increasing popularity of books, movies and documentaries that explore sex discrimination, rights advocates say. ''Women do not have a proper status in society,'' said Mahnaz Mohammadi, a filmmaker. ''Films are supposed to be a mirror of reality, and we make films to change the status quo.'' In a recent movie, ''All Women Are Angels,'' a comedy that was at the top of the box office for weeks, a judge rejects the divorce plea of a woman who walked out on her husband when she found him with another woman. Even men are taking up women's issues and are critical of traditional marriage arrangements. Mehrdad Oskouei, another  filmmaker, has won more than a dozen international awards for ''The Other Side of Burka,'' a documentary about women on the impoverished and traditional southern island of Qeshm who are committing suicide in increasing numbers because they have no other way out of their marriages. ''How can divorce help a woman in southern parts of the country when she has to return after divorce to her father's home who will make her even more miserable than her husband?'' said Fatimeh Sadeghi, a former political science professor fired for her writing on women's rights. Janet Afary, a professor of Middle East and women's studies at Purdue University and the author of ''Sexual Politics in Modern Iran,'' says the country is moving inexorably toward a ''sexual revolution.'' ''The laws have denied women many basic rights in marriage and divorce,'' she wrote in the book. ''But they have also contributed to numerous state initiatives promoting literacy, health and infrastructural improvements that benefited the urban and rural poor.'' To separate the sexes, the state built schools and universities expressly for women, and improved basic transportation, enabling poor women to travel more easily to big cities, where they were exposed to more modern ideas. Ms. Afary says that mandatory premarital programs to teach about sex and birth control, instituted in 1993 to control population growth, helped women delay pregnancy and changed their views toward marriage. By the late 1990s, she says, young people were looking for psychological and social compatibility and mutual intimacy in marriage. Despite the gains they have made, women still face extraordinary obstacles. Girls can legally be forced into marriage at the age of 13. Men have the right to divorce their wives whenever they wish, and are granted custody of any children over the age of 7. Men can ban their wives from working outside the home, and can engage in polygamy. By law, women may inherit from their parents only half the shares of their brothers. Their court testimony is worth half that of a man. Although the state has taken steps to discourage stoning, it remains in the penal code as the punishment for women who commit adultery. A woman who refuses to cover her hair faces jail and up to 80 lashes. Women also face fierce resistance when they  organize to change the law. The Campaign for One Million Signatures was founded in 2005, inspired by a movement in Morocco  that led to a loosening of misogynist laws. The idea was to collect one million signatures for a petition calling on authorities to give women more equal footing in the laws on marriage, divorce, adultery and polygamy. But Iran's government has come down hard on the group, charging many of its founders with trying to overthrow  it; 47 members have been jailed so far, including 3 who were arrested late last month. Many still face charges, and six members are forbidden to leave the country. One member, Alieh Eghdamdoust, began a three-year jail sentence last month for participating in a women's demonstration in 2006. The group's Web site, www.we-change.org, has been blocked by the authorities 18 times. ''We feel we achieved a great deal even though we are faced with security charges,'' said Sussan Tahmasebi, one of the founding members of the campaign, who is now forbidden to leave  Iran. ''No one is accusing us of talking against Islam. No one is afraid to talk about more rights for women anymore. This is a big achievement.'' Women's advocates say that the differences between religious and secular women have narrowed and that both now chafe at the legal discrimination against women. Zahra Eshraghi, for example, the granddaughter of the revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, signed the One Million Signatures petition. ''Many of these religious women changed throughout the years,'' said Ms. Sayah, the feminist in Tehran. ''They became educated, they traveled abroad and attended conferences on women's rights, and they learned.'' Because of the government's campaign of suppression, the process of collecting signatures has slowed recently, and many women do not want to be seen in the presence of a campaigner, let alone sign a petition. Most feminist groups limit their canvassing now to the Internet. But while the million signatures campaign may have stalled, women have scored some notable successes. A group that calls itself Meydaan has earned international recognition for pressing the government to stop  stonings. The group's reporting on  executions by stoning in 2002 on its Web site, www.meydaan.net -- including a video of the execution of a prostitute  -- embarrassed the government and led the head of the judiciary to issue a motion urging judges to refrain from ordering stonings. (The stonings have continued anyway, but at a lower rate, because only Parliament has the power to ban them.)",2009,"Iran"
"181","A Promise of Reform in Saudi Arabia","MENA","Saudi Arabia is notoriously change-averse, but four years after assuming the crown, King Abdullah may finally be ready to fulfill his promise to lead his country toward greater tolerance and modernity. We welcome his decision to name several reformers to top posts in his government -- and his even more surprising decision to oust certain hard-line leaders of the country's powerful religious establishment. We hope it means that Saudi Arabia will soon grant full civil and legal rights to women and all who reside in the kingdom. Most of the attention has centered on the king's appointment of the first female deputy minister, who will focus on women's education. That is an important first step. But there is still a very long way to go before women have anything approaching equality. Saudi women need permission from their husbands or fathers to work, travel, study or even receive health care. They cannot drive. While more than half of the university students are women, their job prospects are severely limited. The ordeal of the ''Qatif girl'' is a horrifying reminder of the insecurity and injustice of women's lives in Saudi Arabia. In 2006,  the young woman was gang-raped and later was nearly victimized again when the religious-dominated justice system sentenced her to 200 lashes for being alone in a car with a man to whom she was not married. She was only spared after King Abdullah heeded international protests and pardoned her. Last week, King Abdullah challenged the conservative establishment even more directly, firing the chief of the widely feared religious police and the leader of the kingdom's highest tribunal, the Supreme Council of Justice. The ousted chief justice issued a ruling last September saying that it would be permissible to kill the owners of TV channels broadcasting ''immorality.'' Moderates also were added to the Grand Ulema Commission, an influential body of religious scholars from all branches of Sunni Islam. Regrettably, the king stopped short of adding minority Shiites to the mix. Since the 9/11 attacks -- 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudis -- Saudi Arabia has pledged to reform a hard-line religious-based education system that is seen as encouraging extremism. And Saudi officials say that the king's new education minister, Prince Faisal bin Abdullah, is a committed reformer. He also is the king's son-in-law, so there can be no more excuses if Saudi textbooks continue to spew hateful views of non-Muslims. King Abdullah has demonstrated a laudable desire for change, but he must make even bolder changes to meet the needs of his people and to set an example of moderation and tolerance for the rest of the Arab world. For that, he will have to carve out more space for political debate and citizen participation and create modern political institutions. That is the only way to ensure his reforms will continue no matter who is advising the king in years to come -- or who is king.",2009,"Saudi Arabia"

The law is intended to regulate family life inside Afghanistan's Shiite population, which makes up about 20 percent of the total Afghan population. It does not affect Sunni Muslims.

''The Western media have either mistranslated or taken incorrect information and then published it,'' Mr. Karzai said at a news briefing in the presidential palace on Saturday. ''If there is anything in contradiction with our Constitution or Shariah, or freedoms granted by the Constitution, we will take action in close consultation with the clerics of the country.'' If changes are needed, he said, the bill would be sent back to Parliament. Human rights officials have criticized the law, in particular for the restrictions it places on when a woman can leave her house, and for stating the circumstances in which she has to have sex with her husband. A Shiite woman would be allowed to leave home only ''for a legitimate purpose,'' which the law does not define. The law also says, ''Unless the wife is ill, the wife is bound to give a positive response to the sexual desires of her husband.'' Critics have said that provision legalizes marital rape. The law also outlines rules on divorce, child custody and marriage, all in ways that discriminate against women, said Soraya Sobhrang, commissioner for women's rights at the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. While the law applies only to Shiites, who represent approximately 10 percent of the population, its passage could influence a proposed family law for the Sunni majority and a draft law on violence against women, Ms. Sobhrang said. ''This opens the way for more discrimination,'' she said. Mr. Karzai signed the law last week after a vote in Parliament last month, Ms. Sobhrang said, adding that she had seen a copy of the law with his signature. However, the presidential spokesman, Homayun Hamidzada, would not confirm that the president had signed the law and said only that the he was still reviewing it. Mr. Karzai's decision to review the law came after a storm of criticism in recent days. Canada called in the Afghan ambassador for an explanation, and NATO's secretary general questioned why the alliance was sending men and women to fight in Afghanistan when discrimination against women was condoned by law. Asked about the law at a news conference in Strasbourg, France, on Saturday, President Obama called it ''abhorrent.'' ''We think that it is very important for us to be sensitive to local culture,'' he said, ''but we also think that there are certain basic principles that all nations should uphold, and respect for women and respect for their freedom and integrity is an important principle.'' Also on Saturday, Italy's defense minister said Italy was considering a temporary withdrawal of the women serving in its force in Afghanistan to protest the law, Reuters reported. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, said the law represented a ''huge step in the wrong direction.'' ''For a new law in 2009 to target women in this way is extraordinary, reprehensible and reminiscent of the decrees made by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in the 1990s,'' Ms. Pillay said in a statement posted on her agency's Web site. ''This is another clear indication that the human rights situation in Afghanistan is getting worse, not better.'' In addition to the clauses on when women may leave the home and must submit to their husbands, Ms. Pillay said she was concerned about a section that forbids women from working or receiving education without their husband's permission. Ms. Sobhrang, who has been working on the issue for the last two years, said women's groups and the human rights commissions had worked with Parliament to introduce amendments but then the law was suddenly pushed through with only three amendments. The bill as originally drawn up by Shiite clerics barred a woman from leaving the house without her husband's permission, she said. The parliamentary judicial commission amended that provision to say that a woman could leave the house ''for a legitimate purpose.'' Mr. Karzai cited that provision in a news conference on Saturday, pointing out that the final version of the law did not ban a woman from leaving her house. But Ms. Sobhrang said even as amended the law contravened the Constitution, which recognizes equal rights for men and women. The term ''for a legitimate purpose'' was open to interpretation, she added. She said Mr. Karzai had supported women's rights in the past but seemed to have given that up in recent months. Some Western officials have speculated that he signed the law to win the support of conservative Shiite clerics in coming presidential elections. Yet the leading cleric behind the Family Law, Sheik Muhammad Asif Mohseni, complained last week that he was dissatisfied with the amendments that Parliament had made to his original draft. Speaking on his own television channel, Tamadun Television, he objected to the introduction of a legal age for marriage, ''16 for women and 18 for men,'' saying that people should be able to decide for themselves. Human rights officials consider raising the marriage age a critical step toward ending the common practice of forced marriages and the marriage of young girls. Another amendment gave women longer custody of young children in the case of divorce. In the original draft, women could have custody of a son until he was 2 years old, and a daughter until she was 7. The amended version raises the ages to 7 for boys and 9 for girls. Ms. Sobhrang criticized both versions for not taking into account the interests and desires of the children.",2009,"Afghanistan"
"184","Afghan Women Defy Convention, and Crowds, to Protest New Law on Home Life","MENA","The young women stepped off the bus and moved toward the protest march just beginning on the other side of the street when they were spotted by a mob of men. ''Get out of here, you whores!'' the men shouted. ''Get out!'' The women scattered as the men moved in. ''We want our rights!'' one of the women shouted, turning to face them. ''We want equality!'' The women ran to the bus and dived inside as it rumbled away, with the men smashing the taillights and banging on the sides. ''Whores!'' But the march continued anyway. About 300 Afghan women, facing an angry throng three times larger than their own, walked the streets of the capital on Wednesday to demand that Parliament repeal a new law that introduces a range of Taliban-like restrictions on women, and permits, among other things, marital rape. It was an extraordinary scene. Women are mostly illiterate in this impoverished country, and they do not, generally speaking, enjoy anything near the freedom accorded to men. But there they were, most of them young, many in jeans, defying a threatening crowd and calling out slogans heavy with meaning. With the Afghan police keeping the mob at bay, the women walked two miles to Parliament, where they delivered a petition calling for the law's repeal. ''Whenever a man wants sex, we cannot refuse,'' said Fatima Husseini, 26, one of the marchers. ''It means a woman is a kind of property, to be used by the man in any way that he wants.'' The law, approved by both houses of Parliament and signed by President Hamid Karzai, applies to the Shiite minority only. Women here and governments and rights groups abroad have protested three parts of the law especially. One provision makes it illegal for a woman to resist her husband's sexual advances. A second provision requires a husband's permission for a woman to work outside the home or go to school. And a third makes it illegal for a woman to refuse to ''make herself up'' or ''dress up'' if that is what her husband wants. The passage of the law has amounted to something of a historical irony. Afghan Shiites, who make up close to 20 percent of the population, suffered horrendously under the Taliban, who regarded them as apostates. Since 2001, the Shiites, particularly the Hazara minority, have been enjoying a renaissance. President Karzai, who relies on vast support from the United States and other Western governments to stay in power, has come under intense international criticism for signing the bill into law. Many people here suspect that he did so to gain the favor of the Shiite clergy; Mr. Karzai is up for re-election this year. Previous Afghan governments, during the Soviet era and before the arrival of the Taliban, did not impose such restrictive laws, although in practice many rural women's freedoms have long been curtailed. Rights advocates say the law for Shiites could influence a proposal for Sunnis and a draft law on violence against women. Responding to the outcry, Mr. Karzai has begun looking for a way to remove the most controversial parts of the law. In an interview on Wednesday, his spokesman, Homayun Hamidzada, said that the legislation was not yet law because it had not been published in the government's official register. That, Mr. Hamidzada said, means that it can still be changed. Mr. Karzai has asked his justice minister to look it over. ''We have no doubt that whatever comes out of this process will be consistent with the rights provided for in the Constitution -- equality and the protection of women,'' Mr. Hamidzada said. The women who protested Wednesday began their demonstration with what appeared to be a deliberately provocative act. They gathered in front of the School of the Last Prophet, a madrasa run by Ayatollah Asif Mohseni,  the country's most powerful Shiite cleric. He and the scholars around him played an important role in drafting the new law. ''We are here to campaign for our rights,'' one woman said into a megaphone. Then the women held their banners aloft and began to chant. The reaction was immediate. Hundreds of students from the madrasa, most but not all of them men, poured into the streets to confront the demonstrators. ''Death to the enemies of Islam!'' the counterdemonstrators cried, encircling the women. ''We want Islamic law!'' The women stared ahead and marched. A phalanx of police officers, some of them women, held the crowds apart. Afterward, when the demonstrators had left, one of the madrasa's senior clerics came outside. Asked about the dispute, he said it was between professionals and nonprofessionals; that is, between the clerics, who understood the Koran and Islamic law, and the women calling for the law's repeal who did not. ''It's like if you are sick, you go to a doctor, not some amateur,'' said the cleric, Mohammed Hussein Jafaari. ''This law was approved by the scholars. It was passed by both houses of Parliament. It was signed by the president.'' The religious scholars, Mr. Jafaari conceded, were all men. Lingering a while, Mr. Jafaari said that what was really driving the dispute was the foreigners who loomed so large over the country. ''We Afghans don't want a bunch of NATO commanders and foreign ministers telling us what to do.''",2009,"Afghanistan"
"185","Iranians Protest Bill On Rights Of Women","MENA","In what appeared to be the first burst of activism in months not related to the disputed presidential election, about 1,200 Iranians signed a statement against a bill that would further curb women's rights, the feminist Web site Change for Gender Equality reported. The statement, issued Wednesday, calls for other groups to protest the bill, which would give  men the right to take  additional wives without having to tell the current  wives under certain conditions and would impose restrictions on alimony for women. The bill was approved last month by Parliament's legal committee. In Iran, men can have several wives, but they are generally supposed to get permission from their current ones. ''We issued the statement because we are worried that various groups, including women, can lose civil rights under tense political times like now,'' said Asieh Amini, a lawyer and women's rights advocate living in Oslo. ''We have no doubt that democracy will not be implemented without taking women's rights into consideration.'' Women have played a major role in the protests since the election in June, which the opposition claims the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stole. Many women have been jailed and at least several were killed in the government crackdown on street protests that followed the vote. Women's rights in Iran have been curtailed since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, but in recent years, women have been displaying an increasing determination to achieve equal status in this conservative Muslim theocracy. Women are forced to cover their hair and they have consistently been subjected to intimidation in public over what they wear. A group of advocates for women, including Ms. Amini and the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, met with members of the legal committee of Parliament in late 2008 to try to persuade them not to pass the bill. Some advocates thought until last month that they had won the battle, but now they fear conservatives may be using political unrest to push for new restrictions on women. Articles in the new bill allow a man to marry a new  wife without the permission of a current one if she is absent for more than six months, including time served in prison, or has an incurable disease. The bill would also subject a woman's alimony to a reassessment, although it is vague on what that means. Alimony would, however, be taxed. Also on Wednesday, an appeals court increased the punishment for Ghader Mohammadzadeh, a Kurdish activist, to death instead of 23 years in prison, a human rights Web site, Reporters and Human Rights Activists News Agency, reported. This is the second time an appeals court has increased the punishment from a prison term to death in recent months, and it appears to be part of a larger crackdown on dissent. Another court sentenced Amir Reza Arefi, 21, to death on Monday on charges of waging war against God, the Web site reported. He was accused of being linked to royalist groups in exile. Reporters and Human Rights Activists News Agency also reported Wednesday that Mahdieh Golroo, a student activist arrested in September, was in severe condition at the notorious Evin prison, where she was said to be have an intestinal infection.",2010,"Iran"
"186","Women's Rights in Mideast","MENA","To the Editor: Maureen Dowd's column describing the ''enlightened'' trends in Saudi Arabia regarding women's rights may reflect truly remarkable Saudi moves toward ''chipping away at gender apartheid'' (''Loosey Goosey Saudi,'' March 3). Nevertheless, Saudi society cannot be compared to the dynamic, liberal Israeli society. Israeli women have long played leadership roles at all levels of society, including as prime minister. An active women's rights movement and an independent court system provide for protection of human rights and continued progress. Israeli society is engaged in a continuing evolution, blending the best of modernity and ancient tradition.

"187","Law and Custom Press Afghan Women's Shelters","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- After her parents threw her out of the house for refusing to marry a 52-year-old widower with five children, Sabra, 18, boarded a bus that dropped her, afraid and confused, in downtown Kabul. She slept in a mosque for days, barely eating, until a woman took pity on her and put her in touch with human rights workers, who escorted her to a women's shelter. That journey -- terrifying enough for a young woman who had never ventured beyond the corner bazaar -- would become harder still under new rules being drafted by the Afghan government that women's advocates say will deter the most vulnerable women and girls from seeking refuge and are placing shelters under siege. The new rules speak to the suspicions that women's shelters still generate in this deeply conservative society, where the shelters have come to symbolize the competition between modern values and traditional Afghan ways. Many believe their very existence at best encourages girls to run away from home and at worst are fronts for brothels. The changes in the law would require a woman like Sabra to justify her flight to an eight-member government panel, which would determine whether she needed to be in a shelter or should be sent to jail or back home, where she would be at risk of a beating or even death. She would also have to undergo a physical exam that could include a virginity test. While some are hopeful that the government may soften the provisions before final approval, women's advocates see the effort as an example of government pandering to religious and social conservatives as President Hamid Karzai's administration starts reconciliation efforts with insurgents. Women's rights, they fear, will be the first area in which the government makes compromises. ''I'm not sure why they are doing it -- maybe because the government is becoming more conservative and to appease the Taliban they are doing things like this,'' said Manizha Naderi, the director of Women for Afghan Women, which runs three shelters and five family counseling centers around the country. ''Domestic violence is cultural and it takes time to change and it will change, but women need a safe place when they are a victim of violence,'' she said. A decade ago, shelters for abused women did not even exist in Afghanistan, where even now many of the worst practices associated with the Taliban era, like arranged marriages for child brides, public flogging and mutilation of women, continue in rural areas. Today, about 14 women's shelters exist, financed by a mix of international organizations, private donors and Western governments. The new rules, drafted by the Women's Affairs Ministry, would place those shelters under direct government control. The rules have alarmed women's advocates, who say they fear a government-appointed panel will not be able to stand up to pressure from power brokers or others who may want their daughters sent home so that they can be punished in accord with Afghan customs. Even fleeing an abusive marriage is seen as bringing shame on a woman's family. ''Many times, I have faced difficulties from the governor or district governor who are supporting the family of the girl, not the girl,'' said Soraya Pakzad, who runs shelters in Herat and Badghis Provinces. ''If her father is an ex-commander and the judge is a friend and they say, 'You have to send the girl home,' we are able to raise our voices, but I am afraid that courage will not be found in the Department of Women's Affairs.'' The shelter directors say they are willing to be subject to close government monitoring and are ready to adhere to government-required operating procedures. Running the shelters, however, is not something that the Women's Affairs Ministry has the budget, the staff or expertise to take on, according to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and shelter directors. ''The ministry cannot find staff for its offices in some of the provinces, so how will they find staff for the more sensitive job of running shelters?'' said Soraya Sobhrang, a member of the human rights commission who focuses on women's issues. The Women's Affairs Ministry has had a hard time recruiting women to work in its provincial offices in the Pashtun south and east of the country, where the insurgency remains strong. Local directors routinely face threats and assassination attempts. The evolution of the new rules began in 2009 when Mr. Karzai set up a commission led by a senior religious figure, Mullah Nematullah Shahrani, to look into the shelters and prepare a report. Senior officials at the Women's Affairs Ministry insist that the new rules are for the good of the women and that they have no intention of taking over existing shelters. A copy of the draft rules obtained by The New York Times makes clear, however, that nongovernmental organizations would no longer run shelters. ''We want to have centers where women can feel safe and free of tension and seek help,'' said Fawzia Amini, the chief of legal affairs for the ministry, who was involved in drafting the rules. ''We don't want to assert control on the shelters or safe houses being run by the N.G.O.'s or other individual,'' she said, adding, ''We want to have our own shelters besides the shelters.'' The Afghan cabinet, however, appears to have given a clear order that all shelters should be run by the government, people who are close to the administration say. This may perhaps reflect the widespread sensitivity to the shelters by many in Mr. Karzai's government and in Parliament, who particularly resent that they remind the public of how far Afghanistan has to go in combating violence against women. A case in point is the minister of labor, social affairs, martyrs and the disabled, Amina Afzali, a member of the commission that visited the country's shelters. In an interview, she agreed that there were cases where women needed protection, but was upset about the shelters' high profile in discussing abuse. Particularly grating, Ms. Afzali said, was the publicity over Bibi Aisha, a child bride whose nose was hacked off by her husband after she tried to run away from his home. She was photographed by Time magazine, which put her on its cover last year, while she was staying at a shelter run by Women for Afghan Women. Such publicity ''humiliates us in the eyes of the world,'' Ms. Afzali said. ''Now Afghanistan is under a microscope, but if other countries were scrutinized the way Afghanistan has been, they too would have such exceptional cases as this one.'' Some conservative members of Parliament would like to have the shelters closed altogether. Hajji Neyaz Mohammed, a lawmaker from Ghazni Province, bluntly condemned shelters as ''the official places for increasing perversion in our country.'' ''These shelters create problems in families and homes, and they motivate girls to flee from their houses,'' he said. In 90 percent of cases when girls return from the shelters to their villages, they will not be accepted by the community and will be suspected of having committed adultery, he said.",2011,"Afghanistan"
"188","Afghan Women's Shelters","MENA","To the Editor: Afghan women's shelters are a crucial refuge for women escaping brutal violence -- and these shelters are under siege. Proposed legal changes would place shelters under government authority and make a woman's access contingent on discriminatory social mores, including virginity and marital status. Today, an Afghan woman facing violence can turn -- with no questions asked -- to one of the few shelters run by women's organizations. If this proposal passes, she will not even have that option. These sanctuaries exist now because of the brave efforts of women's rights activists. The state panel that seeks to regulate women's access to shelters is part of a government riddled with women's human rights abusers.

"189","Women Fight to Maintain Their Role in the Building of a New Egypt","MENA","CAIRO -- When the prime minister of Egypt stepped down on Thursday, Shereen Diaa, 32, was cooking lunch for her two young sons in a suburb on Cairo's outskirts. A veiled woman who molds her life around her children, Ms. Diaa had promised herself she would stop attending political protests and focus on her boys, ages 6 and 8. But when she saw on Facebook that the new prime minister himself would address the protesters the next day, in an unprecedented act, she could not resist. ''I will leave you only two hours,'' she said she told the children, dropping them off with her mother and then heading downtown to Tahrir Square. In the raucous crowd, she stepped on a water jug to catch a glimpse of the prime minister, Essam Sharaf, who had stood with the demonstrators before Hosni Mubarak was ousted as president. ''I see him! I am really happy!'' she exclaimed, beaming, one voice among thousands. ''Raise your head high, you are Egyptian!'' they chanted. Egypt's popular revolution was the work of men and women, bringing together housewives and fruit sellers, businesswomen and students. At its height, roughly one quarter of the million protesters who poured into the square each day were women. Veiled and unveiled women shouted, fought and slept in the streets alongside men, upending traditional expectations of their behavior. The challenge now, activists here say, is to make sure that women maintain their involvement as the nation lurches forward, so that their contribution to the revolution is not forgotten. ''Things have not changed, they are changing,'' said Mozn Hassan, 32, the executive director of the organization Nazra for Feminist Studies. She barely returned home during the 18 days it took to topple Mr. Mubarak, but that is not enough, she said. ''Revolution is not about 18 days in Tahrir Square and then turning it into a carnival and loving the army,'' she said. ''We have simply won the first phase.'' It is an indication of the place of women here that Ms. Hassan was referring to the need for political gains and true equality, rather than some more basic rights denied to women in parts of the Arab world. Even as this country has become more devout, experts say roughly 25 percent of Egyptian women work outside their homes. And they are allowed to mix more freely in public with men than in some other Arab countries. But a recent report by the World Economic Forum ranked Egypt 125th out of 134 countries when judging the equality between men and women, in good part because so many women do not work, 42 percent of women cannot read or write and almost no women are political leaders. (In 2010, only 8 of the 454 seats in Parliament were held by women.) Genital cutting of women is still widely practiced in Egypt, especially in rural areas. Women here also suffer a level of sexual harassment that would not be tolerated in many countries. They are often verbally harassed on the street in Cairo and sometimes groped in crowded spaces whether they are veiled or not, leading many wealthier women to simply abandon walking downtown. Egypt is a step ahead of other popular uprisings in the region, which have had similar bursts of female participation, accompanied by a recognition from men that their support is vital. In Bahrain, hundreds of women wrapped in traditional black tunics stood up to the authorities in the demonstrations against the government, but in a nod to their conservative culture, they slept and prayed outside during protests in a roped-off women's section. In Yemen, only in the past few days have significant numbers of women started to protest in Sana, the capital, but their numbers were dwarfed by the crowds of men. Ms. Diaa, whose husband works for a multinational corporation, said the role of housewives in Egypt's revolution has been critical because they often have more time to protest than their husbands. The importance of wives has long been clear to the Muslim Brotherhood; women are active in the charitable groups that form the organization's backbone. ''We feel this is our country now,'' said Abrar Mousad, 15, a Brotherhood supporter who stood in the square with her mother, aunt and cousin. They had come from the northern city of Tanta to take part. ''Everything has changed. I can say what I think and what I need without any fear from anyone.'' That assessment may be overly optimistic; feminists acknowledge that the battle for equality will not be easy. Still, women here are energized, and say perhaps the greatest change so far has been internal. They came to be convinced that the traffic-choked streets of downtown Cairo, long a male-dominated space, could be equally theirs despite years of rampant sexual harassment. A study in 2008 by the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights found that a vast majority of the women surveyed had been harassed. And the harassers, who are often members of the state security forces, are almost never punished, said Nehad Abu El Komsan, the director of the organization. Ms. Komsan placed blame for the problem on the lack of laws protecting women against sexual violence, women's fear of reporting trouble, and a powerful undercurrent of oppression and frustration in Egyptian society, particularly among the millions of poor, uneducated and unemployed young men. But during the revolution, women faced snipers and tear gas on those same streets, and they interacted with men they had been told to avoid. ''The same men they were afraid to talk to in the streets were saying, 'Bravo, the girls' revolution,' '' Ms. Hassan said. It did not take long, however, before the sense of unity that had grown in Tahrir Square was interrupted. On Feb. 11, just as Mr. Mubarak fell, the crowd suddenly swelled, crushing people against one another. It was shortly afterward that Lara Logan, a CBS News reporter, was sexually assaulted; the details of the attack remain unclear. Several Egyptian women also reported being groped and harassed. Ms. Komsan and other women said they believed that the violence, which had been absent during the revolution itself, was the work of outsiders or young men who treated the night as they would a victorious soccer match, which are notorious for harassment. But it was still a reminder of how far Egypt has to go to address one of its most disturbing social problems. ''I was so disappointed,'' said Yasmeen Mekawy, 25, an Egyptian-American who had been surprised that she faced no harassment during the revolution, but who was grabbed from behind the Friday after Mr. Mubarak was driven from power. There have been disappointments outside the square, too. The committee of eight legal experts appointed by the military authorities to revise the Constitution did not include a single woman or, according to Amal abd al-Hadi, a longtime feminist here, anyone with a gender-sensitive perspective. As a result, one proposed revision states that the Egyptian president may not be married to a ''non-Egyptian woman'' -- seemingly ruling out the possibility of a woman as president. A coalition of 63 women's groups started a petition to include a female lawyer on the committee, arguing that women ''have the right to participate in building the new Egyptian state.'' Ms. Hadi noted that in past Egyptian revolutions, in 1919 and 1952, women's contributions had been met with similar setbacks. One of the feminists' worst fears is that expected revisions in the country's laws will erode the rights they do have, especially if conservative Islamic forces play a greater role in government. But many women also note progress. On Friday, some of the many young women in Tahrir Square wore unofficial police headbands and held up signs reminding men to respect women. Outside the square, the deep suspicion that had separated secular feminists from Islamic feminists, who believe Islam should be the paradigm for women's rights, is being bridged, said Fatma Eman, 28, an Islamic feminist who is a co-founder of Nazra. ''After the revolution, I was welcomed in a very decent way,'' she said. ''They needed something to prove that we were allies.'' A coalition including Nawal el-Saadawi, a leading feminist, is planning a million women's march for Tuesday, with no set agenda other than to promote democracy. Ms. Diaa said that she planned to stay home now to give the new prime minister a chance to work and to help her children. But she said she would return to the streets if Mr. Sharaf did not quickly make democratic changes. ''I don't see a difference between men and women,'' she said, talking about her many days of protesting. ''The only difference is that men are more able to take the sticks of the thugs. But that doesn't mean we don't have a voice. I believe that I have a voice, so I can't stay at home. I have a responsibility. I can be one of a million.''",2011,"Egypt"

To the contrary, in many ways sex discrimination in Yemen is sanctioned both by law and in practice. The Personal Status Law calls for wife obedience, allows marital rape, reinforces stereotypes about women's roles as caretakers within the home and severely restricts women's freedom of movement. The recent remarks made by President Ali Abdullah Saleh condemning women's participation in public protests as being un-Islamic reflects the secondary status given to Yemeni women. The Yemeni government must not only repeal all discriminatory provisions in its law, but also take steps to end discrimination by enacting laws that will protect women and girls, like setting a minimum age for marriage and supporting women's equal participation in public life.

"192","In Turkey, Fears of a Retreat on Women's Rights","MENA","ISTANBUL -- Gokce, a soft-spoken 37-year-old mother of two, has lived on the run for 15 years, ever since her abusive husband tracked her down, broke down her door and shot her in the leg six times after she refused to return to him. Stoic and prematurely graying, she said her husband had since kidnapped her mother and stabbed her brother, trying to force them to reveal her whereabouts. She repeatedly turned to the police. But, she said, they chided her to return to her husband. Once, after her husband came to pick her up at the police station, she said she heard an officer advise him to break her legs so she could not escape. ''Our state is the No. 1 enemy of women,'' Gokce said recently at a women's shelter here in Istanbul, declining to use her last name for fear of her husband. ''I was 14 when my husband started to abuse me, and now I'm 37, and I am still living in fear for my life despite all my cries for help.'' While reliable statistics are hard to come by, given what Turkish experts say is the serious underreporting of domestic violence here, rights groups point to a recent spate of high-profile attacks against women to raise the alarm that Turkey is backsliding on women's rights. They say women's progress is being undermined by Turkey's flagging prospects for European Union membership and a Muslim-inspired government that is increasingly embracing the conservative values of the Arab world it seeks to lead. So bleak is the situation that this year one outreach group suggested that the state should simply arm women and provide shooting lessons. Fears that the governing party is diminishing women were fanned this month when President Abdullah Gul approved a controversial bill that extended compulsory education to 12 years but allowed home-schooling after the first eight, which critics said could encourage the practice of taking child brides. The government rejected such criticism, saying the changes brought Turkey in line with international education standards. The culture wars over women's role in Turkish society also reflect tensions in a majority Muslim country where the state's official secularism is clashing with an ascendant class of religious conservatives. With their rise, rights groups say, men appear to be increasingly acting with impunity against women. Last year there were 207,253 cases of deliberate injuries to women across the country, compared with 189,377 in 2010, according to official data collected by the National Police Headquarters in the capital, Ankara, and provided to Vildan Yirmibesoglu, the general secretary of Kader, a leading rights group. A United Nations report published last July indicated that the incidence of domestic violence against women in Turkey topped the percentages in the United States and Europe. The report -- based on data from a 2009 Turkish government study in which 12,785 women were interviewed across 12 regions -- said 39 percent of women in Turkey had suffered physical violence at some time in their lives, compared with 22 percent in the United States and between 3 and 35 percent in 20 European countries. In February 2011, Turkey's justice minister shocked the country when, in response to a parliamentary question, he said that there had been a staggering increase in the murders of women, from 66 in 2002, to 953 in the first seven months of 2009. But while the change is large, the numbers are still relatively low for a country of 80 million, possibly skewed by underreporting. After the governing Justice and Development Party of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power in 2002, determined for Turkey to join the European Union, women's rights were a priority. Laws that discriminated against women were removed. Others were added: rape within marriage was criminalized, and life sentences became possible for perpetrators of so-called honor killings. But analysts say women are now losing ground. While the governing party insists that it is simply socially conservative and pro-family, Nigar Goksel, a senior analyst at the European Stability Initiative who wrote a major study on women in Turkey, argued that rising domestic violence and women's low participation in the work force (at 28 percent, less than half the European Union average) reflected that family integrity was valued over a woman's individual rights. ''The government started off as an unlikely feminist but has dropped the ball,'' Ms. Goksel said. ''Equally, the Arab Spring is pulling Turkey in a more conservative direction.'' Mr. Erdogan, a pious Muslim, attracted the ire of many feminists here when during last year's election campaign he called on women to have at least three children and argued that birth control advocates sought to weaken Turkey. With subsidized child care rare, many women protested that he was pushing them back into the kitchen. Ayse Bohurler, a founding and leading member of Justice and Development, said that the education of women had improved under the government, which she said was also taking a strong stand against domestic violence. Others argued that claims of a sexist society smacked of hyperbole, given that women in Turkey hold prominent positions in business and politics, and that the country has even had a female prime minister. In March the Turkish Parliament passed a variety of legislation friendly to women, including a law forcing husbands deemed abusive by the courts to wear electronic monitoring devices and allowing the police to issue protection orders if a family court or prosecutor is unavailable. The police are also to receive training on women's rights. But legislation, however well intentioned, may not be enough to change mentalities in an abidingly patriarchal nation, or to ensure that new laws will be fully implemented. For instance, every municipality here with more than 50,000 people is required by law to have at least one women's shelter. But the current count nationwide is just 79, a number that is woefully low for a nation that size, rights groups say. One local official in Ankara recently told a conservative women's group that opening more was ill advised since they enabled women to leave home, according to a member of the group. But finding protection is proving elusive. In one murder case last year, a woman named Arzu Yildirim was shot eight times by her partner in the middle of a busy Istanbul street, even though, women's rights groups said, she had filed for legal protection more than 10 times. A copy of her most recent letter of complaint was found in her blood-stained purse. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",2012,"Turkey"
"193","Saudi Arabia: Help Wanted","MENA","  The government said it would begin this week to enforce a law that allows only women to work in women's lingerie and apparel stores. The 2006 law barring men from working in women's apparel and cosmetic stores has never been put into effect, partly because religious hard-liners oppose the whole idea of women's working where men and women congregate, like malls. Saudi women, tired of having to deal with men when buying undergarments, have boycotted lingerie stores to pressure them to employ women. Thousands of men will lose their sales jobs, but the Labor Ministry says that more than 28,000 women, many of them South Asian migrants, have applied to replace them.",2012,"Saudi Arabia"
"194","Saudi Women Shatter the Lingerie Ceiling","MENA","A scholar at the Middle East Institute and the author of ''Saudi Arabia on the Edge: The Uncertain Future of an American Ally.''  A SOCIAL revolution began in Saudi Arabia this month, and it has little if anything to do with the Arab Spring. Women are going to work in lingerie shops. The Ministry of Labor is enforcing a royal decree issued last summer ordering that sales personnel in shops selling garments and other goods, like cosmetics, that are only for women must be female. More than 28,000 women applied for the jobs, the ministry said. Anywhere else in the world, it would not be news that sales assistants in shops selling panties and bras were female. In Saudi Arabia, where women have always been excluded from the public work force, it is a critical breakthrough. This is not just about intimate garments; this is a milestone on the arduous path to employment equality for women in a country where they are systematically excluded from retail activity. Saudi Arabia's economic planners recognize that if women are going to be educated at public expense, as they now are in increasing numbers, they will expect to work and the country will need their economic output. Society has increasingly accepted the idea that women will work outside the home. They have long been employed in medicine and education. Retail commerce, however, has generally remained closed because such work usually requires interaction with men, which is prohibited. The lingerie shops are breaking that taboo. One of the oddest sights in Saudi Arabia is that of fully veiled women, hidden from others by their enveloping garments, going into the Saudi equivalent of Victoria's Secret stores in the many upscale malls and being greeted and assisted exclusively by male sales clerks, most of whom are from South Asia. This absurd situation so embarrassed many women that they waited until they were out of the country to buy their underwear and nightgowns. The campaign to change the rules began several years ago, and was led by Reem Asaad, a fashion-conscious financial adviser who speaks flawless English and is comfortable with the Western media. It appeared to have succeeded in 2006 when the government ordered that the sales jobs be transferred to women. But social conservatives and the religious establishment objected, arguing that Islam prohibited women from working outside the home and that putting women in retail shops would expose them to the view of any passing stranger. If the sales clerks were female, the shop windows would have to be covered, the opponents said. Shop owners objected, too, saying that no women were trained to do such work. In addition, the 2006 decree failed to address the transportation problem: if women were going to work in those shops, they would need a man to drive them because they are prohibited from driving. Saudi cities have virtually no public transportation. So the decree was never enforced. Ms. Asaad then used Facebook to organize a boycott of the shops, and arranged for some women to be trained in retail work. This time, King Abdullah has put his personal authority behind the new decree. Last year he also installed a new minister of labor, Adel Fakieh, who had embraced the idea of employing women at a supermarket chain owned by his holding company. Under the new rules, the country's thousands of lingerie and cosmetics shops have until June to replace their male employees with women. The feared religious police, who are really the behavior police, have been ordered to cooperate. King Abdullah generally supported an expansion of opportunities for women, but steps in this direction can't be traced to any burst of enlightenment within the royal family. They are happening because the kingdom's women need and want jobs and are learning how to make themselves heard -- and because, in an increasingly expensive country, their husbands often want them to work. Over the coming generation, this is likely to be the farthest-reaching transformation in Saudi society. While women are still constrained by law, religion and custom, more and more are likely to enter the work force. They will be better educated than their predecessors, will marry later and will have fewer children. The range of jobs and professions open to them will expand. The Ministry of Labor is already compiling a list of jobs women will be permitted to hold. It won't include all jobs -- no female miners or construction workers here -- but it will be a much longer list than in the past, including some positions in law enforcement. These changes will meet entrenched opposition, but the economic and demographic forces behind them seem irresistible. The transition would be easier if women were permitted to drive (the 2011 decree failed to address that issue), but that is bound to come, too -- if not this year, then soon, if only because growing ranks of employed women will build pressure for it. Thousands of Saudi women have driver's licenses issued by other countries; they will be ready when the day comes.",2012,"Saudi Arabia"
"195","Egypt's Women Find Power Still Hinges on Men","MENA","CAIRO -- At first Samira Ibrahim was afraid to tell her father that Egyptian soldiers had detained her in Tahrir Square in Cairo, stripped off her clothes, and watched as she was forcibly subjected to a ''virginity test.'' But when her father, a religious conservative, saw electric prod marks on her body, they revived memories of his own detention and torture under President Hosni Mubarak's government. ''History is repeating itself,'' he told her, and together they vowed to file a court case against the military rulers, to claim ''my rights,'' as Ms. Ibrahim later recalled. That case has proved successful so far. For the first time last month, an administrative court challenged the authority of the military council and banned such ''tests.'' Ms. Ibrahim will ask a military court on Sunday to hold the officers accountable. But nearly a year after Mr. Mubarak's ouster, Ms. Ibrahim's story in many ways illustrates the paradoxical position of women in the new Egypt. Emboldened by the revolution to claim a new voice in public life, many are finding that they are still dependent on the protection of men, and that their greatest power is not as direct actors but as symbols of the military government's repression. It is not a place where Egyptian feminists had hoped women would be, back in the heady days of the revolution, when they played an active role, side by side with men, to bring down a dictator. ''Changing the patriarchal culture is not so easy,'' said Mozn Hassan, 32, executive director of the seven-year-old group Nazra for Feminist Studies. Female demonstrators have suffered sexual assaults at the hands of Egyptian soldiers protected by military courts. Human rights groups say they have documented the cases of at least 100 women who were sexually assaulted by soldiers or the security police during the time of military rule -- including Ms. Ibrahim's experience in March and the anonymous woman recorded on video last month as she was beaten and stripped, exposing a blue bra, by soldiers clearing Tahrir Square after fresh protests. The vast majority of cases have come during the three-month crackdown on demonstrations that has taken more than 80 lives since the beginning of October. Even when women have pushed back, as they did late last month in a historic march by thousands through downtown Cairo -- many carrying pictures of the ''blue bra girl'' -- they have done so only with the protection of men. Men encircled the marchers and at times those male guardians seemed to direct the crowd or lead its chants; many chants led by women called for more ''gallantry'' from Egyptian men. Famous mainly as silent victims, women like the ''blue bra girl'' risk becoming mascots of the male-dominated uprising, said Ms. Hassan, one of several Egyptian feminists who said they were thrilled by the size of the march -- but winced at its dependence on men. ''If you are calling for men to protect you, that is bad, because then they define you and they stick to the traditional roles,'' Ms. Hassan said. (Even among feminist groups, there were few all-women organizations in Egypt, and of the 13 founders of Ms. Hassan's organization, 6 were men.) At the same time, the revolution has opened the door for the ascendance of conservative Islamist parties, including religious extremists who want to roll back some of the rights women do have. The mainstream Muslim Brotherhood is poised to win nearly half of the seats in Parliament, when voting is completed this week, while the more extreme Salafis are on track to win more than 20 percent. While Brotherhood leaders talk of encouraging traditional roles but respecting women's career choices, many Salafis oppose allowing women to play leadership roles and favor regulating issues like women's dress to impose Islamic standards of modesty. ''We have major concerns because what they are proposing is very oppressive,'' said Ghada Shabandar, a veteran human rights activist. Even now, however, women have almost no leadership roles in the various activists groups that formed out of the original protests that ousted Mr. Mubarak and so far women have fewer than 10 of the roughly 500 seats in Parliament. The electoral debates have featured scant mention of women's issues -- from the pervasiveness of genital cutting to legally sanctioned employment discrimination, despite official statistics showing that a third of Egyptian households depend on female earners. ''We have no feminist movement now,'' said Hala Mustafa, editor of Democracy, a state-run journal. Feminists say that for decades Egyptian security forces have kidnapped or sexually abused women as a way to pressure the men in their families. In a celebrated case from 2005, a journalist, Nawal Ali, sought to press charges against the government-aligned thugs who had beaten and stripped her in an attack. It is not all bleak, though. Some argue that the revolution is helping to revitalize the dormant women's movement, if only by opening up politics so Ms. Ibrahim could have her day in court or thousands could march for the woman stripped to her bra. ''That is the difference the Egyptian revolution has made,'' Ms. Shabandar said. ''The wall of fear is gone, and now when we march for the 'blue bra girl,' we march for Nawal Ali.'' A few younger feminists, though, say that philosophy keeps women in the back seat. ''That is the same thing women were told after the revolution,'' said Masa Amir, 24, recalling when the military council picked an all-male panel of jurists to draft a temporary constitution. But the result was a document implying that the president could only be a man -- perhaps because no one at the table raised the issue. But the stigma attached to victims of sexual abuse continues to force many to remain silent. Six other women were subjected to ''virginity tests'' by the soldiers that night in March when Ms. Ibrahim was assaulted. The humiliation was so great, Ms. Ibrahim said, that she initially hoped to die. ''I kept telling myself, 'People get heart attacks, why don't I get a heart attack and just die like them?' '' Her mother's advice was to keep silent, if she ever hoped to marry, or even lead a dignified life in their village in rural Upper Egypt, Ms. Ibrahim said in an interview. When she did speak out, Egyptian new media shunned her, she said, and only the international news media would cover her story. She received telephone calls at all hours threatening rape or death. But with the support of her father -- an Islamist activist who was detained and tortured two decades ago -- she persevered, and next week will go back to military court in an attempt to hold the perpetrators accountable as well. When she saw the video of the ''blue bra girl'' being beaten, it redoubled her resolve. ''I felt I had to avenge her,'' she said.",2012,"Egypt"

Though the examples cited are serious, they are peripheral to the lives of the vast majority of Israeli women, who enjoy full and equal rights unrivaled anywhere in the Middle East -- indeed, in most of the world. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly and categorically condemned any discrimination against women. ''In the State of Israel, in which women sit in the cockpit, women can sit in any place,'' he recently told a graduating class of air force pilots that included five women. Any threat to women's rights in Israel will be resisted by Israel's leaders, among them the three government ministers, 24 members of Parliament, the heads of Israel's two main opposition parties, a general on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the chief justice of the Supreme Court, all of whom are women.

"197","Applause for a Saudi Advance","MENA","DUBAI -- For the first time in Saudi Arabia's history, women have been appointed to the Shura Council, the traditionally all-male body which drafts laws, debates major issues and provides advice to the king. It may seem a modest step. There are still no female ministers in the cabinet and women will remain segregated within the council, with their own seating area and a separate door. The unelected council has only an advisory role: It proposes laws but the king wields sole legislative power. Yet the chosen women, and some others, are calling the appointments a major advance. ''This enormous, rapid and noteworthy progress means Saudi society and its governing body are finally ready to acknowledge and respect women's voices and their rights,'' said Dr. Khawla Al-Kuraya, a professor of pathology, and director at the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer and Research. Dr. Kuraya is one of the 30 women -- drawn from the elite ranks of Saudi society and including two royal princesses -- named by King Abdullah last week to join the 150-member council, which meets in the capital, Riyadh. The king's decree, which stipulated that from now on women should make up 20 percent of the council, came amid contradictory signals on women's rights in the kingdom. Women are still forbidden to drive and, since November, new electronic texting procedures have been introduced to tighten the compulsory monitoring by their male guardians of women traveling outside the kingdom. Still, women's advocates, including some men, are hopeful that the opening of the Shura Council could lead to other advances. ''This is a major move to introduce more reforms when it comes to gender equality throughout our daily lives,'' said Khalid Al Khudair, founder of Glowork.net, a recruitment Web site for women in Saudi Arabia. ''Their presence as advisers to the king will move new laws in the right direction, with labor laws suited to allow women to work in new sectors and industries.'' ''This could mean we will see women driving very soon,'' Mr. Khudair added. The change on the council follows several economic measures aimed at increasing female participation in the work force. Since August last year, the Labor Ministry has progressively opened up jobs for women in the retail industry, notably by ordering the replacement of male assistants in stores selling lingerie, abayas and jewelry. Mounira Jamjoom, a research specialist at the Booz consulting firm in Riyadh, said: ''The decision to integrate women in the political process is timely, and by providing policy stability, the government can unleash the region's considerable human promise -- its increasingly educated and aspiring women.'' As recently as 2011 women were excluded from voting in municipal elections -- the highest, if occasional, forum for democracy in a kingdom that has no elected national institutions. But the king has promised that they will be allowed to vote and run for office in the next municipals, planned for 2015. ''Saudi Arabia is the most conservative Gulf country when it comes to women's rights, so the appointment of women to the Shura Council, while in the short term its impact is symbolic, in the long term its impact is significant,'' said Najla Al Awadhi, a former member of the United Arab Emirates Parliament and one of the first female members of the legislature there. ''This step by the Saudi king begins to chip away at the institutional and psychological barriers in Saudi society that have historically been unaccepting of a woman's role in public life where national issues are debated and shaped,'' she added. ''So the presence of Saudi women there is critical.'' Appointing women to the Shura Council also will create role models for younger women in a society where women have been expected to stay out of the limelight. ''We are going to be partners in building our country and that is a phenomenal change from just 10 years ago,'' said Muna AbuSulayman, a Saudi development consultant who was formerly a popular television talk show host and secretary general of the Alwaleed Bin Talal Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Kingdom Holding. ''It is a great step in realizing that female rights are really human rights.'' Women will be able to join any of the committees of the council including economic, family and foreign affairs. ''Contrary to popular belief, I don't believe that specific female-related issues are going to be the main focus of the women of the Shura,'' said Dr. Kuraya. ''Rather, as members we have the right to raise and address the diverse array of issues that concern Saudi society as a whole.''",2013,"Saudi Arabia"
"198","Saudi Arabia: King Allows Women To Join a Royal Advisory Body","MENA","Women are not allowed to drive and cannot yet vote in Saudi Arabia, but on Friday they were given a voice in an advisory council that debates the kingdom's legislation. The Saudi king, Abdullah, issued a decree that for the first time gave women seats on the Shura council, an assembly whose members are appointed to discuss laws and other issues and advise the king, but that has no legislative power. The decree, published by the official Saudi Press Agency, gave women 30 of the 150 seats on the council with all the duties of their male counterparts. In line with a strict interpretation of Islam that segregates the population by sex in many areas of society, it added that women would wear hijab, a conservative Islamic head covering, and would use doors, offices and seating areas separate from the men. The decision was met with a mixture of optimism that the country was inching forward with reforms and skepticism from activists who are pushing for greater freedom for women in the conservative kingdom, one of the world's few remaining absolute monarchies. Some used social media to express their disdain for the gesture, saying the women were joining a powerless assembly and creating a hashtag phrase on Twitter in Arabic that said, ''The new Shura council does not represent me.'' The number of Shiites on the council, a minority, rose to six members from five. A women's rights activist from Saudi Arabia, Manal al-Sharif, who has started a campaign for women's driving rights, wrote on Twitter: ''The amendments ignored Saudis' demands of electing the members and increasing the council powers! It still cannot pass or enforce laws.'' Iyad Madani, a former minister, said the inclusion of women was worth ''celebrating'' as ''a confirmation of her participation in the political process.'' Two of the women appointed are princesses. Another is Thuraya Obaid, who was appointed in 2000 by Kofi Annan, then the United Nations secretary general, as a director of the United Nations Development Program. In a decree in 2011, King Abdullah granted women the right to vote and run in municipal elections scheduled for 2015, the biggest change in a decade for women in the puritanical kingdom. He also promised to name women to the Shura council at that time. But Saudi women still cannot make ordinary decisions, like marrying or traveling abroad, without written permission from a legal male guardian, ''effectively treating her as a minor all her life,'' Ms. Sharif wrote in a separate statement on the Web site of the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights. Women also continued to be arrested for driving. In one case in 2011, a woman was sentenced to 10 lashes for violating the ban. The king later revoked the sentence.

"199","Women Face Fight to Keep Their Rights in New Tunisia","MENA","TUNIS -- At the funeral this month of Chokri Belaid, the murdered secular opposition leader in Tunisia, his widow Basma Khalfaoui, a prominent feminist, stood on the ambulance carrying his casket, her head uncovered, raising her arm to wave a defiant victory sign. ''My husband was denouncing Ennahda's double talk and we will continue his struggle,'' Ms. Khalfaoui, 42, said at the funeral, referring to the moderate Islamist party that governs the country. ''We will not give up the fight.'' Tunisia, perceived by the West as the most secular country in the Arab world and a staunch promoter of women's rights, has gone through a rocky transition since the revolution two years ago that ousted President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. While political pluralism exists for the first time in decades, new freedoms for some are threatening long-cherished ones for others -- in particular those for Tunisian women. After Tunisia gained its independence from France in 1956, the government passed laws to expand women's rights, including the right to education and gender equality. Over the following decades, Islamists were persecuted and exiled while the government pushed the secularization of society to such an extent that a decree in 1981 banned women from wearing a veil in public buildings and universities. After the fall of Mr. Ben Ali's regime, the Ennahda party won elections in October 2011 with a comfortable majority. Since then, worries have grown that one of its aims is to restrict women's freedoms in a country where, until recently, those rights had been taken for granted for decades. ''I think it's normal that the Islamists are so vocal -- veiled women used to be harassed and the frustration came out all at once,'' said Sarah Ben Hamadi, 28, a blogger and journalist. ''We are simply paying today for Ben Ali's mistakes.'' ''I don't think the country is more radical,'' she added. ''There is more freedom so we see more of the religious people who were hiding in the past.'' Certainly, the religious ultraconservatives known as Salafists are more visible. The University of Manouba, in suburban Tunis, experienced months of tension last year after Salafist students rioted against the ban on the niqab, the face-covering veil. More worrying are legal overhauls, human rights officials say. As Tunisia's Constituent Assembly writes a new constitution, there have been repeated confrontations between Islamists, who dominate the assembly and want to roll back some rights acquired by women, and secular liberals, who want an expansion of those rights to include, for example, equal inheritance rights. ''We cannot speak of an obvious rollback since the legal reality is still the same,'' said Amna Guellali, the director of Human Rights Watch in Tunis. ''But acquired rights are being threatened by repeated attacks by Salafist groups on those they consider infidels or on behavior they deem contrary to Islamic morality.'' When a young woman was allegedly raped by police officers in September, she was charged with indecency and risked six months in prison before the charges were dropped, after a huge uproar. Human rights organizations cite the case as an example of how rights are under threat. ''Under the old regime, there were similar cases,'' Ms. Guellali acknowledged. ''Now with the new freedoms in the country, the media is paying attention to these kinds of stories.'' Still, she said, even allowing for the amplifying effect of the news coverage, something has changed. Chema Gargouri, the president of the Tunisian Association for Management and Social Stability, a nongovernmental organization that provides training and microloans for women and young people in poor areas, said women were more secure under Mr. Ben Ali. ''What was really striking to me after the revolution was that women started to lose their self-esteem,'' Ms. Gargouri said. ''The dictatorship was pro-woman. The hatred against the dictatorship is expressed through action against women.'' The rise of social and religious repression and the loss of self-confidence ''prevents any entrepreneurial initiative for women,'' she added. Ms. Gargouri, who is in her 40s, said that women of her generation had never previously had to debate or defend their rights. But recent developments had pushed her to work to raise awareness of the challenge now facing them. ''What scares me is that the Tunisian woman seems lost,'' she said. ''In many places I go to, people ask what the government can do for them. We try to teach them to do it on their own.'' The fact is that Tunisia has an Islamist majority, said Ms. Ben Hamadi, the blogger. ''Article 1 of the Tunisian Constitution states that it is an Islamic state,'' she said. ''If we want real democracy, we must listen to everyone's voice.''",2013,"Tunisia"
"200","Muslim Brotherhood's Statement on Women Stirs Liberals' Fears","MENA","CAIRO -- During its decades as an underground Islamist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood has long preached that Islam required women to obey their husbands in all matters. ''A woman needs to be confined within a framework that is controlled by the man of the house,'' Osama Yehia Abu Salama, a Brotherhood family expert, said of the group's general approach, speaking in a recent seminar for women training to become marriage counselors. Even if a wife were beaten by her husband, he advised, ''Show her how she had a role in what happened to her.'' ''If he is to blame,'' Mr. Abu Salama added, ''she shares 30 percent or 40 percent of the fault.'' Now, with a leader of the Brotherhood's political arm in Egypt's presidential palace and its members dominating Parliament, some deeply patriarchal views the organization has long taught its members are spilling into public view. The Brotherhood's strident statements are reinforcing fears among many Egyptian liberals about the potential consequences of the group's rise to power and creating new awkwardness for President Mohamed Morsi as he presents himself as a new kind of moderate, Western-friendly Islamist. In a statement Wednesday on a proposed United Nations declaration to condemn violence against women, the Brotherhood issued a list of objections, which formally laid out its views on women for the first time since it came to power. In its statement, the Brotherhood said that wives should not have the right to file legal complaints against their husbands for rape, and husbands should not be subject to the punishments meted out for the rape of a stranger. A husband must have ''guardianship'' over his wife, not an equal ''partnership'' with her, the group declared. Daughters should not have the same inheritance rights as sons. Nor should the law cancel ''the need for a husband's consent in matters like travel, work or use of contraception'' -- a reform in traditional Islamic family law that was enacted under former President Hosni Mubarak and credited to his wife, Suzanne. The statement appeared in many ways to reflect the Brotherhood's longstanding doctrine, still discussed in classes like Mr. Abu Salama's and in the group's women's forums. Feminists said its statement also may reflect the views of most women in Egypt's conservative, traditionalist culture. In an interview on Thursday, Pakinam El-Sharkawy, President Morsi's political adviser and Egypt's representative last week at the United Nations commission, sought to distance the Morsi administration from the Brotherhood's statement. The Brotherhood, she emphasized, does not speak for the president; he has resigned from the Brotherhood but remains a member of its political party. ''Does any statement issued by any political party or group represent the presidency?'' she asked. ''It's not the presidency's institution, and it's not an official entity.'' The Egyptian government, she said, ''is working with all its powers and policies to stop all forms of violence against women.'' The government objected to the United Nations declaration condemning violence against women, she said, only over issues like whether to describe restrictions on abortion as an act of violence against women. That offended the cultural norms in many Arab and African countries, she said. Asked about the statement's apparent attempt to shield marital rape from legal prosecution, Ms. Sharkawy brushed off the issue as an irrelevant foreign concern. ''Marital rape? Is this a big problem that we have?'' she said, suggesting that it might be a Western phenomenon, while sexual harassment in the streets was a far greater concern in Egypt. ''Should we import their concerns and problems and adopt them as ours?'' she asked. ''We're talking about things that aren't widely agreed upon, like abortion. We can't give women the freedom to have abortions whenever they want.'' Do not pick issues not pressing in Egypt, she said, ''and then tell me that I'm in a conflict with the international community.'' Some Egyptian feminists, though, called the statement a vindication of their warnings that the Brotherhood might lead Egypt in a more conservative and patriarchal direction. ''They do not believe that when domestic violence is present, the women should resort to the justice system or the legal process,'' said Ghada Shahbandar of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights. ''It should be kept at home and under the protection of the family -- that is their claim. And there is no such thing as marital rape because a husband is entitled to have sex with his wife any time that he wants.'' ''This is the first time we have heard it said publicly on the world stage,'' she said, ''but this has been in their rhetoric for ages.'' In his seminar for prospective Islamist marriage counselors, Mr. Abu Salama justified the group's approach to marriage by explaining that Islam also required husbands to be compassionate, just as it required women to be obedient. Quoting Muhammad's injunction that a man ''must not fall on his wife like an animal,'' a textbook in Mr. Abu Salama's class said Islam instructed men to engage in foreplay before sex and attend to their partner's satisfaction. As for inheritance, Islamic scholars have argued that a son should have a greater share, but also an obligation to look after the financial well-being of a sister. But Mr. Abu Salam also argued that husbands should keep their wives under tight control. ''It's the nature of the weak to overstep the required framework if she is given the space and the freedom, like children,'' he said in the seminar. Most of the women nodded in agreement. Closing its statement on the proposed United Nations declaration, the Brotherhood appeared to go even further.

Ms. Asaad, a financial adviser and mother of three girls who lives in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, had started a Facebook group in 2008 calling for stores to hire women because it was embarrassing and inconvenient to interact with male clerks about underwear. It wasn't intended as a full campaign, but others encouraged her to continue. ""I had no plan, but I just kept going,"" Ms. Asaad said during a recent visit to The Times to discuss her new project, a book about her experiences and those of other Saudi women that she is writing with the New York-based author Rahilla Zafar. ""Someone told me, 'You have to have some actionable steps.' I thought, boycott."" The boycott ended in 2012, when the kingdom began enforcing a royal decree requiring stores that sell products intended for women, like lingerie and cosmetics, to hire female workers. Supermarkets and other apparel shops also began to hire women under the new policy. The successful campaign taught Ms. Asaad crucial lessons about persistence - and also about the importance of documenting activism and social change, to provide a resource for future change-makers. ""In a country like mine, the people who are looking forward, we who have progressive views of the future, don't necessarily have a manual, a guide to how to do things,"" she said. ""We just need to carve the way."" ""We dictate the future."" Ms. Zafar's first book, ""Arab Women Rising,"" was written with the journalist Nafeesa Syeed and published online by Knowledge@Wharton this year. Ms. Zafar and Ms. Syeed profiled 35 female entrepreneurs in the Middle East and North Africa. Ms. Asaad wrote the introduction. (The entire book is available for free download here.) Even if slow, @reem_asaad says change in #Saudi will come from within. Looking fwd, hoping for better future for daughters #ArabWomenRising - Nafeesa Syeed (@NafeesaSyeed) April 13, 2014 The new book, still untitled, will profile successful Saudi women, from a variety of backgrounds, who are forging new paths in an evolving but insular country. Women in Saudi Arabia are required to get permission from a male guardian to travel, marry and conduct other business. They are also barred from driving and required to wear abayas and headscarves in public. It is a very traditional culture that is difficult for outsiders to fully understand and appreciate, Ms. Asaad said. ""We're going to take a look back at life in Saudi in the past, in the present time and what it may look like in the future given the current trends,"" she said of the book. The country, which boasts very high rates of social media use, has seen growth in technology innovation and entrepreneurship. ""The youth is leading that trend, and they're largely aided by progressive women, financially and ideologically,"" Ms. Asaad said. Having a female clerk ring up shoppers might sound insignificant, Ms. Asaad said, but the change had important cultural implications as thousands of women joined the work force. ""They run them from A to Z,"" she said of the stores. ""From inventory to finance and accounting, to front-line jobs in sales and customer service, customer care and problem-solving. We are seeing an increasing number of capable women who are playing increasingly important roles within the organizations."" Well-educated Saudi women had already been active in education and health care, as well as finance. But retail opened up new avenues for women, including those who had not worked previously. ""That means more independent women, that means more empowered mothers,"" Ms. Asaad said. ""That means more informed and more tolerant future generations. ""I'm quite optimistic.""",2014,"Saudi Arabia"
"202","Taliban and Government Imperil Gains for Afghan Women, Advocates Say","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Advocates say that women's rights and security in Afghanistan are under mounting assault from all sides -- the Taliban insurgency and the government alike -- putting at risk 12 years of hard-won gains for women here. The country's Parliament is about to approve legislation that would strip away crucial legal protections. The insurgents have mounted a string of violent attacks on female officials. And advocates for women are deeply worried by the news that President Hamid Karzai has been negotiating secretly with the Taliban, who enforced hard-line, fundamentalist restrictions on women during their years in power. And the advocates see two potential disasters looming for Afghan women this year. One would be the failure to complete a long-term security agreement with the United States, which could lead to the departure of American and other international forces and aid agencies, by far the strongest proponents for women here. The other is the election in April to choose Mr. Karzai's successor. The slates of many of the 11 candidates for president are dominated by warlords and fundamentalists who share the Taliban's view that women should never be allowed out of their homes. ''Women are not on the agenda now,'' said Huma Safi, an activist with Equality for Peace and Democracy, an advocacy group. ''Every time we turn around, they're passing another law against women.'' The killings of four female police officers since July and the abductions of and assassination attempts against female members of Parliament and their families in Ghazni Province last year have aroused concerns that the Taliban are singling out women for violence and intimidation, though all government officials, male or female, can expect to become targets. The moves in Parliament, on the other hand, seem like attacks from out of nowhere, advocates say, with the potential to do much broader harm. One of the proposed laws would have repealed a requirement that one-quarter of the seats on provincial councils be reserved for women. After intense lobbying, activists managed to get the bill amended to partly preserve the quota, at 20 percent instead of 25; it has been passed and now awaits the president's signature. ''The sworn enemies of women almost got the quota eliminated,'' said Soraya Sobhrang, the representative for women on the national Human Rights Commission. They ''have the power to pave the way for whatever law they want.'' Another proposal would make it easier for a father to arrange child marriages, giving fathers guardianship rights over children that trump those of mothers and the courts. A third would prohibit the nation's courts from hearing testimony of one family member against another, a rule that would make it almost impossible to prosecute domestic violence and abuse cases. Both measures are seen as likely to pass, though the president could refuse to sign them. Manizha Naderi, the head of Women for Afghan Women, a group that runs a network of shelters and counseling centers for abused women and children, said the law on testimony ''virtually provides impunity'' to abusers within the family. Women at the shelters that her group and others run ''include victims whose in-laws, husbands, fathers and sons have broken their arms and legs, chopped off lips, tongues and noses, pulled out fingernails, sold them, stabbed them and left them for dead,'' Ms. Naderi said. The proposed law would prohibit even the victims in cases like those from testifying. In the section on Afghanistan in its worldwide report for 2013, Human Rights Watch said, ''With international interest in Afghanistan rapidly waning, opponents of women's rights seized the opportunity to begin rolling back the progress made since the end of Taliban rule.'' One of the biggest supporters of the bills is a member of Parliament from Herat, Qazi Nazir Ahmad Hanafi, who derides female activists as women of low morals who are un-Islamic. ''Those who are against these laws are people who own shelters, which are run like brothels,'' Mr. Hanafi said. ''These women have not helped women in Afghanistan, they have destroyed families.'' ''This is an Islamic country and women will be treated and respected in accordance with the guidance of Islam, not some communist, secular conspiracy,'' Mr. Hanafi said. Ms. Naderi said she was anxious over Mr. Karzai's pursuit of a deal with the insurgents. ''If the Taliban come back, they're going to come back with a vengeance, and they'll take it out on the women,'' Ms. Naderi said. With 28 facilities helping abused women and children in 10 provinces, Women for Afghan Women would be especially vulnerable, she said, ''Our staff will be the first on the Taliban's list to set an example for others.'' Other activists were not quite that alarmed, at least not yet. ''We are worried, but we are not without hope,'' said Hasina Safi, head of the Afghan Women's Network, an umbrella group of activist organizations. ''We are much bigger in our numbers now, we have established networks, and we are not as isolated as we were in the Taliban time.'' Activists from the women's network and other groups have held a round of meetings with Western embassies over the past three weeks, and they received what Ms. Safi said were oral assurances that financial assistance to Afghan women's groups would not be cut; nearly all such groups depend on money from international donors. In all, more than $100 million a year in aid to Afghanistan is earmarked for women's issues, the United Nations estimates. Ms. Safi said the absence of women from Mr. Karzai's talks with the Taliban was a major concern. There are women on the country's High Peace Council, but Ms. Safi said they had been paid little heed, and the council itself is not closely involved in the talks. Nader Nadery, director of the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, said women had gained political strength by building alliances. ''Afghan women's groups have moved from being individual voices,'' Mr. Nadery said. ''They are now a very powerful collective voice, if not a full-fledged movement, and it will be difficult for any politician to ignore them completely.'' Ms. Sobhrang, the representative on the Human Rights Commission, said 30 activists had drafted a charter on women's rights that they plan to debate at a larger forum of female activists next week, and then use to assess candidates in the election, predicting that they would endorse one or two. That could make an impact in the crowded field. At least one-third of registered Afghan voters are women, and their advocacy groups tend to have more money and organizing experience than many of the inexperienced presidential campaigns. Ms. Sobhrang called the gains women have made since the ouster of Taliban rule in 2002 ''fragile but reversible,'' a phrase often used by American military leaders in a broader context. ''We still haven't brought fundamental change to the lives of women in Afghanistan,'' she said. Four weeks ago, the country got its first female police chief, Col. Jamila Bayaz, who was given command of the sprawling District 1 headquarters in Kabul. Colonel Bayaz, who is one of 2,000 women who have joined or rejoined the police force since 2002, said she was aware of the concerns about retaining the gains women have made. She began her career 32 years ago, when women were as numerous in the police force as they are now, an accomplishment interrupted by civil war and the ascent of the Taliban. She does not think that will happen again. ''I'm sure our international friends will not abandon us,'' the colonel said.",2014,"Afghanistan"
"203","Gender Inequality in Morocco Continues, Despite Amendments to Family Law","MENA","When Zineb lost her father at the age of 15, her grief was compounded when she learned that she had to share his inheritance with an older half-brother unknown to her or her mother and sister. ''It felt unfair to split it with him,'' said Zineb, 29, a teacher in Rabat who asked that her full name not be used because as a political activist she is concerned about her safety. ''Somebody was parachuted into your life and we didn't know him and after all, my mom worked for half of all of that money.'' A decade ago, Morocco adopted a family code hailed by women's rights groups as a big step forward. Three years ago, the country passed a new constitution guaranteeing gender equality. Even so, Moroccan women say that equality is still a long way off, and much of the old order remains untouched, including the inheritance law section of the family code. That law, laid down in the Quran, states that male relatives receive double the inheritance of women. But the pressure for change is building. ''Islam allows for reinterpretation, and it is time for radical decisions to protect women,'' said Saida Kouzzi, a founding partner at Mobilizing for Rights Associates, a nongovernmental organization based in Morocco. ''This law of inheritance was based on the fact that men were the head of the households, which is not the case anymore as many women are the ones who provide for the family or at least contribute in a significant manner.'' In 2004, Morocco rewrote its code of family law, establishing the right to divorce by mutual consent, placing limits on polygamy and raising the minimum marriage age for women to 18 from 15. But no changes were made with respect to inheritance. At the time, the Moroccan ruler, King Mohammed VI, had to arbitrate between the demands of feminist organizations, who were calling for an expansion of women's rights, and the Islamic political parties, who were strongly resistant to change. But terrorist bombings in 2003 that killed 45 people in Casablanca weakened the Islamist parties and paved the way for the adoption of the new family code. The king seized that opportunity to make it clear that he was the country's top religious authority. ''I can't in my capacity as commander of the faithful, permit what God has forbidden, nor forbid what the Almighty has allowed,'' the king said in an October 2003 address to Parliament about the changes to the family code. He also hinted that he would push to loosen religious rules without completely rejecting them. Analysts said it was a clever strategy. ''It was definitely a strong marketing move,'' said Abdellah Tourabi, a political science researcher and the editor of the Moroccan monthly magazine Zamane. ''It was the fourth year of his reign, and the move gave him the image of a modernist and a reformer. He became a sort of bulwark against conservatism and Islamism and a strategic ally for the secular elites.'' Still, human rights organizations say that, in practice, the changes have not been fully carried out, mainly because some judges have been finding ways around the law or are still unfamiliar with the amendments. Although the law now states that 18 is the minimum marriage age, judges have granted permission for the marriage of minors in about 90 percent of the cases that have appeared before them, according to 2010 data reported by the Justice Ministry. ''It takes much more time for changes in the law to be translated into practice,'' said Ziba Mir-Hosseini, a research associate specializing in women and Islamic law at the Centre for Islamic and Middle Eastern Law at the University of London. ''Studies show that it takes about one generation or 30 years for legislation to push society in a different direction.'' ''Many families in rural areas are really eager to have their daughters marry much earlier,'' she added. ''Judges have to go by the reality on the ground.'' In conservative Morocco, the reality is that even women may be reluctant to challenge Islamic traditions that discriminate against them. ''Women are very attached to the book and it is very clear on inheritance,'' said Sonia Terrab, a Moroccan novelist, referring to the Quran. ''If given the choice, they will reject reform. There needs to be a strong state that imposes it until it becomes a solid gain in two or three generations.'' In December, Driss Lachgar, secretary general of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, an opposition party, demanded the repeal of laws that discriminate against women and called for a national debate on the inheritance law. Although his message stirred some controversy, no national or legislative debate ensued. Ms. Kouzzi, the human rights worker, said the enforcement of the inheritance law had serious consequences: Many families disintegrate after the death of the father, and sometimes the survivors lose their homes. Many Moroccans, she said, have discovered ways to work around the law, registering their properties in the name of their daughters, if they do not have a son, to guarantee that the inheritance stays within the nuclear family. To radically change a traditional law, scholars say, it is necessary to accept that Muslim societies like Morocco are deeply conservative. Feminists and other groups seeking change must work with conservatives and avoid using alienating language. ''This issue cannot be addressed without taking into consideration what Moroccans consider to be their identity: Islam,'' said Souad Eddouada, a professor at the University of Kenitra in Morocco who specializes in gender studies. ''This is a very tough battle to win for feminists because it touches money and property. Islam is based on the concept of justice, so a new reading of the texts can open the way to reforms even with inheritance.'' Many believe that this kind of change will not be possible in Morocco unless the king provides the impetus. But Zineb, the teacher who lost her father, said change was bound to happen despite the serious challenge it would pose to the privileges of men. Until then, she is making special provisions for her 8-year-old daughter. ''My advice to all women is to make sure they put the stuff in the kids' names,'' she said. ''And they have to do it while they're alive so the law doesn't take away the girls' rights.''",2014,"Morocco"
"204","100 Girls' Schools In Afghan Capital Are Ordered Shut","MENA","The Islamic movement that controls most of Afghanistan today ordered the closing of more than 100 private schools here that have been educating girls. The movement, the Taliban, has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls, including barring them from schools and most workplaces. The closing edict includes scores of small home-based vocational training programs, many of them run by international aid groups, that teach girls and young women to weave carpets and sew. Supporters say the classes are vital to rebuilding the country after years of civil war. Under the new rules, the Taliban will issue licenses to schools, but only after scrutinizing their objectives. Schools will not be allowed to teach girls older than 8 and will be limited to lessons about the Koran, the Muslim holy book. The schools to be closed, the Government said today, violated those rules. ""These schools weren't just for children -- they also included 14- and 15-year-old girls,"" Religious Affairs Minister Haji Khulimuddin said at a news conference. The home-based schools have been run by thousands of women, teachers who were forced out of work by the Taliban after they took control of Kabul in 1996 and imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law. Without officially recognizing the schools, the Taliban have until now allowed them to operate. ""Right now, we have no control over these schools,"" Mr. Khulimuddin said. ""If they get permission, then we can control them."" The Taliban's proscriptions on women have raised international concern. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited the country earlier this year and called the edicts on women ""despicable."" United Nations aid officials have made similar comments. In meetings with Western officials, Taliban leaders have expressed a willingness to discuss the restrictions, but say the move to keep women out of public life is driven primarily by Afghan tribal traditions. The Taliban movement consists of former tribesmen who until the takeover in 1996 had been students in rural religious schools.",1998,"Afghanistan"
"205","BOOKS OF THE TIMES; Confronting the Barbarity of Hatred","MENA","SCAPEGOAT The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation By Andrea Dworkin 436 pages. The Free Press. $28. During the course of her new book, ""Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation,"" Andrea Dworkin makes some extraordinary remarks aimed at bringing home her main point: that hatred of Jews and hatred of women are two closely related consequences of a similar thirst to dominate the weak. She quotes from a 1995 book on Arab women, for example, asserting that the Israeli Army ""may be the only one in the world"" whose members routinely ""sexually expose themselves"" as ""a means to disperse Arab women demonstrators or groups of women."" Then, in a passage on the supposed subordination of women in Judaism, she cites a rabbinical interpretation of adultery that, according to Ms. Dworkin, allows men to be unfaithful to their wives. One result of this theological ruse, she writes, is that ""Orthodox Jews, post-Holocaust and in Israel, are major users of prostitutes."" It is statements like these -- and there are numerous others in Ms. Dworkin's new book -- that illustrate the intemperate, extremist and intellectually seedy side to a book that in other respects is a learned and thought-provoking etiology of hatred through history. You don't have to be an avid supporter of Israel to feel a surge of skepticism over that report of routine exposure as a crowd-control method. Ms. Dworkin, however, ever ready to believe the worst about male behavior, accepts it and reproduces it without any visible attempt at verification. As for the frequency with which Israeli Orthodox men visit prostitutes, one is naturally led to ask how Ms. Dworkin would know that. She gives no source at all for this information, though her book is generally heavily footnoted. There are, in short, many problems with this passionate, overburdened and overwrought book, not the least of them that it is more an angry rant than a cogent, careful argument. Ms. Dworkin's main point is that the oppression both of women and of Jews through history, of which there has certainly been a horrifyingly large amount, reflects a kind of sexualized violence, a will to dominate. In this sense, she argues, the Jews have been turned into women by those who wanted to dominate them, the women into Jews. Or, as Ms. Dworkin puts it: ""Contempt for Jews is warranted because contempt for women is normative; both Jews and women have been locked in at night, Jews in ghettos, women in houses. Because, like women, Jews have not fought back, the men are taken to be biologically deviant in having none of the violent pride that distinguishes men from women."" Leaving aside that subtly insinuated notion that violent pride is a universal male characteristic, there is certainly something to that argument, which Ms. Dworkin substantiates in a wide-ranging ramble through the rich history of human cruelty and depravity. She writes with stylistic eloquence and command, and she has read widely. Her new book is full of gripping passages on Nazi behavior, which Ms. Dworkin rightly sees as an apex of sexualized human cruelty, and she distills many of her ideas into pithy aphorisms: ""Every one of these rapists is a Nazi; and every one of the raped is a Jew: which is to say that rape is a manifestation of sexual fascism, the woman the scapegoated victim."" Still, ""Scapegoat"" makes you think of one of those arcade games in which enemies are always appearing out of the scenery and you have to blow them away quickly, before you have a good chance to see exactly who they are, and Ms. Dworkin sees many enemies. Her overall conviction is that a sexualized will to dominate is a historical constant, one that women will escape only when they hold ultimate political power: ""Women either are the state or women are resubordinated."" In this sense ""Scapegoat"" continues the themes already developed in past work by Ms. Dworkin, who has written many books on violence against women. Her comment about Orthodox men and prostitutes is part of a larger thesis developed in ""Scapegoat"": Israelis have overcompensated for the historical weakness of European Jews, their womanlike character of passivity in the face of oppression, by becoming macho dominators themselves, of women and of Palestinians, whose manhood has been taken away from them. ""Of course once Jewish men became physical, no longer gentle or weak, they had to own Jewish women in a new roughhouse sort of way,"" she writes. And then: ""In male culture the nature of women is simply a movable feast from whip wielder to abject victim; but both justify eventual male violence."" But even if one shares Ms. Dworkin's natural horror at the prevalence of violence against women, and at such phenomena as female infanticide in China or the sexual apartheid practiced against women in some Muslim countries, ""Scapegoat"" remains untrustworthy, troubling in its extremism. Ms. Dworkin's book reads like a catalog of infamous things with what often seem to be isolated, or even aberrational instances, generalized to represent an unspeakable whole. Her summary of Jewish theology and practice contains so many half-truths and misinterpretations that it would take another book to refute them all. Suffice it to say that it is not true that 613 of the religious commandments apply to men and only 2 to women, or that women granted divorces by religious courts in Israel are required to exit the scene bowing gratefully to their husbands. Ms. Dworkin's indefatigable quest for the violence of the male culture leads her to range widely. For example, she cites the practice of suttee -- by which widows are burned alive on the funeral pyres of their husbands -- to represent pretty much the whole of the female condition in India. Nowhere does she tell us how widespread this barbaric and illegal practice is, but she does make this rather remarkable declaration: ""In India, women can be murdered with impunity any time in life."" No reasonable person would declare India to be a feminist paradise, but Ms. Dworkin's unsubstantiated allegations show more of a superheated imagination than assiduous research. The unreliability of her reporting, the very avidity of her quest to prove the absolute inevitability of testosterone-driven violence, transforms ""Scapegoat"" from scholarship to a kind of agitprop and spoils what might otherwise have been a vigorous explanation for the worst in human behavior.  http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Israel"
"206","Measure of Equality","MENA","To the Editor: ""In Iran, More Women Leaving Nest for University"" (news article, July 22) exemplifies what is happening with remarkable speed all over the world. The extent of coeducation is, perhaps more than any other, a measure of the emergence of women with full rights. No other extension of women's rights establishes as clearly as does coeducation that women are fully the intellectual, social and economic equals of men. Coeducation implies acceptance of women at a level of equality very rarely achieved in history before our own time. It is useful to recall that it was only in 1833 that Oberlin College became the first fully coeducational institution of higher education in America, and that many leading American universities became coeducational only in the last 30 years.

"207","Iran Assembly Pushes on Women's Rights","MENA","Iran's reformist Parliament, fresh from a slap by the country's supreme leader, who ordered it to drop a bill for press reform, showed its determination today to forge ahead with social change and grant women additional rights by raising the marriage age. The vote will be reflected in the draft of a bill to change a law introduced just after the Islamic revolution in 1979 that lets fathers marry off their daughters as young as 9. More than two-thirds of the 290-member assembly voted for the change, the first major step since Parliament began its session in May. Fatimeh Haghighatjoo, a reformist legislator who pledged in her election campaign to fight for women's rights, said Parliament would probably vote to increase the age when girls and boys can marry, to 15 or 16, although many in reformers favor 18. The ages before the revolution were 18 for women and 20 for men. The debate occurred three days after the most senior cleric in Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say in state matters, ordered the legislature to drop a bill aimed at restoring a free press. The new bill would require the approval of the Council of Guardians, a generally hard-line body. Lawmakers who opposed the change said it would be against Islamic law. ""I beg of you not to vote,"" said a member of Parliament who opposed the draft bill, Mohammad Ali Sheik.  ""Islamic scholars have put a lot of efforts into these laws."" But other members of Parliament argued that marriage at a young age often hurt families and society. ""We live in a society in which women's rights, the human rights of very young girls, are ignored under this law,"" one legislator, Elaheh Koulai, said. ""You see a child married at the age of 9 who is forced to get involved in daily economic problems. The law must provide appropriately for such children."" http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Iran"
"208","Voting Rights in Kuwait","MENA","Kuwait is further along the road toward social liberalism than most of its Persian Gulf neighbors, with a woman at the helm of Kuwait University, a female ambassador and women outnumbering men in public schools. But if Kuwaitis are to achieve any semblance of the country's constitutional guarantee of ""equal rights"" for men and women, full political rights must be granted to women. That would serve as an example for other gulf nations that have yet to give women the right to vote. Kuwaiti feminists recently suffered a setback when the constitutional court dismissed cases petitioning for women's voting rights. Activists and government officials who favor the change have to push harder on an issue that the nation's Islamist majority views as a threat to traditional values. Kuwait's highest court rejected the cases on procedural grounds. The plaintiffs had challenged the constitutionality of a law that grants the vote only to certain men. The law contradicts the Constitution's guarantee of equal rights for men and women. Since the court is unwilling to act, lobbying pressure must be applied to Parliament. Conservative tribal and Islamist legislators worked together last year to overturn a decree by the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, that would have given women the right to vote and stand for public office. This coalition also narrowly defeated a suffrage bill, 32 to 30. The thin margin can be reversed with energetic campaigning. The cause warrants renewed support from the Council of Ministers, the prime minister and the emir. The emir and his cabinet must secure the lead on this issue and take swift steps toward drafting women's rights measures and mobilizing parliamentary acceptance of them. Kuwaiti women deserve the support of their government in their struggle to gain a voice in their nation's politics. http://www.nytimes.com",2000,"Kuwait"

(news article, Sept. 21): As long as the Taliban government in Afghanistan bars women and girls from schools and employment; insists that they wear a burqa, which covers them from head to toe; and mandates that they be accompanied by a male relative whenever they are in public, women's organizations around the world will oppose recognition of the Taliban by the United Nations. The United Nations stands for peace and the rights of all people: women and men, boys and girls. The Taliban use war and poverty as reasons for denying women the most basic rights.

"210","In Egypt, Law of Man Creates A Caste of Shunned Children","MENA","In Egypt, as in most of the Arab world, children born to women who marry foreigners often endure a painful awakening that they are not quite like other citizens. In every country except for Tunisia, in fact, they are not considered citizens at all. For Joseph Aladdin Huber, the devastating moment came at age 12, just after he won his opening match in the national tennis championship for young players. A referee ousted him, saying it was reserved for Egyptians and he did not qualify since his father was Austrian and only his mother Egyptian. Iman Ahmed Wahid was dismissed from school at age 12, when she tried to enter the equivalent of junior high. Her elementary school had somehow overlooked the fact that her father was Syrian, but the upper school demanded the tuition required of all foreigners, money her family could not afford. Her formal education effectively ended that day. Women's organizations across the Arab world have taken up cases of people like Joseph and Iman to highlight the demand for sweeping new citizenship laws, arguing that the existing ones discriminate against women and wreak untold damage on children. ""It is very tribal, which is why Arabs in many countries are against changing it,"" says Dr. Iman Bibars, director of the Association for the Enhancement and Development of Women, a group spearheading the fight to rewrite Egypt's laws. ""Women belong to the tribe, so if you go to another tribe to marry, you are no longer one of us."" Changing the law to allow women who marry foreigners to pass on citizenship to their children is an uphill battle across the region because it touches on a broad range of delicate issues ranging from prostitution to state security to the Arab male's image of himself. ""The male mentality prefers that the family be linked to the man, under his control, so that he is the person who gives them their status in the society,"" said Asma Khader, a human rights lawyer working to change Jordan's citizenship laws. ""If children feel that their mothers cannot provide them with the same protection as their fathers, then the whole status of women will remain less important."" While Middle Eastern countries have their own traditions that make them resistant to the change, similar citizenship laws were overturned on the basis of discrimination in Western European countries only in the early 1980's. Although much of Middle Eastern law is derived from European systems, only in Tunisia, which has the strongest women's rights laws, were citizenship rules altered in 1993. Opponents of the restrictions hope that the Egyptian effort will succeed, as it could influence the rest of the region. Although the problem has been recognized for some time, women's groups say they are pushing the debate now since globalization is increasing the number of such marriages. Still, it is difficult to pin down exactly how many women in any Arab country marry foreigners. In Egypt, the statistics range from the dubious official figure of 50,000 to 287,000 according to the Center for the Rights of Women. The number of Egyptian children believed affected ranges from 150,000 to nearly one million. Children of foreign fathers cannot go to public school here or state universities free, are barred from certain professional schools like medicine or engineering even if they are willing to pay, and cannot get jobs without residency and work permits for foreigners. The most widespread objection is rooted in the numbers. Opponents say Egypt, as a developing country with nearly 70 million people, cannot afford to suddenly add another million citizens. Many vociferous critics also claim that allowing mothers to pass on their nationality will encourage what some call thinly disguised prostitution. Every summer hordes of older men descend on Egypt from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other rich Persian Gulf states, buy a young village girl as a bride for a few months, then abandon her pregnant. A number of regulations devised to thwart the practice, like requiring a bank deposit of more than $5,000 if the age difference between the two to be married is more than 25 years, are easily circumvented. Women's organizations say a whole network of sleazy lawyers prey on poor villages known for their attractive women, with destitute families willing to sell daughters into unofficial marriages. ""There are brokers who the Saudi men go to and say, 'I want a girl, I want her fat, I want her blond, I want her young,' "" Mrs. Bibars said. ""You end up with entire villages where many of the kids are not citizens."" The fathers do not register them at home, so they cannot get any identity papers. With 30 percent of all marriages to foreigners involving Gulf Arabs, opponents of changing the citizenship law say it is the one disincentive to the practice. ""Every woman wants an apartment, a car,"" said Azza al-Kashef, a member of Parliament from the ruling National Democratic Party who denounced the proposed changes. ""The guy will get her these things and six months later he is gone. She is not looking for a good relationship in order to bring up children to serve the country."" Several attempts are under way to change the law, which the National Council for Women has adopted as a priority issue. A draft law has been submitted to Parliament -- even though an earlier attempt was flattened by opposition from the Ministry of the Interior. Lawyers are also trying to get one of several court cases all the way to the highest court, the constitutional court. They want to argue that the law violates the Constitution, which guarantees equal rights for all Egyptians. The foreign wives and children of Egyptian men are given citizenship automatically. Opponents frequently argue that a revised law would contradict Islamic teachings, but no religious leaders have weighed in with official misgivings. Proponents of change say religion might be neutral because there were no states at the time of the Prophet Muhammad. They point out that Muhammad had only daughters, so his descendants all arrived at their status through women. And Islamic tradition holds that on the Day of Judgment, the righteous will be summoned according to their mother's names. Opponents often cite a a national security concern: children of Egyptian mothers and Israeli fathers, they say, would become natural-born spies since they would be citizens of both nations, but are likely to be more loyal to their father's. Women's rights advocates argue that the children of Arab fathers and Israeli mothers are automatically dual citizens. (Most such marriages involve Palestinian citizens of Israel.) Those seeking change are focusing less on the issue of women's rights than on the problems children face. ""There is always resistance to changing any law that has to do with women,"" said Rabea Naciri, a Moroccan lawyer. ""I think the question of nationality might face fewer problems because it also affects the children."" Young adults born of foreign fathers say their biggest problem is feeling like strangers in the only place they really know. ""Here in Austria everybody is Christian and I am a Muslim and I don't feel integrated,"" said Joseph Huber, now 17 and pursing his tennis career in his father's country. ""I want to get the Egyptian citizenship because I love Egypt and I lived there over 16 years and my mother is Egyptian and my heart is simply just for Egypt."" His mother says she faces constant rebukes, especially whenever she has to show passports at Egyptian border controls. ""I am always harassed by officers asking why I couldn't find an Egyptian to marry,"" Soumaya Ibrahim Huber said. The Hubers recognize that Joseph and his younger sister, May, are in relatively privileged positions having Austrian passports to fall back on. The children of fathers from other Arab countries face the most difficulty, given that Middle Eastern governments often treat one another's citizens with contempt. ""Some of these women married as a result of unity with Arab countries like Syria, Yemen and Libya, so now what can they do?"" said Faiza Tahnawi, an independent member of Parliament who introduced the latest draft law on citizenship. ""When the politics change, the women suffer the consequences."" Iman Wahid, now 28, says that although she has lived her whole life in Alexandria, speaks Egyptian Arabic and has never left Egypt, the Egyptian government considers her Syrian because of her father. The Syrians call her Egyptian. Miss Wahid says she and her four siblings often get pinioned between regulations. At the moment they are having trouble getting residency permits because the Egyptians say they must have Syrian passports to obtain one, while the Syrian Embassy refuses to issue passports unless they produce Egyptian residency permits. She is forced to change jobs every few months. Miss Wahid notes that girls have an out; they can just marry an Egyptian and eventually get the citizenship. Boys, however, are caught in an endless circle since their children will face the same problem. Miss Wihad thinks that she, like all others in a similar predicament, deserves to be recognized simply for who she is. ""When people hear that I am Syrian they say, 'You are welcome in Egypt!' "" she scoffs. ""What is this 'Welcome in Egypt?' I am Egyptian.  I was born here.""",2001,"Egypt"
"211","Woman With a New View of Culture","MENA","At the end of June, the United Nations will hold an unprecedented special session on how to combat AIDS, and a Muslim woman from conservative Saudi Arabia will be in the thick of the debate. She is Thoraya Obaid, who since late last year has led the United Nations Population Fund, an agency that has been propelled into the heart of this issue. She was Secretary General Kofi Annan's attention-getting choice to lead this organization, whose function has been revolutionized by force of circumstance. Once a dispenser of family planning supplies, it has become a leading campaigner for safer sex. For the General Assembly to call a special session about an illness is both out of character and out of season. It shows the high level of concern about AIDS, and the debate will not be for the squeamish. To be effective, AIDS experts say, the member nations will have to confront some undiplomatic realities like the trafficking of women, the rights of prostitutes, drug addicts' dirty needles and the considerable -- but in many places hidden -- population of men who have sex with men. Ms. Obaid comes from an Arab country where women's rights are still severely limited and homosexuality is not widely discussed. In preparatory meetings for the session on AIDS, Arab nations have resisted explicit wording on gay sex as well as on women's rights and adolescent sexuality. But then, so have representatives of the Vatican and some members of the Bush administration, to the consternation of American anti-AIDS campaigners. That confrontation, Ms. Obaid said in an interview, should serve as warning about the need for participants to be sensitive to cultural differences. From her vantage point, she added, the battle over semantics still often masks a more basic global split. The frank and explicit language about sex that is often demanded by Westerners when United Nations documents are written makes compromise -- and progress on vital issues -- difficult, she said. ""The North needs to change the way it addresses the South,"" she said. ""Because if you attend the debates, it always appears as if the South is wrong and they have to change -- that they have nothing good in their culture or their society and we are teaching them what needs to be done."" Ms. Obaid has lived her life across this cultural divide. Born in Baghdad in 1945, she grew up in Saudi Arabia at a time when there were no secular schools for girls. At age 3 she was sent to a religious school. But she had parents who wanted more for her and their seven other children. Her father, Ahmed Obaid, a journalist and Arab classicist who was something of a dissident, and her mother, Aisha Khatib, sent her at age 6 to the American College for Girls in Cairo, a private school where she remained through 12th grade. ""It was quite a sacrifice for my father,"" she said. ""I think he sacrificed for my education throughout his life. He was a devout Muslim, and my mother is a devout Muslim. They felt that it was an Islamic obligation to educate us."" Her father, not a rich man, told his children their education would be their legacy, she said. Ms. Obaid went on to Mills College in Oakland, Calif., and then to Wayne State University in Detroit, where she earned a master of arts degree and a Ph.D. in literature and social anthropology. She began her career with the United Nations in 1975, at the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia. She is married to Mahmoud Saleh, an Egyptian expert in alternative energy sources. Two grown daughters from an earlier marriage, a doctor and an architect, live in Britain. Saudi Arabia has changed dramatically over her lifetime, she said. She was the Saudi candidate for her job, and the job is contributing to the process of change. ""My appointment has certainly made me very visible in the country,"" she said. ""I was in Saudi Arabia about three weeks ago. I met the king. I met the crown prince, the prime minister, the deputy minister of foreign affairs, the minister of planning, the minister of health. I was on Saudi Arabian television for an hour. That never happened before."" Throughout the Arab counties and much of the Islamic world, she said, family planning activities have been very successful. ""We really do not have problems with family planning in Arab countries or in the Muslim world,"" she said. She said the questions that arise are over services for adolescents because the culture believes that sex should be reserved for marriage. Looking for the cultural opening, Ms. Obaid said, she reminds Muslim leaders that many girls are indeed married very young. She said that when policies are written, she advises a vague linguistic compromise that allows for family planning services to adolescents ""as appropriate."" Ms. Obaid said that in dealing with Islamic societies, she is working with the center for population research at Al Azhar University in Egypt to create materials that address reproductive health from a Muslim perspective. Islamic nations are also looking for appropriate responses to AIDS. In a new survey of national attitudes, the United Nations population division found that while infection rates are very low in the Middle East and North Africa, leading Arab countries reported that they have a major level of concern about the spread of the illness. Ways will have to be found to broach the subject of AIDS ""within the cultural context."" She said. ""If you offend the cultural environment, you really lose rather than win."" Ms. Obaid remains committed, however, to some strong positions on the right of women to control their sexual lives that the Population Fund adopted under her predecessor, Dr. Nafis Sadik of Pakistan, also a Muslim. ""We should be empowering women to say no to sex, or at least insist on safe sex,"" Ms. Obaid said. She will also continue to campaign against female genital mutilation, while urging communities to come up with more symbolic rites of passage for girls at puberty. Turning to Afghanistan, where the rights of women are at their lowest ebb anywhere, Ms. Obaid noted that the ruling Taliban movement is based in the Pashtun ethnic group, which she said is culturally conservative. The Taliban ""are supposed to be the puritanical ones,"" she said. ""But in Saudi Arabia, the Wahabis really are the puritans, yet one of the greatest advances there has been in girls' education. It's one of our main success stories.""",2001,"Saudi Arabia"
"212","Some Progress for Turkish Women","MENA","As a result of a change in the law this spring, school officials in Turkey are no longer authorized to test girls for virginity. In recent years, Turkey has also overturned the legal supremacy of men in marriage and allowed women threatened with violence to get orders of protection. These vital moves represent welcome progress, but the very need for them illustrates how far Turkey still has to go to protect the rights of women and girls. Geographically divided between Europe and Asia, Turkey is a nation of contradictions. Equality for women in the public sphere was decreed by the founder of the modern nation, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in the 1920's and 30's. Abortion is legal and the law mandates equal pay for equal work. By the standards of Muslim nations, Turkey is a model of progressivism. Yet Islam and rural traditions still heavily influence the treatment of women. The law on student chastity, for example, burst back into public attention last year after Turkey's health minister announced that students in nursing and other health schools should be expelled if they were sexually active. In the remote southeast and east, about 10 percent of women are in polygamous marriages -- even though the practice is illegal -- and women are still taken by their families for virginity tests or compelled to renounce their legal inheritance in favor of brothers. Women are forced to marry their rapists to salvage the reputation of their families, and some are killed by their families for flouting tradition, even for doing nothing more than going out at night with female friends. The new laws are partly aimed at facilitating Turkey's longstanding effort to join the European Union, but they are also the product of a unified campaign by dozens of women's groups. These organizations warn that unless the state goes beyond the mere passage of laws, change will be very slow. There are few shelters for battered women or those threatened with honor killings. The national government does not push local governments to enforce women's rights. One change that could help Turkey would come from extending girls' education. Far fewer girls are in school than boys. Especially in the rural east, women's scandalous dropout rates rob them of opportunities for jobs, leaving them dependent on their families and thus more susceptible to traditional pressures. A stay-in-school program could do more than any law to make women truly equal citizens of Turkey.",2002,"Turkey"
"213","Iran Legislators Vote to Give Women Equality in Divorce","MENA","Iran's reformist Parliament has approved a bill that would grant women a right to seek a divorce equal to that of men for the first time since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The bill would have to be approved by the hard-line Guardian Council to become law, and that is unlikely. But its approval in Parliament is considered a big victory both for women and reformist politicians. who have consistently sought the support of women, because it creates public pressure on the country's conservative Islamic rulers. Under the civil code adopted after the 1979 revolution, ""a man can divorce his wife whenever he wishes."" The bill would replace that section of the code with a provision that gives men and women equal right to divorce, but sets the ground on which a divorce could be sought -- addiction, mental illness or violent behavior -- to make it more difficult in either case. Another provision of the bill would require a man to pay for health care if his wife became ill. At present, if a man refuses to pay for his wife's care, the case is sent to court, and judges have not consistently ruled in favor of the wives. Hard-liners expressed opposition to the bill. ""The language of the bill is not in accordance with the norms of our society,"" wrote the daily Entekhab, run by Taha Hashemi, a student of the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reformist women in Parliament have previously tried to change laws that discriminate against women but their efforts have been blocked or altered by the clerical establishment. A bill that would have raised the legal marriage age for girls from 9 to 15 was blocked for months by the Guardian Council, which contended that it went against Shariah, or Islamic law. Eventually, the Expediency Council, which resolves differences between Parliament and the Guardian Council, approved raising the minimum age, but only to 13. Women in Parliament proposed that Iran join the United Nations Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, but members abruptly dropped consideration of the plan after hard-line clerics in the religious city of Qum declared that the convention was against Islam. ""I become more persistent whenever I feel there are pressures not to change an unjust or discriminatory situation,"" said Fatimen Rakei, a reformist member of Parliament. ""All the other women in Parliament feel that way.""",2002,"Iran"
"214","Half the Afghans, the Women, Fight to Establish Their Rights","MENA","When Afghanistan's grand council convenes next week to begin creating a new political order, one task will be to select the writers of a new Constitution. There has never been a moment with more promise -- or long-term danger -- for Afghan women. Three of them -- a lawyer, a law professor and a judge -- brought that message to New York this week, along with an urgent plea for help, meeting with American foundations, law firms and the Bar Association of the City of New York. Soraya Paikan, a lawyer and member of the grand council, or loya jirga, said in an interview on Monday that there are signs that newly won women's freedoms are already under threat, and that women must take part in writing the Constitution if they are to achieve protection. The task of drawing women into the process can seem overwhelming. ""Afghan women don't know their rights,"" said Ms. Paikan, 42, a founder of the Afghan Women Lawyers and Professionals Association, which emerged in January from four years underground. She is in New York with two colleagues from the association's board -- Hangama Anwari, a law scholar, and Nafisa Kabuli, a judge in the struggling juvenile justice system. The association has trained 40 women in basic human rights. It wants to send dozens more across Afghanistan to explain to women in towns and rural villages about the evolution of political life and how they can work to ensure that developments work to their advantage. The women brought a meticulous list of what their association needs, from chairs and kitchen items to a car and eight computers, to open a center in Kabul. All told, they need $237,600. It seems a lot to them. Visibility is equally important. Ms. Anwari, 26, said, ""One of the purposes of our visit here -- beside getting some financial and material support from outsiders -- is to introduce the aims and the goals and the dreams of Afghan women lawyers to the international community."" The women spoke at the offices of Equality Now, an organization that works on women's rights in more than 100 countries. Afghanistan once had hundreds of women trained in law. For 57 years, before women were banned by the Taliban, Kabul University graduated coeducational law classes that included 20 to 40 women a year. But they were not active in political life and women's rights. Many also left the country during the last 23 years of war. Ms. Kabuli, 41, was among those who stayed and worked underground, and she is now a judge dealing with youthful offenders; girls as well as boys are often charged with robbery in these difficult economic times, she said. During Taliban rule, from 1996 until last fall, she ran one of hundreds of clandestine home schools for girls. ""One of the first violations of the Taliban against women was that they instantly got rid of the female judges,"" Ms. Kabuli said. ""As a consequence of that, and because the schools were closed, I had a home school and taught up to 300 students. The girls had to come one by one to school because if they came a group, they might have been arrested."" Ms. Kabuli said the problem with the Taliban was not that they were Muslims. ""Islam brought a certain equality to men and women,"" she said. ""The laws that the Taliban brought were from pre-Islamic times, based on traditional law."" Those traditions die hard, Ms. Paikan said.",2002,"Afghanistan"

A Human Rights Watch report published in May claims that most Afghan women continue to fear physical violence and repression.

"216","Persian Progress","MENA","INSIDE IRAN: Women's Lives By Jane Howard. Illustrated. 255 pp. Washington: Mage Publishers. $29.95. JANE HOWARD, a former BBC correspondent, accompanied her husband to Iran when he was sent there on a United Nations mission in 1996. They lived there until 2000, and during those years she became interested in the situation of Iranian women. Based on extensive research, interviews and personal observations, ""Inside Iran: Women's Lives"" shows us vividly what life is like in Iran today, and some of what the author has to say will probably surprise many Western readers. Howard points out that while the Islamic regime has introduced harsh restrictions for women and even harsher penalties, some of the most harmful laws were imposed under the shah. She also finds that the regime has taken more steps to improve women's lives than is generally understood. A great deal of money has been spent on schools, especially in rural areas neglected by the shah, for example, and as a result, in today's Iran (unlike Afghanistan), 97 percent of children between the ages of 6 and 10 are enrolled in primary schools. In addition, by the year 2000, more women than men were entering universities, and most women aim to get good jobs when they graduate. These statistics are illuminated by what a researcher for Unicef told Howard: ""You talk to girls from 20 to 30 and most of them are dead set on getting a good job. Previously everyone was dead set on getting themselves a rich husband."" Health too has improved for women, Howard says. She finds that, as with education, the Islamic government has channeled resources toward health education and opening up clinics in remote, previously deprived areas. ""From 1985 to 1997, the maternal mortality rate dropped from 140 deaths per 100,000 live births to 37.4 per 100,000,"" she writes. Interestingly, Howard concludes that some of women's gains have come about as a result not just of government policy but of arbitrariness in enforcing the law (the shah's secret police were much more efficient). Because the rules are not consistently enforced, strong-minded women manage to get around many of them. ""Time and time again in Iran you hear stories about women who struggle against the laws ranged against them, and who frequently beat the odds, triumphing through sheer force of personality,"" she writes. They ""confront the laws of covering up, traveling, marriage and divorce."" She introduces us to women all across the country, rich and poor, urban and peasant, and through them shows how in present-day Iran, they can overcome many of the obstacles to freedom. A new shelter in Tehran provides refuge for girls fleeing oppressive homes; in a cafe young men and women sit together defiantly -- slipping out the back door in case a policeman walks in; girls even cruise in their cars to meet boys. One educated young woman told Howard: ""I'm not unhappy. . . . Because we make our own freedom for ourselves, we do what we want."" Another woman, a human rights lawyer, said to her: ""We're like cacti in the desert. You have to be strong to survive."" HAVING lived in Iran under the shah and visited a few times during the current regime, I found Howard's account convincing. On my last visit, for instance, I met several young women who had managed to get divorces by persuading the court that their husbands were not performing their husbandly duties. One of them had gotten custody of her son -- which my sister wasn't granted when she left her abusive husband during the shah's regime. The blending of research and personal experience isn't seamless in ""Inside Iran"" -- the book has a certain jumpiness to it -- but it is still very much worth reading. The personal stories Howard presents are moving and colorful, and they enable us to understand Iranian women more fully than cold statistics would allow. In the end, the book gives hope for the future of Iranian women, hope that American observers sometimes fail to convey.",2002,"Iran"
"217","AFTER THE WAR: THE CLERGY; Iraqi Career Women Ponder A Future Under Shiite Rule","MENA","Like many Iraqis, Thawra Yousif Jacob has no job these days. But Ms. Jacob, a 43-year-old dancer and theater director, fears that with the empowerment of Shiite clerics in southern Iraq, she may not be able to resume her career. After Saddam Hussein's government fell, the three main theaters here were taken over by the three rival Shiite Muslim factions. The University of Basra, where Ms. Jacob taught drama, was closed after it was looted and badly damaged. ""Frankly, from March until now, the fall of Saddam was like a good dream,"" she said. ""But now the situation is like a nightmare. I do not know if I would be able to have my dancing classes or direct a play anymore."" Sixty percent of Iraqis are Shiite Muslims, and they are especially dominant in the south. Shiite clerics have quickly moved to assert themselves in southern cities and to seize power after 35 years of suppression by Mr. Hussein's Baath Party, which was dominated by Sunni Muslims. The Shiite clerics have moved quickly to constrain the freedom of women as a show of their authority. That has left many women in these southern cities, especially professionals like Ms. Jacob, wrestling with the losses and gains in the post-Hussein era. The cleric appointed to run the educational system in Basra, Ahmad al-Malek, declared that female teachers would not be allowed to receive their emergency salary payment if they appeared without a head scarf. Female students at the university said they were being harassed by followers of these Shiite clerics for not wearing head scarves, and many shops in the market have put up signs that read, ""My sister, cover your hair."" Ms. Jacob said she wore a head scarf when she went to get her payment and has begun wearing it when she goes to the market. ""But I refuse to wear it at university because I do not want them to impose it on me,"" she added. During most of the years when Mr. Hussein was in power, Iraqi women worked and studied with fewer restrictions than in neighboring Muslim countries, and they made up a large percentage of the professional class. They could vote, choose their own husbands and maintain custody of their children after a divorce. Iraq allowed women to inherit equally with their brothers. Women came under pressure in the 1990's, though, when Mr. Hussein began trying to please Islamic leaders. He barred women from traveling without a male relative, for example, unless they were going to work. Here in southern Iraq, years of suppression of the Shiites and poverty have eroded the middle class and led more people to turn to religion as a refuge or to use it as a tool for solidarity. Economic hardship has shaped the attitudes of many women here, leaving them less likely to give priority to their rights as women. In more conservative cities, like Najaf, the burial place of Ali, Muhammad's son-in-law and the founder of the Shiite branch of Islam, no woman is seen in public without an abaya, a head-to-toe black garment. Religious men are vocal in criticizing women, even foreign women, who do not wear an abaya there. Sundis Abdul Sadegh, a 26-year-old nurse in the city of Amara, 110 miles north of here, said her husband had allowed her to work only because her salary was more than his income as a shopkeeper. She said her family had ordered her not to speak to the British soldiers in the city. ""I listen to him because it is the order of religious men that it is forbidden for women to speak to foreigners,"" she said, wearing a gray head scarf. Muhammad Qassem Malek, a student at the University of Basra and a nephew of the man in charge of the educational system, explained the reason for such an order: ""There is a special softness to women's voices, and because of that they can speak flirtatiously. So it is better for them and society not to speak to American and British soldiers."" Mr. Malek, 28, added that in the mid-1990's, he became a follower of the teachings of Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Sadr, an influential Shiite leader who had been killed by Mr. Hussein. Ayatollah Sadr had made strong pronouncements about how women should dress, and Mr. Malek considers himself on a mission to make sure women observe his edicts. At the university he approaches women who are not wearing a head scarf, which is called a hijab. ""Sometimes they swear at me and tell me to get lost, but I see it as my religious obligation,"" he said. ""Some of them have listened and have become good Muslim women."" Ayatollah Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim, leader of the influential Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution, returned to Iraq early in May after 23 years of exile in Iran, and he invited all Shiites, including women, to take part in the development of the country. He said on the day he arrived here that women, especially educated and professional women, should not remain at home. Rather, he invited them to work and to contribute to the reconstruction of the country. But Ms. Jacob is not confident this will enable her to resume her career. Ayatollah Hakim's party is one of the groups that have taken over the theaters in Basra.",2003,"Iraq"

"219","Women Gather In Afghanistan To Compose A Bill of Rights","MENA","A few Afghan women and girls were released from jail for a day to attend a recent conference on women's rights in the new Afghan constitution, and their stories brought home the need for change in a country where 95 percentof women are illiterate. One of them, Eqlima, 16, said she had run away from her uncle's home in Kabul and had been picked up by the police in Kandahar. Brought to the conference, she fell into an exhausted sleep. When she awoke, she denounced the police for locking her up when she had committed no crime and vowed to escape as soon as she could. Rosia, 20, said she had fled her father-in-law's house after being forced to marry her brother-in-law after her husband's death. Then, she said, she was raped by her father-in-law and chained up and threatened with death, accused of killing a 2-year-old boy who had fallen down the family well. Mina, 30, said she had been kidnapped by a Taliban commander in Kabul seven years ago, along with her 2-year-old son, and sold to a man in Kandahar who had lost his arms in a mine accident. Kept as his captive wife for seven years, she had borne him four children and was pregnant with a fifth. She said she had run away to the police when the man's mother warned her that he was going to kill her. Their accounts could not be verified but did not surprise the Afghan women -- many of them lawyers, doctors, human rights specialists and civil society leaders -- gathered for four days to try to draw up a bill of women's rights for the new constitution. In their proposed bill, education for girls would be mandatory through secondary school, and women would have freedom of speech, freedom to vote and run for election, equal representation in Parliament and the judiciary, equal pay with men, and rights to financial independence and to own and inherit property. Many of those rights were entirely denied Afghan women under the six-year rule of the Taliban. Addressing the most difficult issues, the women called for criminal charges to be brought against men for domestic violence, sexual harassment and abuse, whether in public or at home. They demanded a ban on the practice of giving women or girls as compensation for crimes committed by one family against another. They called for a minimum marriageable age of 18 for girls (it is currently 16 but many girls marry in their early teens), for the right to marry and divorce in accordance with Islam, and for a reduction in time that women have to wait to remarry when their husbands disappear. Fatima Gailani, one of seven women on the commission that is drawing up the draft constitution, told the women later in Kabul: ""I am proud to say that what the women in Kandahar and other women have asked for, they are all in the constitution of Afghanistan. We were not alone in the commission, there were not just seven of us, we had you all there."" But as all the women at the Kandahar conference admitted, the law and the constitution are one thing on paper, and practices around the country, especially in the conservative tribal areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan, are quite another. Foreign diplomats are worried that change will be harder to carry out if Islamists succeed in making Shariah, or Islamic law, binding in the constitution when it is adopted at a loya jirga, or grand assembly, due in December. In 1964, Afghanistan adopted a Constitution that made the country more progressive than many of its neighbors. A civil code and family law drafted in 1976 also gave women some important rights. But the legal system has barely been functioning for three decades, laws and constitutions have often been ignored in Afghanistan and cultural mores remain stronger than the law in many places. ""The law is good, but it is not implemented because the government is not strong,"" said Suraya Parlika, who heads an Afghan women lawyers' association in Kabul. The greatest success of the conference in Kandahar, was the extra passenger who returned to Kabul with delegates from the capital. ""With lots of tears and pleas,"" said Sunita Mehta, co-founder of Women for Afghan Women, the conference organizers won the release of Eqlima, and were arranging a foster home and school for her to attend.",2003,"Afghanistan"
"220","Iranian Women Defy Authority to Protest Sex Discrimination","MENA","Hundreds of women staged an unauthorized demonstration in Tehran on Sunday, protesting sex discrimination under Iran's Islamic leadership just days before the June 17 presidential election. The protest was the first public display of dissent by women since the 1979 revolution, when the new leadership enforced obligatory veiling. ''We are women, we are the children of this land, but we have no rights,'' they chanted. More than 250 marched outside Tehran University, and about 200 others demonstrated two blocks away after hundreds of riot police officers prevented them from joining the main protest. There were reports that the police had clubbed several women, though there were no hospital reports of injuries. Demonstrators said they had seen some women being detained and dragged away by officers. But the situation appeared to stabilize, and after about an hour of demonstrating, the women disbanded without further incident. ''We will continue such protests because it shows that women are aware of their rights,'' said Roohi Afzal, 52, a translator who was at the protest. ''It seems that our presence today really hurts the government, that it has deployed so many forces. Maybe it will react and respond to our demands.'' The demonstrations were part of a recent push by women's rights advocates in Iran to draw attention to their cause during a time of relative tolerance by the government as it seeks to draw more voters to the polls. Iranian women have turned out in great numbers in elections over the past two decades, often strongly supporting candidates who have promised more rights. But many advocates now say that they have given up hope that any president could change their status under the current constitution. And women are signaling that they are tired of being courted with promises of improved status that are quickly forgotten once the election is over. The hard-line Guardian Council, dominated by six unelected clerics and six judges, last month rejected on the basis of their sex 89 women who had registered to run for president. The move was greeted with outrage, leading to at least one call for a boycott, though it was carefully worded. Zahra Eshraghi, the granddaughter of the leader of the 1979 Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said in an interview that working on women's issues has been very difficult because women did not feel safe to criticize the laws. ''There are certain things that are considered as crimes although the situation is gradually changing,'' she said. However, the more tolerant conditions that have appeared as the election nears have allowed women to express their criticism more than any time since the revolution. The mood was reflected in a meeting with a reformist candidate, Mostafa Moin, two weeks ago and another meeting last week. At the first meetings, Ms. Eshraghi said that candidates who promised to improve women's status must clarify how they could bring any changes as long as the country was ruled by Islamic law, or Shariah. Iranian law stipulates that the value of a woman's life or her testimony in court is half that of a man's. Iranian men can marry up to four wives and have the right to divorce any of them at will. A woman inherits half of the share of her brothers and needs her husband's permission to work outside the home or to leave the country. Women are rarely promoted to high positions, and despite their relatively high levels of education, they make up only 14 percent of government employees. Mahboobeh Abbasgholizadeh, a feminist who was jailed for a month last fall, apparently for her activities though no formal charges were announced, said, ''Women's rights will be fulfilled only when the constitution changes.'' A group of women activists forced their way into the Azadi Stadium to watch a soccer game between Iran and Bahrain on Wednesday for the first time since the Islamic revolution banned women from watching games at stadiums. They carried signs that read, ''My right is also human rights,'' and ''Freedom, justice and gender equality.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2005,"Iran"
"221","Some Fear Iraq's Charter Will Erode Women's Rights","MENA","Beneath a clackety ceiling fan in a dingy slate-gray room, Judge Esa al-Jubouri of the Karrada family court is about to pronounce Yasir and Isma man and wife. The ceremony, conducted as the families and friends of the bride and groom jam the cramped room behind them, is entirely a civil one, but when the judge squints through his thick glasses at the paperwork, he knows from the language governing the groom's wedding gift that Yasir and Isma are Shiites. As with all Muslim marriages in Iraq, the nuptial agreement is broadly consistent with Shariah, or Islamic religious law -- either the Sunni or Shiite version, depending on the couple's declared sect. And it is the delicate balance of this ceremony, a civil judge administering elements of Shariah, that some Iraqi women fear could be swept away by provisions written into a new draft constitution. Among the crucial articles that have appeared in various drafts of the constitution is this one: ''The followers of any sect or religion have the right to abide by their religion or sect in their personal affairs, and a law should organize this.'' By one interpretation, such provisions could create a series of religious courts with authority that would effectively supersede that of civil courts like this one and produce an Iranian-style theocracy. Each individual court, some women fear, would make rulings according to its whim, replacing the set judgments of the existing law -- even though those judgments are rooted in Shariah. ''It's really a huge setback,'' said Shirouk al-Abayachi, project manager of the Iraqi Women's Network, an umbrella organization of more than 80 women's groups that was founded in 2003. ''In a state of going forward,'' she said, referring to Iraq's budding democracy, ''we are going backward.'' The issue has prompted a series of recent protests and news conferences by the women's groups, including a meeting last Tuesday attended by the American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad. Generally loath to interfere openly with the Iraqi political process, American officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Mr. Khalilzad, have insisted that the new constitution protect women's rights. But the ramifications of the ambiguously worded provisions are not yet certain. Current Iraqi law coexists with Shariah and Christian church rulings in a thick undergrowth of judicial institutions and precedents that some legal specialists here say is unlikely to be changed much. ''I don't see any significant difference with the new constitution,'' said Jaafar Nasser Hussain, a Shiite member of the Supreme Court who received his first appointment as a judge in 1976 and served for a time in a family court in Diyala Province, east of Baghdad. Basic differences among Shiite, Sunni and Christian religious doctrine are reflected in the law, Mr. Hussain said. For example, Isma, the bride -- the judge would not let her and the groom give their last names for publication -- is entitled to half her wedding gift before the marriage ceremony and half afterward, whenever she asks for it, because she is a Shiite. A Sunni bride could request the second payment, in this case five million dinars, or about $3,400, only on the death of her husband or after a divorce. ''Yes, I got the sum,'' Isma told the judge when he asked if the first payment had been made. ''I pronounce you husband and wife according to the agreement between you,'' the judge said. The women in the group behind them broke into the jarringly high-pitched ''La la la la la la la!'' of Muslim celebrations and threw candy that landed with a thunk on the judge's desk. He indulgently scooped it up and put it into plastic bags kept on his desk for that purpose. This family court uses laws put together from some of the more liberal elements of Shariah in 1959, said Hanaa Edwar, secretary of the Iraqi Women's Network. State religious courts existed to help administer the law until it was further liberalized in the late 1970's, Ms. Edwar said. The family law ''is based on Shariah,'' she said. But because the rules have been unified in civil statutes to be administered by the state, Ms. Edwar said, ''there is one court.'' ''So it means the state law is going to be judged by the state,'' rather than by an unpredictable collection of separate religious courts, she said. ''This is very essential for us.'' A Muslim woman has a limited ability to initiate a divorce; she may, for example, claim that her husband is impotent or has abused her. But a man may simply say ''I am divorced'' three times to his wife to start the legal process. Between two of his rapid-fire marriage ceremonies, Mr. Jubouri asked one man who wanted a divorce if he had said the crucial phrase three times. Standing with his lawyer, the man assured the judge that he had. Afterward, Mr. Jubouri gruffly explained that the rulings on such routine matters had been clearly written into civil law. ''This is an official court, and we are the ones who take care of such things,'' he said. ''So there is no need for any mosque.'' But judges do appeal to religious authorities when the rulings are not as clear. In one case during his time on the family court, said Mr. Nasser, the Supreme Court justice, a Christian woman came to him asking for a divorce from a husband who had become mentally ill. As a Muslim, he was not sure whether a Christian church would allow the women to ask for a divorce in such a case. So Mr. Nasser sent for a ruling from the women's church: she was a Catholic, as it happened, and no divorce was allowed. ''In a case like this, we don't issue an order on our own convictions,'' Mr. Nasser said. Various drafts of the constitution that have been floated contain half a dozen provisions that women's rights groups and other human rights groups have found worrisome. One declares Islam to be ''the main source'' of legislation in the country. Another states that the country should ''preserve the noble values of the tribes, which coincide with Shariah.'' The exact wording shifts from draft to draft. Of greatest concern to the women's groups, though, is an article in a draft of Chapter2, which covers human rights, that was handed out last week at a news conference led by Sheik Humam Hamoudi, chairman of the constitutional committee. That is the article that would guarantee the followers of any particular sect the freedom to abide, essentially, by their own family laws. Ms. Edwar said the provision could effectively oblige women to become subject to the narrow religious rulings of whichever cleric happens to be in charge of her local sect. ''This will be really very forceful for the women to be under the man,'' she said, speaking in English. With four main Sunni sects and countless Shiite sects and subsects, each with slightly different rulings, ''there will be chaos,'' said Amal al-Qadi, a Sunni who is a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party. And in that chaos, she contends, religious courts and the male heads of families will end up making rulings affecting women that now fall to the civil courts. ''We always lose our rights in religious courts,'' Ms. Qadi said. Mr. Hamoudi, a sheik himself, denied that the language would extend religious control over civil affairs. ''There isn't anything in the constitution to impose religious teachings or religious laws in Iraq,'' he said. What seems likely is that nearly a half-century's tradition of intermingling civil and religious affairs will be hard to undo overnight. A framed Koranic verse hanging on the gray wall behind Mr. Jubouri seemed to be keeping watch on his work. ''If you judge between people,'' the verse admonished, ''judge fairly.''

Hughes that they are happy with the status quo, it is disappointing that so little attention was given to the many Saudi women who ardently favor women's rights to vote and to drive. These women are advocating for ideals of justice and equality that are neither American nor Middle Eastern in nature; they are universal human rights deserving of protection from governments and inherent to all women and men, regardless of the national boundaries in which they live.

"223","New Iraqi Constitution May Curb Women's Rights","MENA","A working draft of Iraq's new constitution would cede a strong role to Islamic law and could sharply curb women's rights, particularly in personal matters like divorce and family inheritance. The document's writers are also debating whether to drop or phase out a measure enshrined in the interim constitution, co-written last year by the Americans, requiring that women make up at least a quarter of the parliament. The draft of a chapter of the new constitution obtained by The New York Times on Tuesday guarantees equal rights for women as long as those rights do not ''violate Shariah,'' or Koranic law. The Americans and secular Iraqis banished such explicit references to religious law from the interim constitution adopted early last year. The draft chapter, circulated discreetly in recent days, has ignited outrage among women's groups, which held a protest on Tuesday morning in downtown Baghdad at the square where a statue of Saddam Hussein was pulled down by American marines in April 2003. One of the critical passages is in Article 14 of the chapter, a sweeping measure that would require court cases dealing with matters like marriage, divorce and inheritance to be judged according to the law practiced by the family's sect or religion. Under that measure, Shiite women in Iraq, no matter what their age, generally could not marry without their families' permission. Under some interpretations of Shariah, men could attain a divorce simply by stating their intention three times in their wives' presence. Article 14 would replace a body of Iraqi law that has for decades been considered one of the most progressive in the Middle East in protecting the rights of women, giving them the freedom to choose a husband and requiring divorce cases to be decided by a judge. If adopted, the shift away from the more secular and egalitarian provisions of the interim constitution would be a major victory for Shiite clerics and religious politicians, who chafed at the Americans' insistence that Islam be designated in the interim constitution as just ''a source'' of legislation. Several writers of the new constitution say they intend, at the very least, to designate Islam as ''a main source'' of legislation. By rough count, nearly 200 women and men showed up in the fiery heat to hand out fliers and wave white banners in a throng of traffic. ''We want to be equal to everybody -- we want human rights for everybody,'' read one slogan. The demonstration came hours before two Sunni Arabs involved in writing the constitution were fatally shot near a Baghdad restaurant, threatening to throw the drafting process into turmoil. ''We want a guarantee of women's rights in the new constitution,'' said Hannah Edwar, an organizer of the protest. ''We're going to meet with the constitutional committee and make our thoughts known.'' A dozen women, some sheathed in full-length black robes, showed up to denounce Ms. Edwar's protest. They said they were followers of Moktada al-Sadr, the fundamentalist Shiite cleric who has led two rebellions against the Americans. American and Iraqi officials say that several draft chapters of the constitution are floating around Baghdad and that no final language has been agreed on. Changes can still be made before Aug. 15, the deadline for the National Assembly to approve a draft. Protests by women and relatively secular blocs on the constitutional committee, like the Kurds, may force Shiite members to tone down the religious language. ''Some of the points regarding women's rights in this chapter are still to be reviewed,'' said Mariam Arayess, a religious Shiite on the committee. Ms. Arayess said she believed that the draft was the most recent working version, and that it had fairly generous provisions for equal rights. She is one of fewer than 10 women on the 71-member drafting committee. The chapter has 27 articles, most of which have relatively liberal provisions aimed at ensuring various civil rights. The first says that ''all Iraqis are equal before the law'' and that ''equal opportunities are guaranteed for all citizens according to the law.'' The final article forbids censorship of the press. References to Islam and Shariah appear in a few places. One clause says Iraqis will enjoy all rights stated in ''international treaties and conventions as long as they do not contradict Islam.'' Such language is accepted by many Iraqis, including moderates, who say Islam is a vital foundation for the country. But women's groups are incensed by Article 14, which would repeal a relatively liberal personal status law enacted in 1959 after the British-backed monarchy was overthrown by secular military officers. That law remained in effect through the decades of Mr. Hussein's rule. The law used Shariah to adjudicate personal and family matters, but did it in as secular a manner as possible, pulling together the most liberal interpretations of Koranic law from the main Shiite and Sunni sects and stitching them together into one code. Critics of the draft proposal say that in addition to restricting women's rights, it could also deepen the sectarian divide between Sunnis and Shiites. The draft also does not make clear what would happen in cases where the husband is from one sect and the wife from another. Religious Shiite politicians tried once before, in December 2003, to abolish the 1959 law. As is happening now, women's groups and secular female politicians took to the streets. Faced with the mini-rebellion, L. Paul Bremer III, then the effective American proconsul of Iraq, rebuffed the move, to the anger and dismay of many religious Shiites. ''We don't want to use separate Sunni or Shiite laws,'' said Dohar Rouhi, president of the Association of Women Entrepreneurs. ''We want a law that can be applied to everyone. We want justice for women.'' A Westerner familiar with the writing of the constitution said that when he saw a draft of the civil rights section less than a week ago, it did not contain the sweeping language on personal status law. In that version, he said, most measures -- even those citing Shariah -- were not as severe as they could have been. ''Compared to what some of the conservative Shiites were pushing, the glass is half full,'' said the Westerner, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, because he did not want to appear to be interfering in a sovereign Iraqi process. He said there was some cause for alarm, though, pointing to a proposal to phase out a measure in the interim constitution requiring that a quarter of parliamentary seats go to women. Ms. Arayess, the Shiite drafter, said some of the writers were considering keeping the quota for the next two terms of the parliament before allowing it to lapse. After that, she said, women should be able to stand on their own.",2005,"Iraq"
"224","SECULAR IRAQIS SAY NEW CHARTER MAY CURB RIGHTS","MENA","Some secular Iraqi leaders complained Tuesday that the country's nearly finished constitution lays the groundwork for the possible domination of the country by Shiite Islamic clerics, and that it contains specific provisions that could sharply curtail the rights of women. The secular leaders said the draft, which was presented to the National Assembly on Monday, contains language that not only establishes the primacy of Islam as the country's official religion, but appears to grant judges wide latitude to strike down legislation that may contravene the faith. To interpret such legislation, the constitution calls for the appointment of experts in Shariah, or Islamic law, to preside on the Supreme Federal Court. The draft constitution, these secular Iraqis say, clears the way for religious authorities to adjudicate personal disputes like divorce and inheritance matters by allowing the establishment of religious courts, raising fears that a popularly elected Islamist-minded government could enact legislation and appoint judges who could turn the country into a theocracy. The courts would rely on Shariah, which under most interpretations grants women substantially fewer rights than men. Language reserving a quarter of the Assembly's seats for women has been relegated to a section of the constitution labeled transitional, which is of uncertain legal force and duration. Another phrase declares that education is mandatory only through elementary school. Women's rights groups, which expressed concern about lower levels of literacy among women here, wanted middle school to be declared mandatory as well, but were defeated. President Bush, in an appearance in Idaho on Tuesday, asserted that the Iraqi document guaranteed women's rights and the freedom of religion in a country that in recent decades had only known dictatorship. Labeling the Iraqi constitution an ''amazing event,'' he said, ''We had a little trouble with our own conventions writing a constitution.'' The Iraqi constitution, several weeks in the making, is still not in its final form. After weeks of deliberations and an extension of its deadline, a group of Iraqi leaders submitted an incomplete draft to the Assembly on Monday night. The leaders gave themselves until Thursday to work out the remaining disputes. According to Shiite and Kurdish leaders, who wrote most of the document, none of those differences involved questions of Islam or women's rights. Many Iraqis say they are already concerned at the strengthening grip of political Islam in many areas of southern Iraq, where alcohol is banned in many places, women are forced to dress conservatively and religious minorities often feel compelled to mimic those in the majority. Most of the cities of southern Iraq have fallen under the sway of the same Shiite political parties that make up the ruling coalition in Baghdad, one that many people believe has a good chance at capturing a majority of Assembly seats in the elections scheduled for December. ''This is the future of the new Iraqi government -- it will be in the hands of the clerics,'' said Dr. Raja Kuzai, a secular Shiite member of the Assembly. ''I wanted Iraqi women to be free, to be able to talk freely and to able to move around.'' ''I am not going to stay here,'' said Dr. Kuzai, an obstetrician and women's leader who met President Bush in the White House in November 2003. Other Iraqi leaders who helped draft the constitution say the fears of nascent theocracy are unfounded. The new draft constitution, they point out, contains language guaranteeing equal rights for all Iraqis, as well as freedom of expression and religion. And it contains important safeguards, such as, in some cases, the requirement of super-majorities to approve laws. Ahmad Chalabi, the deputy prime minister, said the Iraqi draft constitution erected a more stringent separation of state and religion than any such document in the Middle East. Mr. Chalabi said the new language allowing a clerical role in family disputes was inserted by popular demand, and that, in any case, any Iraqi would be free to reject it and opt for a secular court. ''There is no compulsion; they are free to do whatever they want,'' said Mr. Chalabi, the former White House favorite who has recently moved closer to Islamist politicians like Moktada al-Sadr. ''There was much discontent among people because they were forced to follow laws they didn't believe in.'' Asked about the possibility of a theocratic government in Iraq, the American ambassador here, Zalmay Khalilzad, argued that the document strives for a balance of authority among Islam, human rights and democracy. ''The draft contains far-reaching democratic and human rights commitments,'' he said during a news conference. ''It's a synthesis between Islamic traditions of the country with the universal principles of democracy and human rights, and in that sense, it sets a new path for the future.'' The Shiite and Kurdish leaders who bear primary responsibility for drafting the document have given public assurances that the new constitution would protect individual rights, and that they have built safeguards into the draft to ensure that Iraq will not become theocracy. Mr. Khalilzad acknowledged the limits of American influence here, saying it was not the intention of the Bush administration to impose what would amount to a Western constitution on a country with a different history and tradition. ''These are decisions that Iraqis have made for themselves,'' he said. ''We don't want to impose on Iraq a cookie-cutter approach. That's not American foreign policy.'' But some secular-minded Iraqis criticized American diplomats for not working harder to block efforts by Shiite politicians, many of whom are clerics, to expand the reach of Islam. Mahmood Othman, a Kurdish legislator, said Kurdish leaders did not vigorously oppose Islamist language in part because American diplomats often did not object either. For instance, Mr. Othman said, American diplomats had acquiesced to the language that would clear the way for clerical adjudication of family and personal disputes. ''The Kurds thought, as long as the Americans don't object, why should we object?'' Mr. Othman said. ''It's American policy to show that it is not opposed to Islam.'' In his Idaho appearance, Mr. Bush said he was optimistic despite a prediction by the negotiator for the Sunni Muslim minority that the country would ''rise in the streets'' if the constitution, as currently written, is approved. ''You know, you're speaking about one voice,'' the president told a small group of reporters at the Tamarack resort near Donnelly, Idaho. ''There is more than one Sunni involved in the process. Reaching an accord on a constitution, after years of dictatorship, is not easy. And so you're seeing people express their opinion. '' The Sunnis, Mr. Bush added, ''have got to make a choice: do they want to live in a society that's free, or do they want to live in violence?'' Shiite and Kurdish leaders who drafted most of the document say they will try to find an agreement on language with the Sunnis, whose main objection is the demand by Shiite leaders for a large autonomous region in the south. Secular Iraqi leaders say there are three areas in the constitution that worry them. While they say the constitution would change nothing by itself, they worry about the language establishing Islam as the official religion of the state and as ''a primary source of legislation.'' The constitution then says there can be no law that contradicts the ''basic beliefs of Islam.'' Some Iraqis fear that the phrase is so broad as to allow Iraqi judges wide latitude in striking down secular legislation. Some said they had preferred a phrase saying that no law could contradict the ''agreed upon'' principles of Islam, which they say would have substantially narrowed the sort of legislation that could be struck down. In addition, some Iraqis are concerned about language that would allow experts in ''Shariah law'' to sit on the Iraqi Supreme Federal Court. Some worried that such experts would inevitably be clerics. The clause does not answer such crucial questions as how many such experts would sit on the court or how they would be appointed. Instead, it calls for a law to be written by a future elected body. As a safeguard against a possibly overweening majority, the constitution states that the law must be approved by a two-thirds majority. ''What this means is that, before we pass a law, we're going to have to run it past a Shariah law expert,'' said Wael Abdul Latif, a Shiite judge and member of the constitutional drafting committee. ''I'm upset. Very.'' The other section prompting worry is one that deals with ''personal law,'' governing affairs like marriage, divorce and inheritance. The new constitution declares that ''Iraqis are free to abide in their personal lives according to their religions, sects or beliefs.'' And it calls for a law to set up a system to deal with such matters. Many Iraqi leaders, including those who took part in the negotiations over that phrase, said the language would clear the way for the Assembly to set up religious courts to regulate such matters. Secular Iraqi leaders fear that the Iraqi law governing family relations that is currently on the books, passed in 1959, will be abolished, and that Shariah law will dominate the lives of ordinary Iraqis. ''It sounds like the civil law will be canceled,'' Dr. Kuzai said. ''We had the best family law in the Middle East. And we'll go back to the clerics.'' Some secular-minded Iraqis believe the constitution is less important than political battles to come. Adnan Pachachi, a former foreign minister, said that if secular Sunni and Shiite leaders bind together with the Kurds, they might, after the next election, constitute a majority of the Assembly. As such, they could successfully block the imposition of an Islamic state. ''Iraqis of all faiths, confessions and otherwise, are free to conduct family issues according to their beliefs.'' Some secular Iraqis fear that the draft constitution, as written, would allow for the creation of religious courts that could erode women's rights and even pave the way for an Islamic theocracy.

"225","On the Air, on Their Own: Iraqi Women Find a Forum","MENA","The two radio hosts, Majda and Majid, a chattering woman-and-man team, said the subject for the next hour would be childbearing and motherhood, from the first flush of pregnancy to the tribulations of labor. So Majda opened the show with a poem, dedicating it to the ''mother of Baghdad'': ''You are my darling, you are the flower of my table, you are my drink.'' Then the talk turned as heated as an Iraqi summer. ''Most of our operating rooms for giving birth aren't clean,'' Majid said. ''It's not healthy,'' Majda said. ''There are no standards of cleanliness in these hospitals.'' Majid said: ''How can we receive the baby, a flower, a gift, in a dirty place? If the baby is born in an unhealthy place, the mother also won't be healthy.'' The rest of the recent talk show, called ''Cup of Tea,'' went much like that, with the two hosts trading barbed insights. The station broadcasting it, Radio Al Mahaba, on 96 FM here in central Iraq, could well be the only one in the Arab world devoted to women's issues, its founders say. Started with United Nations financing by an American woman and an Iraqi refugee from western New York, it falls between National Public Radio and ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' The station broadcasts programs about marriage, divorce, careers, religion, the constitution, physical abuse and dress codes, all from the perspective of women. The shows are especially sharp-edged in a country where Shiite militiamen in the south harass women without head scarves and religious leaders in Baghdad have pushed for a greater role for Islam -- and, consequently, a potential rollback of women's rights -- in the new constitution. ''We want to affirm women's rights,'' said Ruwaida Kamal, 30, a producer at the station. ''We're in a dangerous period. There are many movements, many groups that aren't taking women's rights seriously. Women are being marginalized.'' With its slogan ''The Voice of Iraqi Woman,'' Radio Al Mahaba is an example of how, amid the cacophony of violence, the American experiment has prompted some Iraqis to try to build an open, democratic civil society. With newspapers, radio networks and satellite television channels popping up, the media are flourishing in ways they were never permitted to under Saddam Hussein. The aim of Radio Al Mahaba is aligned with one of the Bush administration's main goals in Iraq -- to spread secular, American-style interpretations of equality and justice in the Middle East. Whether the station will succeed is far from certain, given the rise of fundamentalism here. But its 33 workers, half of them women, remain optimistic. ''This is unique in the Middle East and all the Arab nations,'' said the station's director, Ali Abbas Hamoudi. ''Now that we're facing a new government, a new nation, we're trying to help expose the voice of the Iraqi woman to the new officials.'' Radio Al Mahaba, which means ''love'' in Arabic, went on the air on April 1 with four hours of programming and now broadcasts from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. It has a 120-mile reach from central Baghdad, though there is no measure of how many people listen. Sprinkled among talk shows are blocks of Middle Eastern and Western music, including the Lebanese singer Fairuz, Mariah Carey and Kurdish folk singers. The station is in an office building overlooking Firdos Square, where American marines and Iraqis toppled a statue of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003, signaling the fall of Baghdad. It has the rough-and-tumble feel of a college radio station, with a small recording studio, a kitchen alcove and cramped offices. Black-and-white photographs of famous female Iraqi singers from decades ago hang on the walls of the main hallway above the faded brown carpeting. The women here do not wear head scarves, a sight rare enough these days to elicit a gasp of delight from a visiting female interpreter. On a recent afternoon, a Kurdish producer spliced together a debate show, ''Two Viewpoints, One Issue,'' while a Jennifer Lopez song was played on the air. Across the hall, Ms. Kamal edited an interview for a weekly show called ''Details About Women.'' ''This story is about disabled women,'' Ms. Kamal said, sunglasses perched atop her head, earphones around her neck. ''This woman is paralyzed; she can't walk because she was shot in her back. She was 4 years old when this happened, during the Iraq-Iran war in 1982. She's in a wheelchair, but she's also a sportswoman, a tennis player.'' Radio Al Mahaba was founded by Deborah Bowers, an American from the Buffalo area, and Kamal Jabar, an Iraqi refugee whom Ms. Bowers met in upstate New York in 1992. Ms. Bowers became intensely interested in Iraq after befriending Mr. Jabar, and the two traveled to Iraq after the American-led invasion. Mr. Jabar proposed the idea of the radio station. Ms. Bowers applied for a grant from the United Nations Development Fund for Women and got approval in January 2005 for $500,000. ''We saw radio as an educational tool; there would be programming that would empower women to be part of the rebuilding of civil society and to encourage women to think about democracy,'' Ms. Bowers said in a telephone interview. ''A lot of it is just the freedom to voice opinions or hear other opinions.'' Because of relatively low literacy among Iraqi women -- about 24 percent in a 2003 estimate -- she saw radio as the best way to spread the feminist message. Ms. Bowers said her group had received $350,000 of the United Nations grant. The United States Institute for Peace, a research group created by Congress, recently agreed to give some financing for more programs on the Iraqi constitution. Ms. Bowers declined to give the exact figure because she said highlighting American support could endanger the station and its employees. Majda al-Jubouri, 41, who is the host of ''Cup of Tea'' along with Majid Hussein, exemplifies the type of progressive woman the station promotes. Ms. Jubouri grew up on a farm south of Baghdad. Her family belonged to the Communist Party, she said, and she was imprisoned for five years at age 14. She worked on the farm until after the fall of the old government, when she moved to Baghdad with her boyfriend, a journalist for a Communist newspaper. She also began writing for the paper. They married last year. Then came Radio Al Mahaba. ''Because of war since the 1980's, Iraqi people have been slipping backward, and now it's getting worse,'' she said.

"226","Muslim Women Don't See Themselves as Oppressed, Survey Finds","MENA","Muslim women do not think they are conditioned to accept second-class status or view themselves as oppressed, according to a survey released Tuesday by The Gallup Organization. According to the poll, conducted in 2005, a strong majority of Muslim women believe they should have the right to vote without influence, work outside the home and serve in the highest levels of government. In more than 8,000 face-to-face interviews conducted in eight predominantly Muslim countries, the survey found that many women in the Muslim world did not see sex issues as a priority because other issues were more pressing. When asked what they resented most about their own societies, a majority of Muslim women polled said that a lack of unity among Muslim nations, violent extremism, and political and economic corruption were their main concerns. The hijab, or head scarf, and burqa, the garment covering face and body, seen by some Westerners as tools of oppression, were never mentioned in the women's answers to the open-ended questions, the poll analysts said. Concerning women's rights in general, most Muslim women polled associated sex equality with the West. Seventy-eight percent of Moroccan women, 71 percent of Lebanese women and 48 percent of Saudi women polled linked legal equality with the West. Still, a majority of the respondents did not think adopting Western values would help the Muslim world's political and economic progress. The most frequent response to the question, ''What do you admire least about the West?'' was the general perception of moral decay, promiscuity and pornography that pollsters called the ''Hollywood image'' that is regarded as degrading to women. An overwhelming majority of the women polled in each country cited ''attachment to moral and spiritual values'' as the best aspect of their own societies. In Pakistan, 53 percent of the women polled said attachment to their religious beliefs was their country's most admirable trait. Similarly, in Egypt, 59 percent of the women surveyed cited love of their religion as the best aspect. At 97 percent, Lebanon had the highest percentage of women who said they believed they should be able to make their own voting decisions, followed by Egypt and Morocco at 95 percent. Pakistan was lowest, at 68 percent. The survey, ''What Women Want: Listening to the Voices of Muslim Women,'' is a part of The Gallup World Poll, which plans to survey 95 percent of the earth's population over the next century. Dalia Mogahed, the strategic analyst of Muslim studies at The Gallup World Poll, said the new data provide fresh insight into the Muslim world, where Western perceptions generally cast women as victims. ''Women's empowerment has been identified as a key goal of U.S. policy in the region,'' said Ms. Mogahed, adding that Muslim women's rights have generated a lot of interest without much empirical information on ''what Muslim women want.'' Ms. Mogahed, who was born in Egypt and wears a Islamic head scarf, rejected the idea that Muslim women had been brainwashed by the dominant male culture, citing as proof the fact that women freely stated that they deserved certain rights. ''In every culture there is a dominant narrative, and in many cases it is constructed by people in power who happen to be men,'' Ms. Mogahed said.",2006,"Morocco"
"227","Iran Lifts Rule Barring Women From Attending Sporting Events","MENA","Women can attend games in Iran's stadiums for the first time in nearly three decades, after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unexpectedly lifted a ban last week on their presence in the stands. Senior clerics and conservative members of Parliament criticized the decision and said that frequent hooliganism at sporting events made them inappropriate for women. But Mr. Ahmadinejad said women would promote better behavior. ''Certain prejudices against women have nothing to do with Islam,'' he said Friday, several days after lifting the ban. The speech seemed to present him for the first time as a supporter of expanded rights for women. ''Unfortunately, whenever there is talk of social corruption, fingers are pointed at women. Shouldn't men be blamed for the problems, too?'' Soccer matches are the most popular sporting events in Iran. Women had been demanding the right to attend games for more than a decade, but officials, including the former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, denied their requests. A strict dress code for women and segregation of the sexes has been enforced since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Mr. Ahmadinejad has specified that the best seats in stadiums be allocated to women and families to adhere to the segregation code. Women and men will still be seated in separate areas. ''I respect him for this move,'' said Siamak Namazi, a political analyst at Atieh Bahar Consulting. ''It was a gutsy move because he can lose some of his conservative supporters who voted for him,'' he added. Advocates of greater rights for women welcomed his decision, although they acknowledged that the move was also a way to increase his popularity among women at a time when he needs to bolster his support inside the country. ''Even if the pressure by clerics in Qum forces Mr. Ahmadinejad to back down, his decision will always be considered as a winning card for him,'' Shadi Sadr, a lawyer and a feminist, wrote Saturday in the daily reformist newspaper Shargh.",2006,"Iran"
"228","World Briefing  Middle East: Saudi Arabia: King Warns Newspapers Over Photos Of Women","MENA","  King Abdullah has told Saudi editors to stop publishing photographs of women because they could lead young men ''astray,'' newspapers reported. The king's directive, made in a meeting with local editors, caused surprise because he has been regarded as a quiet reformer since he took office last August. In recent months, newspapers have published pictures of women -- always wearing the traditional Muslim head scarf -- to illustrate articles, usually about women's issues. The papers have also started publishing a range of views on causes that are not generally accepted in Saudi Arabia, such as women having the right to drive and vote.",2006,"Saudi Arabia"
"229","A Quiet Revolution in Algeria: Gains by Women","MENA","In this tradition-bound nation scarred by a brutal Islamist-led civil war that killed more than 100,000, a quiet revolution is under way: women are emerging as an economic and political force unheard of in the rest of the Arab world. Women make up 70 percent of Algeria's lawyers and 60 percent of its judges. Women dominate medicine. Increasingly, women contribute more to household income than men. Sixty percent of university students are women, university researchers say. In a region where women have a decidedly low public profile, Algerian women are visible everywhere. They are starting to drive buses and taxicabs. They pump gas and wait on tables. Although men still hold all of the formal levers of power and women still make up only 20 percent of the work force, that is more than twice their share a generation ago, and they seem to be taking over the machinery of state as well. ''If such a trend continues,'' said Daho Djerbal, editor and publisher of Naqd, a magazine of social criticism and analysis, ''we will see a new phenomenon where our public administration will also be controlled by women.'' The change seems to have sneaked up on Algerians, who for years have focused more on the struggle between a governing party trying to stay in power and Islamists trying to take that power. Those who study the region say they are taken aback by the data but suggest that an explanation may lie in the educational system and the labor market. University studies are no longer viewed as a credible route toward a career or economic well-being, and so men may well opt out and try to find work or to simply leave the country, suggested Hugh Roberts, a historian and the North Africa project director of the International Crisis Group. But for women, he added, university studies get them out of the house and allow them to position themselves better in society. ''The dividend may be social rather than in terms of career,'' he said. This generation of Algerian women has navigated a path between the secular state and the pull of extremist Islam, the two poles of the national crisis of recent years. The women are more religious than previous generations, and more modern, sociologists here said. Women cover their heads and drape their bodies with traditional Islamic coverings. They pray. They go to the mosque -- and they work, often alongside men, once considered taboo. Sociologists and many working women say that by adopting religion and wearing the Islamic head covering called the hijab, women here have in effect freed themselves from moral judgments and restrictions imposed by men. Uncovered women are rarely seen on the street late at night, but covered women can be seen strolling the city after attending the evening prayer at a mosque. ''They never criticize me, especially when they see I am wearing the hijab,'' said Denni Fatiha, 44, the first woman to drive a large city bus through the narrow, winding roads of Algiers. The impact has been far-reaching and profound. In some neighborhoods, for example, birthrates appear to have fallen and class sizes in elementary schools have dropped by nearly half. It appears that women are delaying marriage to complete their studies, though delayed marriage is also a function of high unemployment. In the past, women typically married at 17 or 18 but now marry on average at 29, sociologists said. And when they marry, it is often to men who are far less educated, creating an awkward social reality for many women. Khalida Rahman is a lawyer. She is 33 and has been married to a night watchman for five months. Her husband was a friend of her brothers who showed up one day and proposed. She immediately said yes, she recalled. She describes her life now this way: ''Whenever I leave him it is just as if I am a man. But when I get home I become a woman.'' Fatima Oussedik, a sociologist, said, ''We in the '60s, we were progressive, but we did not achieve what is being achieved by this generation today.'' Ms. Oussedik, who works for the Research Center for Applied Economics and Development in Algiers, does not wear the hijab and prefers to speak in French. Researchers here say the change is not driven by demographics; women make up only a bit more than half of the population. They said it is driven by desire and opportunity. Algeria's young men reject school and try to earn money as traders in the informal sector, selling goods on the street, or they focus their efforts on leaving the country or just hanging out. There is a whole class of young men referred to as hittistes -- the word is a combination of French and Arabic for people who hold up walls. Increasingly, the people here have lost faith in their government, which draws its legitimacy from a revolution now more than five decades old, many political and social analysts said. In recent parliamentary elections, turnout was low and there were 970,000 protest votes -- cast by people who intentionally destroyed their ballots -- nearly as many as the 1.3 million votes cast in support of the governing party. There are regular protests, and riots, all over the country, with people complaining about corruption, lack of services and economic disparities. There are violent attacks, too: bombings aimed at the police, officials and foreigners. A triple suicide bombing on April 11 against the prime minister's office and the police left more than 30 people dead. In that context, women may have emerged as Algeria's most potent force for social change, with their presence in the bureaucracy and on the street having a potentially moderating and modernizing influence on society, sociologists said. ''Women, and the women's movement, could be leading us to modernity,'' said Abdel Nasser Djabi, a professor of sociology at the University of Algiers. Not everyone is happy with those dynamics. Some political and social analysts say the recent resurgence in radical Islamist activity, including bombings, is driven partly by a desire to slow the social change the country is experiencing, especially regarding women's role in society. Others complain that the growing participation of women in society is a direct violation of the faith. ''I am against this,'' said Esmail Ben Ibrahim, an imam at a neighborhood mosque near the center of the city. ''It is all wrong from a religious point of view. Society has embarked on the wrong path.'' The quest for identity is a constant undercurrent in much of the Middle East. But it is arguably the most complicated question in Algeria, a nation whose borders were drawn by France and whose people speak Berber, Arabic and French. After a bitter experience with French occupation and a seven-year revolutionary war that brought independence in 1962 at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives, the leaders here chose to adopt Islam and Arab identity as the force to unify the country. Arabic replaced French as the language of education, and the French secular curriculum was replaced with a curriculum heavy on religion. At the same time, girls were encouraged to go to school. Now, more than four decades later, Algeria's youth -- 70 percent of the population is under 30, researchers said -- have grown up with Arabic and an orientation toward Middle Eastern issues. Arabic-language television networks like Al Jazeera have become the popular reference point, more so than French television, observers here said. In the 1990s radical Islamist ideas gained popular support, and terrorism was widely accepted as a means to win power. More than 100,000 people died in years of civil conflict. Today most people say the experience has forced them to reject the most radical ideas. So although Algerians are more religious now than they were during the bloody 1990s, they are more likely to embrace modernity -- a partial explanation for the emergence of women as a societal force, some analysts said. That is not the case in more rural mountainous areas, where women continue to live by the code of tradition. But for the time being, most people say that for now the community's collective consciousness is simply too raw from the years of civil war for Islamist terrorists or radical Islamic ideas to gain popular support. There is a sense that the new room given to women may at least partly be a reflection of that general feeling. The population has largely rejected the most radical interpretation of Islam and has begun to return to the more North African, almost mystical, interpretation of the faith, sociologists and religious leaders said. Whatever the underlying reason, women in the streets of the city are brimming with enthusiasm. ''I don't think any of this contradicts Islam,'' said Wahiba Nabti, 36, as she walked through the center of the city one day recently. ''On the contrary, Islam gives freedom to work. Anyway, it is between you and God.'' Ms. Nabti wore a black scarf covering her head and a long black gown that hid the shape of her body. ''I hope one day I can drive a crane, so I can really be financially independent,'' she said. ''You cannot always rely on a man.''",2007,"Algeria"

Under the Islamic legal system imposed after Iran's 1979 revolution, unrelated men and women are forbidden to have intimate contact. However, this is not generally taken to include activities like banking or shopping, and women do commonly use banks where they may be served by someone of either sex.",2010,"Iran"
"231","Just Drive, She Said","MENA","Two Saudi activists get into a car .... Wajiha Howeidar: Today there was a report in the Al-Riyadh newspaper. A sister took her brother to the hospital in her car. Manal al-Sharif: Yes. No punchline there. A video of a person driving a car and talking shouldn't be very interesting, but this one, below, from which the above exchange was translated, first posted on May 21, has attracted hundreds of thousands of views, sparked a women's rights campaign in Saudi Arabia (where women are prohibited from driving) and has become a sort of viral rallying point for human rights proponents both inside and outside the kingdom. It also landed the activist-driver, the 32-year-old Manal al-Sharif, in detention for more than a week. She has since been released, but her movement encouraging Saudi women to drive continues, with a social media campaign and protest-drive date of June 17. (Robert Mackey at The Lede has a good summary of recent events.) At Okaz, an Arabic daily, Khalaf al-Harbi distilled the essence of a situation that seemed like something out of a Beckett play. He wrote (translated by ArabNews.com): No other society in the world has encountered a similar situation because of the problem's simplicity. After putting the cart before the horse over the past many decades, we now do not know how to put the horse at its rightful place so that we can ride at a normal pace. We solved our problem by recruiting peasants from poor countries, who knew nothing about cars, to work here as drivers. The result is that even women carrying doctoral degrees are forced to hire uneducated peasant laborers. Our attempts to solve the problem - while we are scared of a final decision - have left us in a situation comparable to a scene in some absurd drama. We behave like a man endlessly going round a post believing that he has traveled a long distance. But plenty of less literary positions were taken throughout the kingdom. For those a bit weary of the American media's take on every single thing, this post by the blogger Saudiwoman gives a good overview of the Saudi reaction, in both support and condemnation, including this: [Y]ou have Sheikh Monjed who is originally Syrian describe Manal as a sinful, conspiring and malicious hypocrite and those who support her as evil, infidels, and licentious, conspiring, immoral people who only follow their desires and whims. His words were so harsh and heavy on the accusations that there was a backlash and the next day he issued a statement where he does not apologize but at least shows some remorse. He insists that June 17th was not chosen randomly. That the campaign date is evidence of a Shia conspiracy because it falls on the Hijri date 15th of Rajab which he claims is a Shia holiday or has religious implications for Shia, very Dan Brown, Islamic version. There are many more but the above had the biggest impact ... another Shiekh, Dr. Ghazi Al Shamari, calling on the authorities to publicly lash Manal in a women-only mall. He also backtracked the next day by saying that since Manal has apologized we should show her mercy and forgive her. On its surface, this is certainly a debate about the law and the religious and social customs of Saudi Arabia. But like any issue even remotely interesting, it seems to be about more. In this case, it is possible to argue that we are experiencing a case of global machismo fatigue, in which the phenomenon of men in the public trust behaving - and carrying out their civic duties- badly has become utterly tiresome (if not utterly destructive), and the idea that women might be stepping in to take their places a kind of relief. Berlusconi, Strauss-Kahn, Edwards, Ensign, Gingrich, Sanford - why not? Which of course leads to the question, was Tina Brown on to something? By devoting her first issue as editor of Newsweek in March to ""150 Women Who Shake the World,"" maybe so. Of course the idea that the world would be an infinitely better place via the influence and increased freedom of women is not a new one. The seemingly unending revelations of  poor male impulse control in recent months would seem to confirm that. (Well, be honest: Did you really flinch when you heard about Gov. Schwarzenegger's second family? Did you muster the outrage to excoriate Newt Gingrich around your breakfast table for having an affair with his future third wife while he was still married to his second? And what was your assumption when news of the now infamous below-the-belt photo was sent from Rep. Anthony Wiener's Twitter account? Guilty or not? Honest.) Nothing new. And the women ... Have you noticed? That after the swirl of controversy and finger-pointing following the arrest and indictment of Dominique Strauss-Kahn of a sexual attack on a hotel housekeeper, it seems that a cultural shift has taken place in France - a bout of national self-reflection and a vocal rising up of women against a male-dominated culture. Not incidentally, the front runner to replace Strauss-Kahn as the next head of the International Monetary Fund is Christine Lagarde, France's  finance minister, who Joseph E. Stiglitz wrote at Slate today, ""has won the respect of all of those with whom she has worked."" That, closer to home, Michele Bachmann seems certain to declare her candidacy for the presidency, and another woman, an outspoken Alaskan, one whom some people actually fear can win, is acting a lot like a person gunning for the chief executive's job, too, taking an early symbolic shot from Bunker Hill at the apparently well-behaved Mitt Romney. Say what you will about these developments, they still suggest the possibility that two women may be on the Republican ticket at once. A first. That, on a lighter note, Lady Gaga has taken over popular music, and has even been compared to Mother Teresa (in The Economist, no less), leaving all testosterone-mad rappers and Fender shredders in her sparkly dust. A certainly unintended side effect of all this has been a spate of commentary on the subject of gender and power, an issue at play in every single human community on the globe. Let us read: Paula Marantz Cohen at The Smart Set on the French sea change: The uproar over Dominique Strauss-Kahn's behavior strikes me as marking a possible turning point in Gallic culture - and in Continental European culture more generally, if we consider the Italian Prime Minister's recent travails. Both these men are being taken to task for behaving in the way that men in their cultures have long been expected to behave. But just as the rules of the global marketplace are changing, so are the rules of gender behavior, even in France. The next head of the IMF may, for the first time, be a Turk, a Chinese, an African - and possibly a woman, a Frenchwoman at that. The French may finally be taking a hard look at gender behavior - resulting in more gender equity, though less romance. My French friend tells me opinions on DSK's ordeal has undergone an evolution in the short period of its press coverage - from sympathy with the suspect and disdain for American police procedure to national self-examination and mea culpa. (Maureen Dowd's Tuesday column also chronicled how the French are moving on.) In the New Yorker, a piece by Ariel Levy asks, Have Italians had enough of Silvio Berlusconi-and the culture he embodies?Ninety-five per cent of Italian men have never operated a washing machine. Until 1981, a ""crime of honor""-killing your wife for being unfaithful or your sister for having premarital sex-could be treated as a lesser offense than other murders; as late as 2007, a man in Palermo was sentenced to just two days in jail for murdering his wife after their children testified that she had been disrespectful to him. According to the World Economic Forum's 2010 Global Gender Gap Report, Italy ranks seventy-fourth in women's rights, between the Dominican Republic and Gambia. Women constitute a smaller percentage of the workforce in Italy than in any other country in the European Union, apart from Malta, and those who work make barely half as much as their male counterparts. Emma Bonino, a Radical Party leader, told me, ""When I was Minister of European Affairs, in 2007, I had to prepare a report on the status of women in Italy. The data came in, and I remember that I rejected it twice, saying to my staff, 'That's impossible: it cannot be so bad.' "" There is growing dissatisfaction with the status of women in Italy. In 2009, in response to rising sexual-assault statistics, Berlusconi said, ""We don't have enough soldiers to stop rape because our women are so beautiful."" Several months later, fifteen thousand people signed a petition to the wives of G8 leaders, asking them to urge their husbands to show support for Italian women by boycotting a summit with Berlusconi. At The Guardian, Amanda Marcotte, discussing the Anthony Wiener debacle,  noted how manufactured sex scandals in fact end up being sexual harassment: Being targeted by these baseless sexual harassment campaigns is traumatic for the objects, as the latest victim, Gennette Cordova, is finding out. Your dating history and your looks are combed over by strange men, who are clearly wiping the drool off their mouths as they analyse the shape of your breasts and the length of your skirt for more ""evidence"" that you are the honeypot their hated politician has fallen into. Every picture of you available becomes the new Zapruder film, examined endlessly for some tiny detail that could be used to claim you're a slattern, a girl gone wild, a despicable flirt who can't be trusted not to sleep with every man who isn't a rightwing blogger. If you recede from the public view in response, you're accused of hiding something. If you face down your accusers, you're accused of being an attention whore. (Here, Ms. Cordova confirms this, describing her life being turned upside down by the scandal."") As for Manal al-Sharif, Saudiwoman writes: ""This is an intelligent capable woman asking for something that should have been a given; driving her own car. Shame on her for speaking out for her right. Shame on her for not putting up with 38,000 SAR ($10,000) annual tax for being a woman in Saudi. Shame on her for standing up for women much less fortunate then her, when she easily could have been quiet in her high-paying job and comfortable compound. Shame on her for being a courageous patriotic woman."" It seems like it might be a long road.",2011,"Saudi Arabia"

"233","Saudi Monarch Grants Women Right to Vote","MENA","King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on Sunday granted women the right to vote and run in future municipal elections, the biggest change in a decade for women in a puritanical kingdom that practices strict separation of the sexes, including banning women from driving. Saudi women, who are legally subject to male chaperones for almost any public activity, hailed the royal decree as an important, if limited, step toward making them equal to their male counterparts. They said the uprisings sweeping the Arab world for the past nine months -- along with sustained domestic pressure for women's rights and a more representative form of government -- prompted the change. ''There is the element of the Arab Spring, there is the element of the strength of Saudi social media, and there is the element of Saudi women themselves, who are not silent,'' said Hatoon al-Fassi, a history professor and one of the women who organized a campaign demanding the right to vote this spring. ''Plus, the fact that the issue of women has turned Saudi Arabia into an international joke is another thing that brought the decision now.'' Although political activists celebrated the change, they also cautioned how deep it would go and how fast, given that the king referred to the next election cycle, which would not be until 2015. Some women wondered aloud how they would be able to campaign for office when they were not even allowed to drive. And there is a long history of royal decrees stalling, as weak enactment collides with the bulwark of traditions ordained by the Wahhabi sect of Islam and its fierce resistance to change. In his announcement, the king said that women would also be appointed to the Majlis Al-Shura, a consultative council that advises the monarchy on matters of public policy. But it is a toothless body that avoids matters of royal prerogative, like where the nation's oil revenue goes. ''We refuse to marginalize the role of women in Saudi society,'' the king said in an address to the Shura, noting during the five minutes he spent on the subject that senior religious scholars had endorsed the change. Even under the new law, it was unclear how many women would take part in elections. In many aspects of life, men -- whether fathers, husbands or brothers -- prevent women from participating in legal activities. Public education for women took years to gain acceptance after it was introduced in 1960. King Abdullah, the 87-year-old monarch who has a reputation for pushing reforms opposed by some of his half-brothers among the senior princes, said the monarchy was simply following Islamic guidelines, and that those who shunned such practices were ''arrogant.'' Some analysts described the king's choice as the path of least resistance. Many Saudis have been loudly demanding that all 150 members of the Shura be elected, not appointed. By suddenly putting women in the mix, activists feared, the government might use the excuse of integration to delay introducing a nationally elected council. Political participation for women is also a less contentious issue than granting them the right to drive, an idea fiercely opposed by some of the most powerful clerics and princes. Even as the king made the political announcement, activists said that one prominent opponent of the ban, Najla al-Hariri, was being questioned Sunday for continuing her stealth campaign of driving. Mrs. Hariri has been vociferous in demanding the right as a single mother who cannot afford one of the ubiquitous foreign chauffeurs to ferry her children to school. In recent weeks, a woman even drove down King Fahd Expressway, the main thoroughfare through downtown Riyadh, activists said. Municipal elections in the kingdom are scheduled for Thursday, but the campaign is almost over and the king said that women would be able to nominate themselves and vote ''as of the next session.'' Introduced in 2005, the municipal councils have proved disappointing for those who had hoped they would create more political change. Saudi Arabia remains an absolute monarchy. Fouad al-Farhan, once jailed briefly for his blog critical of the monarchy, led a slate of young Saudis from the cosmopolitan commercial capital of Jidda, determined to run in this year's municipal elections to use whatever democratic openings they might afford for change. When the final list of candidates was posted weeks ago, his name had been unceremoniously removed -- without anyone from the Jidda governorate run by Prince Khalid al-Faisal calling him to explain, Mr. Farhan said. Despite the snail's pace of change, women on Sunday were optimistic that the right to vote and run would give them leverage to change the measures, big and small, that hem them in. ''It is a good sign, and we have to take advantage of it,'' said Maha al-Qahtani, one of the women who defied the ban on driving this year, said of the king's announcement. ''But we still need more rights.'' Women require the permission of a male sponsor, or ''mahram,'' to travel or undertake much of the commercial activity needed to run a business. They inhabit separate and often inferior spaces in restaurants, banks and health clubs, when they are allowed in at all. Women were granted the right to their own national identification cards in 2001, the last major step that many hoped would lead to greater public freedom, but it failed to materialize. The Saudi judiciary, a conservative bastion, has yet to allow female lawyers, a new phenomenon, to argue in court. And a royal decree issued earlier this year that women should be allowed to work in public to sell lingerie has not been enacted -- leaving Saudi women to buy their bras from male clerks, who mostly hail from South Asia. Social media, heavily used in Saudi Arabia to start with, lit up with the announcement, with supporters endorsing it as ''a great leap forward,'' as one Twitter post put it. Some conservatives inveighed against it. ''Muslim scholars believe it is un-Islamic to allow women to participate in the Shura council,'' wrote Mohammad al-Habdan, one such scholar. In March, King Abdullah announced $130 billion in public spending over the next decade on measures like affordable housing, hoping for social peace after the first governments in the region were toppled. But uprisings have continued to challenge Arab governments. Around the Persian Gulf, many citizens of the wealthy monarchies jealously track the rights and largess granted in neighboring states. On Saturday, 19 men and one woman were elected to a legislative body in the United Arab Emirates. Last summer, Qatar granted a notable 60 percent pay raise to all state employees. Such regional and domestic pressures weighed on the Saudi monarchy to make some type of gesture. The one King Abdullah chose was less sweeping than many political activists had wanted, but one they hoped was a sign of more to come. ''It is not something that will change the life of most women,'' said Fawaziah Bakr, an education professor in Riyadh, noting that she had just held a monthly dinner for professional women who were buzzing with excitement about the change. ''We are now looking for even more,'' Mrs. Bakr said. ''The Arab spring means that things are changing, that the political power has to listen to the people. The spring gave us a clear voice.''",2011,"Saudi Arabia"
"234","Saudi Arabia and Its Women","MENA","King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia deserves credit for his long overdue decision to give women the right to vote, to run in municipal elections and to be appointed as full voting members of the Majlis Al-Shura, a government advisory group. It is a first step toward moving his country into the modern world but not nearly enough. The list of fundamental rights still denied to Saudi women is long and shameful. Men -- their fathers or husbands -- control whether they can travel, work, receive health care, attend school or start a business. Women are banned from driving. Even after Sunday's announcement, women will not be able to vote and run for municipal elections until 2015 -- even though there is an election scheduled for Thursday -- and they will need the approval of a male family member to exercise either right. The king is undoubtedly trying to head off a push for more forceful changes inspired by pro-democracy movements in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. In March, when Saudi activists called for protests, he responded by barring demonstrations and announcing nearly $130 billion in public spending. But the king also considers himself a reformer. To really prove that, he is going to have to stop pandering to ultraconservative members of the royal family and extremist Wahhabi clerics who are determined to keep Saudi women in shackles. Laws must be changed to provide greater protections for women who are raped or suffer domestic abuse. The archaic ban on driving by women also must be lifted. In June, some Saudi women held a high-profile right-to-drive campaign that resulted in dozens of arrests. Those cases should be dropped. One area where Saudi women are making strides is in education. But while they are 58 percent of the college graduates, they are only 14 percent of the work force.

"236","Saudi Women Defy Driving Ban","MENA","Updated | 3:15 p.m. Although random acts of women driving were reported in major cities across Saudi Arabia on Friday, the protest against the longstanding ban appears to have been smaller than initially anticipated after the Saudi government imprisoned a main organizer for nine days last month. Scattered reports by social media and an informal network of activists suggested that the number of women who drove was in the dozens, with few incidents of confrontations with either the traffic or the morals police reported. At least half a dozen women who were stopped were escorted home and admonished not to drive again, said activists reached by telephone. Maha al-Qahtani, an information technology specialist for the government, drove around Riyadh in clear weather for 45 minutes with her husband, Mohamed, a human rights activist, in the car. She braced for a siren after passing each of about five police cars, she said, but they ignored her. ""I woke up today believing with every part of me that this is my right, I woke up believing this is my duty and I was no longer afraid,"" said Mrs. Qahtani, adding that she brought a change of clothes and a prayer rug with her in case she was detained. Later in the day, Mrs. Qahtani's husband reported on Twitter that his wife was stopped by the police during a subsequent trip along King Fahad Road in Riyadh, and ticketed for driving without a license. She posted a photograph of the ticket on Yfrog. Lynsey Addario, an American photojournalist who was with the Qahtanis on their later drive, reported on Twitter that they were stopped by six police cars. She observed: ""You would think they caught Zawahiri, or someone else from [Al] Qaeda. How dangerous woman drivers are."" She was referring to Ayman al-Zawahri, the new leader of Al Qaeda. About 15 minutes later, Ms. Addario added, ""They let us go. Police didn't know what to do, so gave the woman a ticket for not having a license."" According to her husband, Mrs. Qahtani who is licensed to drive, but outside Saudi Arabia. Later in the day Ahmed Al Omran, a Saudi blogger and journalist who is working with N.P.R. in Washington reported that Mrs. Qahtani told him that ""she won't pay the ticket she got, she will instead frame it and hang it on the wall."" From its inception in April, the protest was not meant to be a mass driving effort. Rather, women with legal driving licenses from other countries were urged to run mundane errands - going to the grocery store, taking their kids someplace - in order to underscore the fact that women driving is a normal right. Manal al-Sharif, a 32-year-old single mother, started the call for the June 17 protest in April with a Facebook page and Twitter feed. But after posting video of herself driving around Al-Khobar in Eastern Province, she was arrested in late May and unexpectedly thrown in jail for nine days. Many supporters were disappointed, feeling that she had jumped the gun and jeopardized them all by taking a confrontational approach. Before her arrest, Ms. Sharif had encouraged other women to follow her example and document their acts of ""driving while female"" by posting video online. A small number of clips and still photographs posted on Facebook and YouTube by activists on Friday appeared to show female hands steering cars through the kingdom's streets. One video, which appears to have been recorded just after midnight on Friday, begins with an image of a woman's iPhone displaying Friday's date. A woman wearing a niqab as she sits at the wheel says: ""Today is Friday June 17th. I would like to go to supermarket. I feel I can go anywhere I want and it feels so great. If I need anything, I am able to go and get it myself. I am loving this experience. I think its time for society to accept us driving."" There were, however, signs that efforts were being made to stifle news of the protest. One video, posted on YouTube earlier on Friday showing female hands on a steering wheel, was later deleted from YouTube. Sara al-Bassam, a blogger who used her Twitter feed to point to reports of women who took to the streets, explained that she was not playing a more active role, by driving herself, only because, as ""a direct result of the ban: I don't know how to."" Women driving remains a sensitive issue in Saudi Arabia. For religious conservatives, it is a kind of Alamo, the ban a sign that the kingdom still holds to its traditions and has not caved to Western pressure. The ruling family has been especially dependent on this base of supporters in recent months as protests erupted across the region. The mufti, the highest religious figure in the kingdom, rolled out a fatwa banning protests, a called echoed forcefully by mosque preachers. Many Saudi activists considered the harsh treatment of Ms. Sharif a warning from the monarchy against trying to organize any kind of movement via social media. The initiative for women to drive was the strongest effort so far in the kingdom inspired by the regional climate. ""Women in Saudi Arabia see other women in the Middle East making revolutions, women in Yemen and Egypt at the forefront of revolutions, being so bold, toppling entire governments,"" said Waleed Abu Alkhair, whose wife drove around Jidda, even though he was out of the country. ""The women Saudi Arabia looked at themselves and they realized 'Wow! We can't even drive!'"" Mr. Abu Alkhair said he knew about a score of women who drove, and aside from one being questioned by the police for two hours before being released, none were bothered. Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, the spokesman for the Interior Ministry, could not be reached for comment. Once the campaign had been announced, there were frequent threats by opponents to punish the women who drove either by beating them or smashing their cars. ""We want women to keep fighting this fight and to be free, it will help to liberate the entire society,"" Mr. Abu Alkhair said. One protester, speaking anonymously because she signed a religious police confession that said she would not drive again, said that transportation seemed like a pretty small issue compared to the demands in other Arab states but that even ""a small fight would be revolutionary for Saudi Arabia."" On Twitter, a number of Saudi women claimed to have driven on Friday - although those reports were impossible to verify independently. Several women also reported receiving support from Saudi men, and there were even a few jokes. ""I'll be arriving to Riyadh in the evening,"" quipped Khalid Khalifa, a comedian. ""Any ladies free around that time to pick me up from the airport?"" In the weeks after Ms. Sharif's arrest, a debate erupted between those religious clerics and their conservative followers who oppose women driving and the kingdom's increasingly outspoken women. Opponents largely argued that Saudi society was not ready for it, and that a woman should not be thrown into the wilds of Saudi driving habits nor held responsible for any accidents. Worse, opponents argue that it will lead to the public mingling of the sexes. Supporters mock the clerics for putting everything in a sexual context and wonder aloud why it is O.K. for Saudi women to be driven around by an army of about 800,000 foreign men from Southeast Asia imported as drivers. When a cleric in Eastern Province, Sheik Mohammed al-Monajid, branded Ms. Sharif ""fasika,""  which translates as amoral or loose, his surname became a hashtag on Twitter as critics poured on the scorn. After another woman, Najla Hariri, said that she had driven around Jidda, a commercial city on the Red Sea coast known for its more liberal ways, she appeared as a guest on a television program on the Daleel satellite channel, debating Sheik Walid al-Rushdy, a cleric opposed to women driving. When he pressed her about how often she had been harassed by men, Ms. Hariri stated that other drivers either flashed signs of encouragement or ignored her. The sheik responded that Ms. Hariri must be ""qawaa'id,"" a classical Arabic term for a woman beyond the age of sexual desirability. ""Well at least you didn't call me a prostitute,"" shot back Ms. Hariri, since women drivers are often categorized thus by the clergy. Opposition was not limited to the clergy, nor men. ""Not all women in Saudi want to drive; the majority of women are against it,"" said Tala al-Hejaylan, a woman who is a lawyer in Eastern Province.  ""There needs to be a dialogue among Saudi Arabian women themselves before undertaking such drastic, counterproductive rebellious displays like today."" Open confrontation with the ruling family and the clerics will not speed the advance of women's rights, she said. Many women argue that driving distracts from more important issues, like ending the male guardianship, which gives men control over every aspect of women's lives. Although the arrest of Ms. Sharif discouraged women from driving, the fact that it enlivened the debate was in marked contrast to the first (and last) such protest in November 1990. Clerics branded the 47 women amoral and the Saud monarchy confiscated their passports, firing those working for the government. Many went into isolation for their own safety and the issue was shelved for years. Aside from the issue of religious opposition, Saudis also question aloud whether the continued ban boils down to a business proposition. There are widespread suspicions in the country that those who controls the visa process - and in Saudi Arabia that means the princes of the ruling family - have made a business out of controlling the black market in visas for drivers, which can cost more than $3,000 apiece. Many young married couples decry the fact that they cannot afford that, not to mention the monthly salary for a driver of about $600. The more liberal princes support allowing women to drive. Prince Talal bin Abdel Aziz, 79 and long among the most outspoken members of the royal family, argues that such reforms lag in the kingdom because the leading members of the royal family have failed to pass any power or influence down to the younger generations. ""Bravo to the women!"" the prince said in an interview. ""Why should women drive in the countryside and not in the cities?"" Women have long driven in rural areas of Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah and other key royals have said in interviews with foreign reporters that they expected Saudi women to drive one day soon, but they have been mute amidst the current debate. This week, Brian Whitaker, a journalist who writes for The Guardian, looked at the possible wider implications of the driving protest in a post on his blog headlined ""Rise of the Muslim Sisterhood?"" Mr. Whitaker observed: So far, the Saudi regime has escaped the kind of protests seen in a number of other Arab countries. It has declared street demonstrations to be un-Islamic and well as illegal, and is well-equipped to deal with them ... assuming the protesters are men. The one thing it is not prepared for, and would probably have difficulty coping with, is a mass revolt by women. And why bother preparing for that? Women, after all, are expected to obey their menfolk and not trouble their heads with things like politics. Saudi women, of course, have plenty to revolt about. They are oppressed, discriminated against and kept apart - excluded from many of the activities that for men would be normal. Paradoxically, though, the patriarchal system that keeps them apart from men also gives them a unique kind of freedom to organize and agitate beyond the gaze of male eyes (which inevitably includes most of the state's surveillance system).

"238","Score 1 for Saudi Women's Rights","MENA","DUBAI - It's only just the runup to the London Olympics, and Saudi women athletes seem to have already suffered a near miss. Last week Saudi Arabia announced that women would be allowed to compete in the games, a landmark change from the ultra-strict Islamic mores that ban women from public competition. But then the one Saudi woman set to compete in London, the equestrian Dalma Rushdi Malhas, had to bow out due to an injured horse. As the stopwatch clicks toward the opening ceremony, Saudi Arabia is under pressure to find other female athletes to compete. But having banned its women and girls from engaging in sports at home, finding one who's had access to Olympic-level training is a long stretch. With sports as with other matters, women's rights are the barometer for change in Saudi Arabia. But the issue of Saudi women in the Olympics also marks a milestone in how the kingdom tackles demands for change. For roughly a decade, the dynamics have worked like this: for fear of a conservative backlash, King Abdullah has taken careful and coordinated steps toward reform. With the Olympics issue, however, it is public pressure, inside the country and out, that seems to have changed official policy. Saudi rulers prefer to shift course on policy when they want and how they want rather than be seen as responding to popular demands. The concessions they do make, like appointing more women to government posts and granting women the theoretical right to vote in future elections, aren't the ones activists specifically demand. It's as if they don't want to set a precedent that would effectively reward protests or public campaigns. But this time, after a wave of international pressure from human rights groups and an active debate in Saudi Arabia about women in sports, public pressure moved policy. Human Rights Watch, among others, lobbied the International Olympic Committee to pressure Saudi Arabia to allow women to compete. (Gender discrimination violates the Olympic Charter.) On the domestic front, women activists like Lina al-Maeena, who coaches the Jeddah United basketball team, are looking for ways that women can play sports while respecting Islamic norms. Her team plays in track-suit abayas that match their traditional headscarves. ""Saudi Arabia is in flux,"" said Theodore Karasik, a Saudi watcher based in Dubai. Saudi royals do seem to be in a progressive phase, relative to the country's past standards, and it's likely to expand given the current politics of Saudi succession. The recent death of Crown Prince Nayef, long feared as an arch-conservative, elevated his more liberal half-brother, Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud, as heir to the throne. And just as Saudi royals are granting women more rights, Saudi women are growing bolder and claiming more rights for themselves. They famously boycotted lingerie shops until male sales clerks were replaced with females ones. And a circle of Saudi women writers is trying to steer the national agenda, rousing debate around issues like child marriage with their newspaper columns. Traveling in Jeddah a few months back, I was taken by the relaxed state of play. More women than I'd ever seen were strolling the malls and seaside boulevards with their hair blowing in the wind, the compulsory headscarf hanging lose around their necks. If they were worried about the religious police, they didn't show it. And if the religious police were around, they weren't taking any issue. At a dinner party in a private home, men and women mixed freely and ladies left their abayas at the door. Even if the Olympic decree is a token gesture, Saudi women say they'll to use it to their advantage. Off the Olympic momentum, they're making a push for sports in schools and athletic federations for women. It would be a bigger win than anything they get in London.",2012,"Saudi Arabia"
"239","Women's Rights in Turkey","MENA","To the Editor: Re ''In Turkey, Fears of a Retreat on Women's Rights'' (news article, April 29): It is disappointing to read such a one-sided account on the state of women's rights in Turkey given the substantial efforts to achieve equality and security for millions of women. Our government has not only adopted far-reaching legislation that strengthens the authorities' ability to prevent and prosecute violence against women, but it has also taken steps to ensure full implementation of these laws. We have intensified the training of law enforcement, health, judicial and other public officials, held numerous symposia and workshops, and launched a broad public education program to raise awareness about women's issues in general and violence against women in particular. Turkey has also signed on to and followed through on international conventions dealing with women's rights and has been conducting joint projects with regional and international institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union and the Council of Europe. To be sure, in Turkey, as in so many nations, there is much work to do when it comes to the challenge of women's empowerment and gender equality. But your article missed the real story: we fully recognize this challenge, and we're tackling it aggressively. NAMIK TAN Ambassador of Turkey Washington, April 30, 2012",2012,"Turkey"
"240","Tunisian Women March to Defend Equality","MENA","As Reuters reported, thousands of Tunisian women marched in the capital, Tunis, Monday night, to protest a provision in the new Islamist government's draft constitution describing women as ""complementary to men.""

Video of the march posted on YouTube by the Tunisian blog Nawaat showed protesters chanting for ""freedom and feminist dignity,"" and carrying banners and placards calling for ""equality with men"" and ""preserving the gains of women."" One marcher held a sign noting that when police officers beat demonstrators, they do so ""with no differentiation between man and woman."" In an essay published by Nawaat on Wednesday, Farhat Othman argued that pressure from Muslim fundamentalists on the moderate Islamist government to remove protections for women are ""a rearguard battle by minority communities seeking to impose by whatever means purely sexist and biased"" laws unrelated to Islam's founding principles.",2012,"Tunisia"

"242","The Women of Afghanistan","MENA","Afghanistan can be a hard and cruel land, especially for women and girls. Many fear they will be even more vulnerable to harsh tribal customs and the men who impose them after American troops withdraw by the end of 2014.Womens' rights have made modest but encouraging gains over the past decade. But these could disappear without a strong commitment to preserve and advance them from Afghan leaders, Washington and other international partners. Severe restrictions imposed by the Taliban, on access to education, health care and work, before they were ousted from power after Sept. 11 have been lifted in government-controlled areas. Women have run for office, been named to government posts and become more involved in Afghan society; some operate their own businesses. The 2004 Constitution guaranteed equal rights. In 2009, a new law banned violence against women and set new penalties for underage and forced marriage, rape and other abuses. Many more girls are in school and maternity death rates are down. Much, of course, remains to be done. More than half of Afghan girls are still not in school, and, of those who are, few will stay long enough to graduate. Intimidation is commonplace; girls have been attacked and even doused with acid to be kept from attending school. It is not uncommon, especially in rural areas, for families to trade daughters into marriage or prostitution to settle debts. Women abused by their husbands or families too often end up in jail instead of their abusers. A recent study by Human Rights Watch, which interviewed 58 women and girls in prison, found that half were jailed for acts that any reasonable person would not consider a crime, like running away from abusive situations. People who force women into marriage, often at very young ages, or subject them to violence, are rarely prosecuted, the group said. Female victims get little support from police and judges, and they face the added injustice of being punished for committing ''moral crimes,'' like ''zina'' -- sexual intercourse between two people not married to each other. Criminalizing zina is contrary to Afghanistan's international obligations, the group says. There are rare victories. The Times reported on Saturday that an appeals court held up prison sentences of 10 years each for the in-laws who tortured a 13-year-old girl when she refused to become a prostitute or have sex with the man she was forced to marry. President Hamid Karzai's record on women's rights is less than encouraging. While he has pardoned women accused of moral crimes, he has failed to vigorously enforce the violence against women law. In March, he signed off on a decree from the country's highest religious council stating that women were secondary to men. With his government and the United States exploring peace talks with the Taliban, many activists worry that women's interests will be sacrificed as part of a strategic deal. The Obama administration has insisted that this will not happen, most recently at the Tokyo donors' conference in July when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton promised that ''the United States will continue to stand strongly by the women of Afghanistan.'' She and other Western leaders will have to keep nudging Mr. Karzai in that direction, even as they invest in schools, teachers, shelters and rule-of-law programs. Right now, it appears as if Washington and other donors are chiefly interested in building up Afghanistan's expensive Army and finishing infrastructure projects. One bright spot is that more Afghan women seem to have found their voice and have not been timid about advocating for their own rights. But all Afghans should be invested in empowering women. As Mrs. Clinton has argued, there is plenty of evidence to show that no country can grow and prosper in today's world if women are marginalized and oppressed.",2012,"Afghanistan"
"243","Family Life According to the Brotherhood","MENA","CAIRO -- Women are erratic, emotional, and they make good wives and mothers but never a leader or ruler. Or so Osama Abou Salama, professor of botany at Cairo University and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, told young men and women in premarital counseling classes. The women did not object. Since the Muslim Brotherhood rose to power, much of the uncertainty over its social agenda is stirred by its undefined attitude toward women. Will the Brotherhood's leaders try to impose a conservative dress code? Will they bar women from certain fields of work? Will they promote segregation at schools? In a country where the vast majority of women already cover their hair, disregard any collective call for action and voluntarily separate from men in coed environments, that may seem academic. But Mr. Abou Salama asks anyway. ''Can you, as a woman, take a decision and handle the consequences of your decision?'' A number of women shook their head. ''No. But men can. And God created us this way because a ship cannot have more than one captain.'' None of the 30 or so young men and women in the class winced. More than any other political group in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood is most fluent in the dialect of the masses. By upholding patriarchal and traditional values around a woman's place in society, it garners popular support, builds political capital and reinforces a socially conservative paradigm. ''The woman is the symbol of a moral platform through which easy gains can be made,'' said Hania Sholkamy, anthropologist and associate professor at the Social Research Center of the American University in Cairo. ''Those who deprive women of their rights, limit their freedom or place them in a subordinate position believe that the political cost of doing so is very low.'' The lectures of Mr. Abou Salama, who has raised three daughters, are part of a four-week workshop dubbed Bride and Groom Against Satan and sponsored by Family House, a Muslim Brotherhood-funded charity. Among its many activities, Family House offers financial support to struggling households, provides a matchmaking service and sponsors mass weddings for low-income couples. ''This is part of the reformist methodology of the Muslim Brotherhood,'' explains Walaa Abdel Halim, the Family House coordinator who organizes the youth counseling workshop. ''Shaping a righteous individual leads to shaping a righteous family and by shaping a righteous family, you get a righteous society that can choose a righteous leader.'' For Ms. Abdel Halim, 22, her efforts bore fruit when Mohamed Morsi was elected president in June. At the time, Mr. Morsi gave assurances to protect the rights of women and include them in decision-making. Less than three months into his presidency, Mr. Morsi has already broken a campaign promise to appoint a woman as vice president. Instead, he named a team of 21 senior aides and advisers last week that includes three women. Of those three, Omaima Kamel is a medical professor at Cairo University and member of the Muslim Brotherhood since 1981. One of her main areas of work and interest, she says, is women. ''Let's face it, if your work took you away from your fundamental duties at home and if your success came at the cost of your family life and the stability of your children, then you are the one who stands to lose,'' she said by telephone. ''A woman can work as much as she wants, but within the framework of our religious restrictions.'' Many analysts and critics of the Muslim Brotherhood see such vagueness as conducive to capricious laws and social constraints on women. ''There is an absence of a well-defined vision so they use words like 'religious restrictions,''' says Ibrahim el-Houdaiby, a researcher of Islamic movements and former member of the Brotherhood. ''O.K., sure, so what exactly are those restrictions so we can know them and figure out how to deal with them? As long as we don't define what those limits are, then we can expand them to the point where women, practically speaking, cannot work.'' Outlining some parameters, Ms. Kamel listed ''respect,'' ''modest dress'' and ''limited or no mixing between the sexes.'' In Mr. Morsi's political program, called ''the renaissance,'' there is overt emphasis on a woman's ''authentic role as wife, mother and purveyor of generations.'' The program then makes recommendations to safeguard family life; foremost among them are premarital classes for youth. Free from the Mubarak regime, the Muslim Brotherhood's social outreach programs have mushroomed. In less than a year, Family House expanded from a single office to 18 branches around Egypt. Back at the mother branch, in the densely populated Cairo neighborhood of Nasr City, Mr. Abou Salama walks into a spacious room where front rows are for men, back seats for women. He lectures on qualities to seek in a partner, getting acquainted under parental supervision, dealing with in-laws and successfully consummating marriage. In his social paradigm, understanding that the woman was created to be an obedient wife and mother and the man to fend for his family holds the secret to a happy marriage. ''I want you to be the flower that attracts a bee to make honey, not the trash that attracts flies and dirt,'' Mr. Abou Salama said, encouraging the women not to flaunt their bodies. All the women in the room were veiled; most of them wore long loose dresses, and four had full-face covers. ''A woman takes pleasure in being a follower and finds ease in obeying a husband who loves her.''",2012,"Egypt"

The drafting of what will serve as Egypt's fundamental charter has been marked by arguments over the makeup of the committee and pitched battles over pages of text, including articles dealing with women's rights, Islamic law, executive power and the proper role of the state. Liberal groups and others that asked the courts to dissolve the committee on legal grounds have been concerned that its Islamist majority is trying to create the basis for an Islamic state. Ultraconservative Muslims have argued that, on the contrary, the constitutional drafts so far have been insufficiently deferential to their concerns. The decision to refer the case left an uncertain landscape. While the judges of the Supreme Constitutional Court have a history of ruling against Islamists -- as they did by dissolving the Islamist-led Parliament in June -- many analysts said the court was unlikely to act in time to stop the drafting committee from completing the text. Just two months before a scheduled public ratification vote, there is still no clear picture of what the final document will say, and on Tuesday committee members said many of the most contentious articles were still being deliberated. ''I think it's all in dispute, and I think it looks like it will come out in the end,'' said Nathan J. Brown, a professor of political science at George Washington University who studies the Egyptian legal system. Members of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's main Islamist movement, called the decision on Tuesday positive. ''The constituent assembly has a major chance to finish its work and to allow for real participation,'' said Ahmed Sobei, a spokesman for the group. The assembly is supposed to complete its work by Dec. 12. Apart from Islamic law, there have been arguments about minority rights, the role of the judiciary and the powers of the president. There are also persistent complaints that the draft articles released so far are too timid and hardly reflect the change envisioned by Egypt's revolutionaries and their demands for justice, social rights and the dismantling of former President Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian state. Though some of the draft language that has been released hews closely to Egypt's 1971 Constitution -- including on women's rights -- women's groups have argued that the changed political context since Islamists took power requires stronger guarantees. In a worrying sign for liberals and other secular-leaning figures, ultraconservative Muslims known as Salafis said on Tuesday that they were feeling more comfortable with the draft after the insertion of language meant to clarify references to Islamic law. In language borrowed from the 1971 Constitution, Article 2 of the latest draft says that ''the principles of Islamic law are the main source of legislation.'' While Salafis initially wanted to drop ''principles of'' from that clause, a spokesman for the largest Salafi party said they had settled for an additional clause that elaborated on what the principles were, language that some believe would make the law more rigid. ''We have an obligation to God,'' said Younis Makhyoun, a Salafi member of the drafting committee. ''We're facing a fondness of anything coming from the West. We must have independence and pride in our belief, legacy and religion.'' But Gaber Nassar, a constitutional scholar on the committee, said, ''Nobody is going to commit to this article.'' He said Salafis on the committee, and not members of the Brotherhood, were responsible for making Islamic law a contentious issue. ''They have an understanding of the issue that nobody could approve,'' Dr. Nassar said. Given the controversies, some have suggested creating a temporary constitution and trying again later in a less charged political environment. ''We're constructing the second republic,'' said Zakaria Abdul Aziz, a prominent former reformist judge. ''If we keep the same institutions, it's going to be exactly like the first republic, without a new philosophy.",2012,"Egypt"
"245","Extolling Female Subservience, And Adding Followers in Egypt","MENA","CAIRO -- Women are erratic and emotional, and they make good wives and mothers -- but never leaders or rulers. That, at least, is what Osama Abou Salama, a professor of botany at Cairo University and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, told young men and women during a recent premarital counseling class. What was striking, though, was the absence of any reaction. None of the 30 people in the class so much as winced. ''A woman,'' Mr. Abou Salama said, ''takes pleasure in being a follower and finds ease in obeying a husband who loves her.'' Since the Brotherhood rose to power and one of its former leaders was elected president, much of the uncertainty over its social agenda has centered on its plans for women. Will the Brotherhood try to impose a conservative dress code? Will it try to bar women from certain fields of work? Will its leaders promote segregation at schools? But in a country where a vast majority of women already cover their hair and voluntarily separate from men in coed environments, those questions are largely academic. Mr. Abou Salama's class makes that case. ''Can you, as a woman, take a decision and handle the consequences of your decision?'' he asked. A number of women shook their heads even before Mr. Abou Salama provided his answer: ''No. But men can. And God created us this way because a ship cannot have more than one captain.'' More than any other political group in Egypt, the Brotherhood is fluent in the dialect of the masses. By upholding patriarchal and traditional values about a woman's place in society, it garners popular support, builds political capital and reinforces social conservatism. ''The woman is the symbol of a moral platform through which easy gains can be made,'' said Hania Sholkamy, an anthropologist and an associate professor at the Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo. ''Those who deprive women of their rights, limit their freedom or place them in a subordinate position believe that the political cost of doing so is very low.'' The lectures of Mr. Abou Salama, who has raised three daughters, are part of a four-week workshop called ''Bride and Groom Against Satan'' and sponsored by Family House, a charity financed by the Brotherhood. It is one of several Brotherhood efforts that have grown since the revolution, reflecting, as much as promoting, the religious values that define a large segment of society. Among its many activities, Family House offers financial support to struggling households, provides a matchmaking service and sponsors mass weddings for low-income couples. ''This is part of the reformist methodology of the Muslim Brotherhood,'' said Walaa Abdel Halim, the Family House coordinator who organizes the youth counseling workshop. ''Shaping a righteous individual leads to shaping a righteous family, and by shaping a righteous family, you get a righteous society that can choose a righteous leader.'' Those broader efforts at shaping a conservative religious society, played out over decades by the Brotherhood, were seen as partly responsible for helping elect Mohamed Morsi president in June. At the time, Mr. Morsi, who resigned from the Brotherhood after taking office, gave assurances that he would protect the rights of women and include them in decision making. Less than three months into his presidency, though, Mr. Morsi has not fulfilled a campaign promise to appoint a woman as a vice president. Instead, he named a team of 21 senior aides and advisers last week that included three women. One of those three, Omaima Kamel, a medical professor at Cairo University and a member of the Brotherhood since 1981, makes it clear that she is not about to press society to change attitudes about women. ''Let's face it, if your work took you away from your fundamental duties at home and if your success came at the cost of your family life and the stability of your children, then you are the one who stands to lose,'' she said by telephone. ''A woman can work as much as she wants, but within the framework of our religious restrictions.'' Many analysts and critics of the Brotherhood see that kind of philosophy, one that gives women independence so long as they maintain their traditional obligations, as effectively constraining women to established gender roles. ''There is an absence of a well-defined vision, so they use words like 'religious restrictions,' '' said Ibrahim el-Houdaiby, a researcher of Islamic movements and a former member of the Brotherhood. ''O.K., sure, so what exactly are those restrictions, so we can know them and figure out how to deal with them? As long as we don't define what those limits are, then we can expand them to the point where women, practically speaking, cannot work.'' In Mr. Morsi's political program, called ''The Renaissance,'' there is an emphasis on a woman's ''authentic role as wife, mother and purveyor of generations.'' The program then makes recommendations to safeguard family life; foremost among them are premarital classes for youths. Free from the restrictions of the government of Hosni Mubarak, which outlawed the Brotherhood, the movement's social outreach programs have mushroomed since Mr. Morsi's election. In less than a year, Family House expanded from a single office to 18 branches around Egypt and is developing a plan to encourage all couples to attend. At the group's headquarters, in the densely populated Cairo neighborhood of Nasr City, Mr. Abou Salama walked into a spacious room where the front seats were for men and the back seats were for women. He lectured on qualities to seek in a partner, getting acquainted under parental supervision, dealing with in-laws and consummating marriage. In his social paradigm, understanding that the woman was created to be an obedient wife and mother and that the man was created to fend for his family holds the secret to a happy marriage. ''I want you to be the flower that attracts a bee to make honey, not the trash that attracts flies and dirt,'' Mr. Abou Salama said as the women listened intently.",2012,"Egypt"

"247","The Trust Women Conference","MENA","In London, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates - Shirin Ebadi from Iran, and, by video from Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi - will kick off the first Trust Women conference held by the International Herald Tribune and ThomsonReuters Foundation. The aim of the two-day gathering is to examine how law can be used to further the empowerment of women and enhance gender diversity. Lawyers, aid organizations and government officials from all over will meet representatives of women from all over who need either the existing laws of their countries to be enforced in their favor, or to get laws passed that will bolster the advancement of women. The IHT will publish an eight-page Special Report on Tuesday, when the conference opens. Executive Editor Alison Smale will host the first session of the Trust Women conference, examining what happens when culture clashes with the law - a situation which so often means that women who have rights on paper cannot escape forced marriage, cannot inherit property if their husband or other male relatives die, or claim, say, the equal pay so long promised by law in many Western countries. For a vivid and poignant illustration of how insisting on the law can make inroads on even the most ingrained of tribal cultures, read this story by Alissa Rubin from Afghanistan, featured on Page One of Monday's IHT.

"248","A Queen Expresses Hope on the Rights of Arab Women","MENA","LONDON -- Amid worries that the Arab Spring may give way to political Islam and set back the cause of women's rights, Queen Noor of Jordan said Tuesday that it was too soon to give up hope that revolutions in the region would ultimately yield social progress. ''Revolutions are messy,'' she said at a conference in London. ''They take time. They ultimately require negotiation and compromise. Revolutions in the Middle East are taking place in real time as we speak, and I think it is far too soon to give them up for lost.'' Queen Noor conceded that the rise of political Islam had shaken confidence in the progressive social impact of the Arab Spring, highlighting worries on Egypt, where a vote on a new constitution is scheduled for Dec. 15. ''It appears again that women's rights are once again at risk even as revolution progresses,'' she said. No women were appointed to the committee that drew up the new draft constitution in Egypt, and the percentage of female legislators dropped to 2 percent from 12 percent because parliamentary quotas were abolished, she said. However, the region's gender equality ratings by the World Economic Forum have increased in the past two years by 1.2 percent, despite a 5.3 percent drop in Syria. That demonstrates, she said, that the greatest threat to women's rights might be war, not religious conservatism. ''Even as some groups attempt to turn back the clock on Arab women's rights using religious justification, Islam should not be considered the source of misogyny and women's oppression in the region,'' Queen Noor said, adding that setbacks ''do not mean that the revolution has failed, it means it is not finished.'' Queen Noor is the widow of King Hussein of Jordan. The conference, Trust Women, was organized by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and The International Herald Tribune, which is published by The New York Times. Egypt was a central focus of concern at the conference. ''The situation in Egypt is really alarming,'' said Dina Wahba, an Egyptian women's rights activist, who said the draft constitution endangered the rights of women and children. ''We are in a very pessimistic situation,'' she added. ''It looks very grim. It looks very scary.'' Julia Lalla-Maharajh, the founder of the Orchid Project, which is based in London and campaigns to end female genital cutting, said Egypt had ''one of the highest prevalences in the world of female genital cutting: according to Unicef statistics, more than 9 out of 10 women are affected.'' ''There are worrying reports that have suggested that female genital cutting is on the rise, with one call in Parliament for a ban on it to be overturned,'' she said. Ala'a Shehabi, a British-born Bahraini writer and activist, said the uprising in her country had been led by women and was not motivated by the economic discontent that drove some of the other revolutions in the region. ''In the gulf, it's about inequality,'' she said, with issues like corruption also proving important. Manal al-Sharif, a women's rights activist from Saudi Arabia, said that there, too, it was women who were pushing for change. Alaa Murabit, an activist from Libya, argued that the overthrow of the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi had changed the political dynamic. ''Women are getting involved,'' Ms. Murabit said. ''Women are taking the initiative.'' Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the founder of the AHA Foundation, which works to protect the rights of Muslim women, called for an end to placing women under the control of male guardians. There were warnings about women's rights in Western nations, as well. Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor for the northwest of England, said he had dealt with more than 50 so-called honor killings. ''One after another,'' he said, ''I was seeing these stories of people who were being killed because they had a boyfriend, they kissed somebody in public, they wanted to learn to drive, they wanted to go to school.''",2012,"Egypt"
"249","Effort to Strengthen an Afghan Law on Women May Backfire","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Even with some legal protections in place, Afghan women, and sometimes even little girls, can be sold to pay family debts. In the country's vast rural areas, just talking to a man who is not a close relative can be punishable by death. And in some places, girls are routinely married at puberty. And now, preserving any protections long-term appears to be in question, as the country's tiny women's rights movement faces an unenviable decision: leave intact the only law that attempts to halt such abuses, or continue to present changes to Parliament and run the risk that a growing conservative bloc could dismantle the law entirely. The quandary became evident on Saturday, when a bid to add more robust protections was rapidly withdrawn in Parliament after stinging rebukes. Angry mullahs and conservatives who never supported the law in the first place complained that it and the proposed revisions were un-Islamic and asked who could better decide than they who and when their daughters should marry. Some women in Parliament were not supportive either, citing the measure's backing of shelters for battered women. Many Afghans believe shelters are little better than brothels and tarnish a girl's reputation. To cut off the onslaught, the proposal was sent back to committee, its future uncertain. The push to bring up the law in Parliament has split the small group of Afghan women's rights advocates. Despite fears of the conservatives, some argued that quick action had to be taken before the exit of the United States, which, along with the European Union, has championed better lives and protections for Afghan women. But others resisted. ''We know who is in the Parliament,'' said Soraya Sobrang, a women's rights activist and part of a hastily organized effort to stop the law from coming up in Parliament, referring to the former militia commanders, mullahs and other conservatives who take a dim view of many Western-backed protections for women. What would stop them, she asked, ''from pulling a list from their back pocket'' of changes that would weaken the protections against child marriage or even rape? The drive to amend the law was led by one of Afghanistan's more visible champions for women's issues: Fawzia Koofi, a determined, ambitious woman who gained a seat in Parliament in 2005 and in 2010, survived an attempt on her life by gunmen thought to be Taliban. ''There is a step back on women's issues,'' Ms. Koofi said, explaining her drive to revise the law in the plenary session of Parliament this weekend. ''The government used to be more supportive.'' Ms. Koofi is a somewhat controversial figure. Closely allied with the predominantly Tajik former Northern Alliance faction in Parliament, she has sometimes been criticized as pursuing policies for her own political gain. However, she insisted that her motivation to amend the women's law was to help solidify it, though not all supporters of women's rights here agree. Ms. Koofi said the proposed changes would allow the government to prosecute cases of abuse even when the woman who had been abused withdrew her claim. Women frequently come under family pressure to drop complaints of domestic violence. Ms. Koofi said she also added a provision prohibiting sexual harassment, calling it increasingly pervasive as more women go to work in offices. And, she said, she included a provision to require men to pay women child support if they leave them or take other wives. No written version of the amendments was publicly available, so it was difficult to verify their contents or wording. The law -- the Elimination of Violence Against Women Act -- was issued in 2009 as a decree by President Hamid Karzai. In a first for the country, it outlined basic protections from practices common throughout Afghanistan, including child marriage, forced marriage, physical abuse and the practice of giving women in marriage to settle disputes between families, called baad. Ms. Koofi said her prime worry was that, with elections due in less than a year, the law might be annulled by a new president. Parliament's endorsement would enshrine it more securely, she argued. ''If we wait for the best moment when there is no opposition, we will wait forever,'' she said. ''Our worry is that things will get worse after 2014, and there's no guarantee that the next president will support the women's issues. We should have done it even earlier.'' Women who opposed Ms. Koofi's gambit said they were resigned that it might already be too late to do more in Parliament than safeguard the current law. ''It's gambling with the law with this kind of Parliament,'' said Mahbooba Saraj, a women's advocate who joined a news conference at the offices of the Afghan Women's Network, one of the larger women's rights organizations here, to urge that Parliament remove discussion of the act from its agenda this weekend. ''It's a gamble with the lives of Afghan women.'' Last week, the Afghan Women's Network, along with a number of Kabul-based civil society organizations, began sending out alarmed e-mails to embassies and international organizations, as well as reporters, to rally opposition to the effort to revise the law. Western diplomats in Kabul also strongly advised Ms. Koofi not to push ahead with a full debate unless she was absolutely sure that the law could be protected from evisceration. Georgette Gagnon, the head of the human rights office for the United Nations here, who has studied how the law has been carried out, described taking the measure before the Parliament as ''fraught with all kinds of risk.'' ''Ultimately, the losers could be millions of Afghan women,'' she said. The existing law is far from ideal. Human rights lawyers say it lacks a definition of honor crimes and offers little clarity on how the police or prosecutors should treat a woman who runs away from home to escape violence. Often a woman who flees is imprisoned on charges that she intended to commit adultery; numerous women interviewed in jails by the United Nations for its 2012 report on the law's enforcement said they left home to avoid a forced marriage or domestic violence. And women come under enormous family pressure to drop any charge of domestic violence. Enforcement remains woefully insufficient: in the first full year that the law was put into effect, from 2010 to 2011, courts relied on it in just 4 percent of the 2,299 reported episodes that could be defined as crimes under the measure, according to a November 2011 report by the United Nations human rights division. However, prosecutors have begun to use the law, especially in the larger urban areas like Kabul and Herat, and human rights groups hope that as prosecutors become familiar with it, they will rely on it more frequently. At a minimum, the law provides a basic set of protections for women that prosecutors, judges, lawyers for women and women's advocates can look to in determining whether prosecutable abuses have occurred. ''The potential risk of opening this Pandora's box is enormous,'' said Heather Barr, the director of the Human Rights Watch office for Afghanistan, referring to the risks inherent in letting the full Parliament reconsider each provision. ''Just look at a photograph of the Parliament. What planet would you have to be on to think that they would vote to send themselves to prison if they married off their under-aged daughter, or send themselves to jail if they beat their wives?''",2013,"Afghanistan"
"250","Afghan Students Protest Women's Rights Decree","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Hard-line Islamist students protested in the Afghan capital on Wednesday, demanding the repeal of a presidential decree for women's rights that they say is un-Islamic. It was the latest sign of a backlash against the legal protections passed in the 12 years since the toppling of the Taliban government known for its harsh treatment of women. The protest came days after conservative lawmakers' vehement opposition blocked an attempt to cement the decree's provisions in legislation. Most of the international force that ousted the Taliban is now preparing to withdraw by the end of next year, and activists fear an erosion of women's rights will follow if hard-liners pressure the elected government. More than 200 male students protested in front of Kabul University on Wednesday against the decree on Elimination of Violence Against Women, which includes a ban on child marriage and forced marriage, makes domestic violence a crime and says rape victims cannot be prosecuted for adultery. It also outlaws ''ba'ad,'' a traditional practice of exchanging women or girls to settle disputes or debts. A protester, Fazel Hadi, 25, said the decree was ''imposed by foreigners'' and violated Shariah law. President Hamid Karzai issued the decree three years ago as part of a raft of commitments to international donors, but the lawmaker and activist Fawzia Kofi wanted to pass it in Parliament to prevent any future president from reversing it.",2013,"Afghanistan"
"251","Despite West's Efforts, Afghan Youths Cling to Traditional Ways","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Walk through the streets of Kabul and evidence of the West's decade-long war literally clings to the Afghan youth: the American labels emblazoned on their shirts and jeans, the stylish sunglasses they wear, the cellphones they clutch to update their lives on Twitter and Facebook. To those who like to think that the foreign presence here has left more than spent shells and hollowed-out buildings, what the young people of Kabul wear and value can itself offer a sense of comfort. These trappings of the West, the hope goes, belong to a generation ready to embrace women's rights, democracy and other ideals that America and its allies have spent billions of dollars trying to instill. But interviews with dozens of Afghan youth paint a picture of a new generation bound to their society's conservative ways, especially when it comes to women's rights, one of the West's single most important efforts here. Attempts to alter women's roles in society remain controversial among the younger generation, perhaps the starkest example of the West's limited influence as coalition forces prepare to withdraw next year. ''If someone thinks that youngsters have changed, they should think twice,'' said Amina Mustaqim Jawid, the director of the Afghan Women's Coalition Against Corruption. ''These young men grew up in a war environment. They don't know about their own rights; how can we expect them to know about their sisters' rights, their mothers' rights or their wives' rights? If they wear jeans and have Western haircuts, that doesn't mean they are progressive.'' Even in Kabul, one of the most liberal cities in Afghanistan, many young men and women express beliefs that fly in the face of the messages coming from American Embassy outreach efforts. Censorship, particularly when it comes to religious offenses, summons little ire. Many consider democracy a tool of the West. And the vast majority of Afghans still rely on tribal justice, viewing the courts as little more than venues of extortion. On a recent afternoon, young women gathered on the third floor of a wedding hall, enduring the stifling heat in black niqabs to protest a recently proposed law aimed at protecting the rights of Afghan women. The men remained outside, forming a barricade along the busy street to prevent strangers from entering the hall. One poster read, ''I am a Self-Aware Woman, I Will Not Be Deceived by the Empty Slogans of the West.'' ''This law is not only against Islamic values; it is also against all other ethical values,'' one protester, Saida Hafiz, said to a crowd of about 200 young women and children assembled in the room. ''If we remain silent today, soon our society will be morally corrupted like that of the West.'' Such impressions can be heard throughout the city: in the shared street taxis that cart Kabulis across town, in the bustling cafes of the city's sparkling Shar-e Naw neighborhood, even on the campuses of the nation's most prestigious universities. Group taxi rides, which serve as Kabul's de facto bus system, offer an unfiltered view of the local perspective. On board, men of all ages speak openly about everything from politics to traffic -- often in the presence of women. On a recent evening, a crowd idled downtown along Enhesarat Street, waiting for cars and minivans amid a cacophony of horns and engines. A few men piled into a dusty minivan headed for Taimani 2, an area in West Kabul. As the minivan lurched along the pockmarked roads, they chatted about a recent shoe-throwing fight between two female parliamentarians. ''Who let these women into Parliament?'' said an old man with red hair and blue eyes, his knees pressed against his chest. ''Women were meant to stay at home.'' A young man seated beside him, holding books on his lap and dressed in a blue T-shirt and gray pants, nodded in agreement. On another trip, from the neighborhood of Kolola Pushta back downtown, a similar scene unfolded. A young student from the Afghan-Korea Vocational Institute, dressed in a blazer and slacks, brought up a recent Western public art project, where young men and women doled out pink balloons to passers-by. ''Did you see what those girls were wearing?'' he asked another passenger, citing the women's short sleeves and fitted pants. ''If my sister dressed like that, I would kill her.'' Protests proliferated in the days after the bill concerning women's rights was introduced. Though lawmakers almost immediately blocked it, given the outcry from religious leaders, supporters promised to reintroduce the legislation, setting off a wave of debate. The measure would essentially cement rights that have ostensibly been in place through presidential decree for several years -- including protections against child marriage, polygamy and violence against women. About 200 male students flooded the gates of Kabul University, the nation's most prestigious public university, calling for an end to the bill and the presidential decree. Gathered with a small group of friends after the protest, which he did not attend, Mohammad Taib, 19, said the draft was in conflict with Islam. ''Those who are pushing for the approval of the law, they are doing it to make Westerners happy,'' Mr. Taib said. ''Those with independent ideas are strictly against it.'' His friend Mohammad Haroun, added: ''I believe in women's rights, but in strict accordance with Islam.'' In reality, a lot of what is thought to be Shariah law in Afghanistan is actually tribal tradition. Some of the most severe cultural practices, like the selling of young girls to pay off debt, are elements of Pashtun code that would be unacceptable in most other Islamic countries. ''That's a huge problem,'' said Din Mohammad Gran, the dean of Kabul University's Shariah law school, who does not support the women's rights bill. ''Some people have a misinterpretation of Islam that they learned from the wrong sources.'' While conservative voices are easy enough to find in and around the capital, Kabul is not without its progressive pockets. Groups like Afghanistan 1400, a collection of young Afghan leaders committed to social and political change, are often cited as the vanguard of civic activism. Corporate workplaces have also become surprising petri dishes for quiet activism. At Tolonews, one of the country's largest television news organizations, men find themselves working for women as economic realities scuttle normal social dynamics. This, in part, reflects what some observers say is the chasm between the public and private behavior of many Afghans, who are not as conservative as they seem. ''Our traditions and conventions are telling us one thing, and the realities on the ground are telling us something else,'' said Saad Mohseni, the founder of Tolonews. ''People are actually acting in a very different way from how they are talking.'' Some young Afghan women have taken the issue head-on, opting to speak out publicly for their rights. While they know their struggle lies along the outer edge of the accepted social protests for women, activists like Noor Jahan Akbar have adopted the long view. ''After 30 years of war, what do you expect?'' asked Ms. Akbar, a young blogger who helped organize a recent demonstration supporting the bill. ''A mind-set built over 100 years takes longer than 10 years to change.'' Ms. Akbar and about 100 other women and a handful of men began their protest one morning near the entrance to the Afghan Parliament, shouting slogans from a megaphone and carting banners. As the day wore on, whispers circulated that the Shariah law students were coming to violently upend the protest. Police officers massed along the periphery, their battering rods and plastic shields raised. Suddenly, hundreds of men emerged from behind the police, shouting chants and carrying banners. The crowd easily eclipsed Ms. Akbar's protesters, snarling traffic along the road. But these demonstrators were not focused on women's rights. They were riled up in support of a Kabul University dean accused of mistreating minority students. Even as the women spoke out, these masses marched past, largely oblivious to their words.",2013,"Afghanistan"
"252","Jimmy Carter Plans Book on Women","MENA","Jimmy Carter, whose prolific postpresidential career as an author has covered aging, his Southern boyhood and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, is now tackling the treatment of women. According to a book proposal that has circulated among several major publishers in the last week, Mr. Carter plans to write a 50,000-word book about ''all aspects of women's lives'' that explores the unequal treatment of women around the world and the use of religious texts to justify discrimination. The book proposal, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, was sent to publishers by Lynn Nesbit, the literary agent whose clients include Joan Didion and Robert A. Caro. ''I am convinced that discrimination against women and girls is one of the world's most serious, all-pervasive and largely ignored violations of basic human rights,'' Mr. Carter, 88, wrote in the proposal, adding: ''It is disturbing to realize that women are treated most equally in some countries that are atheistic or where governments are strictly separated from religion.'' Mr. Carter, who has traveled the world as an author and human rights activist since the end of his presidency, said he would rely on many of his own experiences as fodder for the book. ''Whenever possible, I'll use my personal observations and experiences, such as a trip around Africa with Bill Gates Sr. and his wife,'' Mr. Carter wrote, ''during which he and I spent much of our time in enormous brothels, and appeared with Nelson Mandela to end South Africa's practice of outlawing treatment for H.I.V.-AIDS.'' Mr. Carter wrote in the proposal that he had been asked to write the book by a ''wide coalition'' of religious leaders. He has also solicited contributions from women's activists for the book. Women's rights was the subject of a recent speech in Atlanta by Mr. Carter, who spoke out against mistreatment of women and girls. Ms. Nesbit did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

The report names the forms of violence, including infanticide, domestic abuse, dowry deaths, genital mutilation, sex selection and commercial sexual exploitation. The report notes that such forms of violence are self-reinforcing within families and societies, fostering tolerance. Perhaps when all societies enforce legislation that criminalizes gender bias and when girls and women are empowered, through education, to be active agents in insuring their human rights, situations of violence against women, like that created by the Taliban, will receive zero tolerance.

"254","Do More for Rights In Saudi Arabia","MENA","To the Editor: Re ""Saudi Heir Urges Reform, and Turn from U.S."" (front page, Dec. 4): The Saudi government's recent ratification of several international human rights conventions is a good beginning, but the provisions of these treaties must now be fully carried out. For example, although Crown Prince Abdullah signed the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in September, Saudi Arabia still needs to provide basic protection for women. Abuse of female domestic workers from developing countries remains widespread, and women in general are extremely vulnerable to intimidation or abuse in police stations when male officers press them for confessions. Concrete and visible steps to carry out the conventions they have signed would demonstrate to the world and, more important, to the people of Saudi Arabia, that Crown Prince Abdullah and his government take their commitment to human rights seriously.

"255","A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FIRST LADY; Mrs. Bush Cites Women's Plight Under Taliban","MENA","Laura Bush took over her husband's weekly radio address today to urge worldwide condemnation of the treatment of women in Afghanistan, and to ensure that they have rights and can contribute when that country is rebuilt. ""Afghan women know, through hard experience, what the rest of the world is discovering: the brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists,"" Mrs. Bush said from Crawford, Tex., where she and President Bush are spending Thanksgiving. ""Civilized people throughout the world are speaking out in horror -- not only because our hearts break for the women and children in Afghanistan, but also because in Afghanistan, we see the world the terrorists would like to impose on the rest of us,"" Mrs. Bush said. Administration officials said Mrs. Bush's speech, apparently the first solo performance by a first lady in the weekly presidential radio address, was the beginning of an international campaign to call attention to the oppression of women and children under the Taliban. The radio talk coincided with the release by the State Department today of a report on ""the Taliban's war against women,"" which noted that, before the rise of the Taliban, women held a high percentage of professional jobs and government posts in Afghanistan. ""The Taliban regime began its systematic repression of all sectors of the population soon after taking control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, in 1996,"" the report said. ""The Taliban's war against women, however, is particularly appalling."" In depriving girls and women of education and freedom, the Taliban has decreed a joyless, fear-filled existence, the report said. Moreover, it said, ""The Taliban has stripped a society in desperate need of trained professionals of half its assets."" The State Department document contains numerous vignettes of bleak everyday life, including one from Nageeba, a 35-year-old Kabul widow. ""The life of Afghan women is so bad,"" she said. ""We are locked at home and cannot see the sun."" The report can be read on the State Department's Web site: www.state.gov. Vice President Dick Cheney and other administration officials are expected to address the status of Afghan women, and their role in a post-Taliban society, over the next several days. Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, is to deliver the same message. On Thursday, Congress approved a measure authorizing President Bush to use emergency funds made available after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for schooling and health care for Afghan women and children. At the moment, Mrs. Bush said, many Afghan people suffer from hunger. ""Seventy percent of the Afghan people are malnourished,"" she said. ""One in every four children won't live past the age of 5 because health care is not available."" Mrs. Bush said Muslims around the world have condemned the Taliban's attitudes. ""Only the terrorists and the Taliban forbid education to women,"" she said. ""Only the terrorists and the Taliban threaten to pull out women's fingernails for wearing nail polish."" Neither the first lady nor the State Department report mentioned that, to many Westerners, some Muslim attitudes toward women seem chauvinistic and out of place. And Amnesty International issued a statement today asserting that the Northern Alliance have also oppressed women and should not be allowed to dictate their place in a new Afghan society. The State Department report noted that the governments of Indonesia and Bangladesh are headed by women. ""Women have the right to vote in Muslim countries such as Qatar, Iran and Bahrain,"" the department said. ""Throughout the Muslim world, women fill countless positions as doctors, teachers, journalists, judges, business people, diplomats and other professionals."" The report conceded that ""societies differ among themselves on the status of women and the roles they should play."" Nevertheless, it said, ""Islam is a religion that respects women and humanity. The Taliban respects neither.""",2001,"Afghanistan"
"256","Liberties; Cleopatra and Osama","MENA","It is hard to fathom how a part of the world that produced Cleopatra -- who perfumed the sails of her boat so men would know she was coming and ruled with elegant authority, signing one tax decree ""Make it happen"" -- could two millenniums later produce societies where women are swaddled breeders under house arrest. When civilization rose in the East, it was scientific and sensual, embracing the possibilities and pleasures of life from mathematics to literature, art and fashion. There have been many repressive regimes throughout history. But the Taliban were obsessively focused on denying gender, sexuality and the forces at the very gut of life. When the barbarian puritans running Afghanistan began to scurry away last week, men raced to buy pin-ups of beautiful girls. And, in a moving and amazing tableau, some women unwrapped themselves, letting the sun shine on their faces as they smiled shyly and delightedly. A few dared to show a little ankle or put on high heels. ""Your head hurts and your eyes hurt from the limited vision,"" one young woman in Kabul told a reporter, discarding her despised burka. ""It was very difficult to walk without falling over."" (Most have held off burning burkas because, as one woman put it, ""They say the Taliban beat first and asked questions afterward. They say the Northern Alliance asks questions first and beats afterward."") In a real version of Margaret Atwood's creepy ""Handmaid's Tale,"" the Taliban reduced women to vessels designed to serve the needs and bolster the status of men. ""I agree that a kind of religion motivates the Taliban, but the religion in question, I'd say, is not Islam,"" Robert McElvaine, a history professor, wrote in The Washington Post. It is ""insecure masculinity. These men are terrified of women."" Afghan warlords have long used castration to torture foes. The hijackers were haywire about women. Some draped towels over the prints of 20's bathing beauties in pantaloons in a Florida motel room; others indulged in lap dances, strip clubs and prostitutes, keeping busy until they got their bounty of 70 virgins. Mohamed Atta's will had loopy, misogynistic instructions: ""I don't want a pregnant woman or a person who is not clean to come and say goodbye to me"" and ""I don't want any women to go to my grave."" The White House, suddenly shocked by five-year-old Taliban excesses, began a campaign against their treatment of women. ""Only the terrorists and the Taliban threaten to pull out women's fingernails for wearing nail polish,"" Laura Bush said, taking over her husband's weekly radio address. Bush aides say the campaign will try to influence the Northern Alliance to restore women's rights and press for women in the Afghan government. Of course, they also want to impress U.S. women, who preferred Gore to Bush by 11 points. It's a freebie, an easy way to please feminists who got mad when the administration ended financing for international family-planning groups that support abortion. This belated promotion of women as a moderating, modernizing force in the Islamic world sounds hollow. Bush senior went to war to liberate Kuwait, yet America has not made a fuss over the fact that Kuwaiti women still can't vote or initiate divorce proceedings. We also turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's treating women like chattel. There are 5,000 Saudi princes, but where are the princesses? The Saudi religious police, the matawain, use sticks to make sure women hide beneath their abayas, the long black cloaks. Besides having to put up with polygamy, Saudi women cannot marry outside Islam, while men can. Or divorce without cause, as men can. Women also have to use separate banks and schools and obtain written permission from a male relative before traveling alone or going to a hospital. They must sit in the back seats of the cars they are not allowed to drive. (American military women stationed there are angry that they have to wear abayas and sit in the back seat when they leave the base.) But the Bushes love that royal family and its oil. What does it matter if Saudi women can drive, as long as American women can keep driving their S.U.V.'s? Millions of Muslim women are still considered property. The first lady might think about extending her campaign beyond Afghanistan.",2001,"Afghanistan"
"257","A NATION CHALLENGED: WOMEN'S RIGHTS; Relief Groups Seek a Peacekeeping Force for Afghanistan","MENA","Human rights organizations urged today that an international military force be sent soon to Afghanistan to prevent chaos and bloodshed and ease the way to a post-Taliban government more fair to women. If a stabilizing force under United Nations auspices is not deployed in Afghanistan, there is a high risk that the country will be torn apart by the factional violence that has marked its recent history, the International Rescue Committee and the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children said today. The organizations said that an armed force was vital to ensure that aid was distributed without interruption and that the country did not relapse into bloodshed, and to promote the rights of women in whatever new Afghanistan emerged. ""Recent events have finally opened the door to a restoration of the rights of Afghan women,"" Mary Diaz, the executive director of the women's commission, said at a news conference. ""It would be a tragic loss if this opportunity were not fully supported by the international community and women were once again forced to hide behind the burka out of fear for their safety."" The oppression of women by the Taliban has been well documented. But Darla Silva, a staff attorney for the women's group, said that the Taliban's arch-enemy, the Northern Alliance, ""does not have a good record on women's rights either."" Ms. Silva said that the women's commission, an advocacy group based in New York City, wanted United States officials and leaders of other governments to pressure the Northern Alliance on women's rights. ""Otherwise, there is the risk of systematic oppression,"" she said. Mark Bartolini of the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit relief organization, said the rapid collapse of the Taliban in the face of the American-led campaign had created both opportunity and danger. There was a chance to make a better Afghanistan, but a danger that the country would be torn by internal rivalries before a stable government could take root, he said. Northern Alliance soldiers entered Kabul last week despite United States requests to stay outside the Afghan capital. On Monday, the alliance agreed to take part in a conference on forming a provisional government that would represent the ethnic groups that make up the alliance, as well as Pashtun groups in the south. Mr. Bartolini said that it might be difficult to construct a fair, representative Afghan government, but it could be done. ""The country had a functioning society,"" he said, recalling the days before the Soviet occupation and the internal fighting that followed the Soviet withdrawal. Ms. Diaz said the rival factions in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan ""have a history of rape and abuse against civilians."" The collapse of the Taliban had spawned more violence in some regions, she said. ""The women's commission urges the international community to install a peacekeeping force in Afghanistan to allow the development of a coalition government that allows the full participation in civil society of all people, regardless of sex or ethnicity,"" Ms. Diaz said. She said the Northern Alliance groups should be pressured on their policies toward women and their commitment to international laws protecting them. Otherwise, she said, there is the prospect of ""duplication of the systematic oppression carried out by the Taliban."" ""Women and girls are tasting freedom for the first time in many years,"" she said, ""but to be truly free, they need peace.""",2001,"Afghanistan"
"258","A NATION CHALLENGED: U.N. TALKS; Delegate Seeks Larger Role For Women","MENA","The sole woman who will represent the Northern Alliance at the United Nations-sponsored talks on Afghanistan said today that she hoped women would be able to play a more prominent role in Afghan society in the post-Taliban era. ""My hope is that Afghan women will become active in all social areas and can show their ability as managers,"" said Amina Safi Afzali, one of the alliance's 11 delegates to the talks near Bonn that are to start on Tuesday. Ms. Afzali, 43, speaking by telephone from Iran's northeast city of Mashhad, near the Afghan border, said she saw the meeting as a historic occasion for her war-torn country even though women's issues would not be at the top of the agenda. ""The Bonn conference will discuss the future of the Afghan nation, be they men or women,"" she said. ""Although women's issues may not be covered, this meeting will decide the political future of Afghanistan, of which women are a part. ""I have fought for 20 years for Afghan women's rights, and tried to show the world how oppressed they are. Maybe that is one of the reasons that I was chosen as the only woman to attend the Bonn conference."" Ms. Afzali's husband, a mujahedeen commander, was killed fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan 14 years ago. After taking control of Kabul in 1996, the Taliban issued edicts in line with their austere vision of Islam, which forbade women to work outside the home, attend school and leave their homes unless accompanied by a male relative. Women were also forced to wear burkas, head-to-toe veils. ""We respect the Islamic dress code, but what the Taliban imposed on Afghan women, such as wearing the burka, is based only on the Taliban's Islam,"" she said. She spoke approvingly of a demonstration on Tuesday in which hundreds of women, shedding their burkas, gathered in the Afghan capital, Kabul, to demand their rights. ""About the demonstration in Kabul, I can say that women are right not to accept a stone-age dress code which the Taliban forced them to follow,"" she said, speaking hours before leaving for the talks.",2001,"Afghanistan"
"259","A NATION CHALLENGED: RIGHTS; In Bonn, Three Champions for Afghan Women","MENA","Sima Wali left Afghanistan 23 years ago when the Soviet Army swept into her country. Afghanistan was thrown into a downward spiral of violence, rivalry, civil war and harsh religious rule that finally forced Afghan women out of public life, jobs and education. ""In these 23 years, Afghan women have had to fight their own jihad for peace and equality,"" Ms. Wali said. ""It was a jihad, really. But it has also politicized Afghan women, even from behind the veil."" Ms. Wali, who settled in the United States and has worked to better the lives of Afghan women, is one of three women taking part as delegates in the United Nations talks here on a provisional government for post-Taliban Afghanistan. She and Rona Mansuri, who came to Germany in the 1960's when her father was Afghanistan's ambassador here, are delegates from the so-called Rome group, loyal to Afghanistan's former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah. Before he was deposed by a cousin in 1973 and moved to Rome, the king, now 87, ruled an Afghanistan in which women had important public roles as legislators and ambassadors. Under a 1964 Constitution, women were granted the right to work. Four then served as cabinet ministers and two others were members of the National Assembly -- a move into public life that accelerated during the 1979-89 Soviet occupation, when many women wore Western dress. Under Burhanuddin Rabbani, the titular head of the Northern Alliance who was president before the Taliban took over, women had to be accompanied by male relatives in public under restored old laws enforced by the new Islamic police. But under the Taliban, who took power in 1996, the status of women plunged. Education for those over 8 was banned and women were forced out of public life and jobs. Many were beaten for exposing their faces and some were publicly executed after accusations of sexual misconduct. The popularity of the former king now is partly the sense of a lost idyll, before Afghanistan spun apart. But Ms. Mansuri and Ms. Wali are using their positions to go beyond a return to the past. They are here to argue for women to take full and responsible roles in any future Afghan government -- and for the reaffirmation and protection of women's rights to equality. ""We are not waiting any longer to be invited to sit at these tables where peace is being discussed and the reconstruction of our economy,"" Ms. Wali said. ""We are the silent voices that need to be heard."" Pressure from the United Nations and the West, including the United States, was vital to get women as delegates here, Ms. Wali said. But now that she is in the room where the decisions are being made, she said, ""I'm a constant presence to raise the issue of women."" A third woman, Amena Safi Afzali, an exile now living in Iran, represents the Northern Alliance. Requests to interview her were not answered. Another exile, Fatima Gailani, is an adviser to the Peshawar group, who are mostly Pashtun. She comes from a prominent Afghan family, is the sister of the delegation's head, Sayed Hamed Gailani, and is married to another member of the delegation. She has studied Islamic law to better defend the rights of women, she says. She is articulate and open and not shy about her interest in a serious job in a new government. But she is realistic as well. ""If I go to Afghanistan today and ask women for votes on the promise to bring them secularism, they are going to tell me to go to hell,"" she said. ""So I will not say that. I will tell them that I would work for equal rights with men under an Islamic constitution. We can work from there."" Ms. Wali, the director of Refugee Women in Development, based in Washington, is also a founder of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute based in Montreal. She is an organizer of a conference on Afghan women scheduled to open in Brussels on Dec. 4. Ms. Wali persuaded both King Zahir and Mr. Rabbani to sign statements two weeks ago supporting the right of women to a full role in Afghanistan's political future. The most egregious restrictions on women are being relaxed in Kabul. Still, Ms. Wali is cautious about Mr. Rabbani's commitment to defend the rights of women ""within the context of Islam,"" she said. The statements must be backed by action, she said. She also appealed to Western women to understand that the real problems of Afghan women are ""extreme poverty and the number of widows who have no means to sustain themselves,"" cautioning that Afghans would not immediately strip off their veils and take full roles in public life. It is also important, she said, that ""Western women respect the right of Afghan women to choice, including the choice of keeping their chadors and burkas."" The Afghan women here got support today from some European Union legislators, who talked to the delegates about the importance of women's rights and called on their own governments to ensure a new Afghanistan that is open to everyone. ""Let us hope to see each member of the military forces followed by a teacher and a health worker,"" they said in a ""European women's declaration"" on these talks. When one of the legislators, Britt Theorin of Sweden, who heads the Equality Commission of the European Parliament, told the Afghan delegations that 40 percent of the seats in government should be held by women, she said, ""the women smiled, but the men said nothing."" Another European legislator, Emma Bonino of Italy, announced a one-day fast on Dec. 1 to support women in Afghanistan, and said that over 5,000 people from more than 100 countries had already agreed to take part. As for Ms. Wali, she said she intended to take part fully in Afghan political life. ""I've been working for the rights of Afghan women for 22 years,"" she said, ""and I do not intend to stop the struggle now.""",2001,"Afghanistan"
"260","Istanbul Journal; Campus Crowd Shrugs At Marital-Equality Law","MENA","Lounging on the grassy square in the heart of the prestigious Bosporus University campus here, Selen Yenmez, a silver stud pinned to her nose, a Jimi Hendrix button pinned to her bag, could muster only scant enthusiasm for a new Turkish law that offers equality to a husband and wife. ""It's a little late,"" Ms. Yenmez, 18, said flatly. ""It should have been done before."" The new law, which accords women equal property rights in a divorce and allows men to seek alimony, makes Turkish family law among the most equitable anywhere in the world -- not to mention in the Islamic world. But as Ms. Yenmez saw it, it will not much affect her own life. In her circle, she said, young men and women already consider themselves equal, and when her own parents were divorced, they split their property equitably. It just might, she said, make a difference to women from more traditional families, although they are mired in customs hard to break. ""It's like there are two parts of Turkey,"" she said. The chasms in the lives of Turkish women run deep -- between the schooled and unschooled, the cosmopolitans and the recent migrants from the countryside, the secularists and the Islamists. Just like Turkey itself -- a majority Muslim country and a secular state -- women here repeatedly tangle with the clashing impulses brought by tradition and greater Westernization. To the Western eye, the social mores on faith and sex here can sometimes seem like an inconsistent jumble. On the campus of elite Bosporus University, for instance, head scarves are banned. But stand at the school gates one morning and you will easily witness the quiet rebellion of young women against the official secularism of the state. University women walk in with wigs, hiding their real hair. Or they wear a fashionable floppy hat over the head scarves, the better to dupe the guards at the gate. Just the other day, recalled Ms. Yenmez, a first-year sociology major, she was on the university shuttle with a woman wearing a hat. As soon as the shuttle crossed into the campus gates, the woman removed her hat, revealing a carefully tied head scarf for all to see. Among women who cover, some wear what is sometimes referred to here as ""the uniform"" -- a bland combination of a long solid-colored coat and a scarf tied in the Islamic custom. But take a nighttime stroll along the Istiklal, the city's main party drag, and you will notice covered women with brightly painted lips, black leather boots as spiky as minarets, hip-hugging jeans. You can see covered women (and remember, to cover is a sign of modesty) making out with their boyfriends on the promenade. If it seems befuddling to the outsider, said Feride Acar, chairwoman of political science at the Middle Eastern Technical University in Ankara, that is because transitions are often befuddling. ""This is a society that's very dynamic,"" Ms. Acar said. ""It is a social transition for these individuals, and a social transition for Turkey, from a more traditional, more closed type of living to a more open, more modern, more liberal type of existence."" The head scarf has been banned in government buildings since the founding of the Turkish Republic, in 1926. Today, women who cover, especially among those in their 20's and 30's, are a distinct minority. Women's suffrage came in 1930, four years after the founding of the modern state. There are women in politics (with the notable exception of women who cannot, by law, sit in Parliament with their scarves on) and on the streets of Istanbul, women drink, smoke and carouse late into the night. Divorce is increasing among urban women, but it remains rare and stigmatized in the countryside. Against this backdrop comes the new civil code. The change, passed by Parliament last week, puts Turkish women's rights on a par with most of Western Europe, which is, as some see it, why the Parliament was persuaded to pass it. Turkey has been eager to join the European Union, a bid not assisted by the old civil code, which declared a man as the head of the household. Under that old system, said Canan Arin, a lawyer long pushing for the changes, ""Women would have only their underwear and probably their children and no money."" The new law gives women equal dibs on shared property in the event of a divorce. Still unresolved is the question of whether the law will apply retroactively -- in other words, to what Ms. Arin estimates to be the 17 million Turkish women who are already married. On the Bosporus University campus, several young women said they had hardly paid attention to the change in the law. There were exams to think about, a social life to ponder, the grim prospects of life in Turkey's latest economic crisis. Sitting on a bench, poring over notes, two first-year women offered only a quizzical look when asked about the law. A few yards away, a young man with a mop of curls falling to his shoulders munched on pizza and shrugged. ""It's not a major issue,"" Emre Tuzer, 19, a second-year international trade major, said. ""Right now, people are concerned about what's in their wallet."" His friends, sprawled on the grass, said they were skeptical about whether the law would change the circumstances of women in more traditional families than their own. ""Still, women will be afraid to divorce,"" Deniz Saltukoglu, 18, said, ""because of social problems, because of how people will see them."" ""The change is legal,"" her friend, Naz Sunay, 18, offered. ""But it won't be able to change the family system.""",2001,"Turkey"
"261","A NATION CHALLENGED: ISLAM; Where Muslim Traditions Meet Modernity","MENA","Islam preaches equality, yet in most Muslim countries a woman's place is determined by a man's will. It's the law. A husband can prevent his wife from traveling abroad, and the police will back up his legal right to stop her. A father can marry off his daughter against her will, and she, by law, must obey. A woman is trapped in a loveless marriage; with few exceptions, her husband is free once he declares himself divorced. But the days when Muslim women could be kept housebound, cosseted and remote from society are long gone in most parts of the Muslim world. As modernity collides with religious tradition, women have begun to demand a reinterpretation of the civil codes that presume a woman, in her private life, is a capricious creature in need of a man's guiding hand. The agitation in countries like Morocco is coming from female scholars who are confident of their religious judgment and use the Internet as a forum to promote an alternative vision of the rights of Muslim women. It is coming, as well, from politically active women who push for change from within Islamist movements. It is coming from ordinary women who fear that legal strictures will prevent their countries from integrating into the modern world. Their challenges to Islamic orthodoxy have placed these women at the heart of the main political battle in the Muslim world, where one side claims Islam as a shield against foreign culture and the other presents it as a road map for progress. To the extent there is public debate over the role of Islam -- as armor or emancipator -- that debate often turns on the subject of women. For many Muslim women, the religious laws that subordinate them to the authority of male relatives represent a final frontier. They already vote, unless they live in the gulf nations. They go to school, unless they lived under Taliban rule in Afghanistan. They choose whether or not to wear a veil, unless they live in Iran or Saudi Arabia. But in the personal sphere, laws remain mired in patriarchal tradition and a medieval reading of Islam. To alter them, Muslim women face not only an entrenched religious establishment, but also a battle with fundamentalists in the political arena. Many Muslim women say they do not want instructions for their struggle from the West. As they demonstrated at many international conferences on women's rights, they resent being told what it is they need. Still, in many countries, Islamist movements have attacked those seeking change as Western stooges and enemies of Islam, and they have seized on resistance to women's rights as an issue in their power struggle with moderate Muslim rulers. In Kuwait, Islamist members of Parliament rejected the emir's efforts to grant voting rights to women and pushed through a law to segregate Kuwait University. In Jordan, Islamists have campaigned successfully against the king's attempt to stiffen penalties for honor killings, or the murder of women whose behavior is deemed shameful to family honor. Nowhere in the Islamic world does the conflict over women's rights come into sharper relief than in Morocco, where society has split in two over a government proposal to eliminate inequities in the kingdom's laws. Last year, in a remarkable public demonstration, more than 400,000 people took to the streets in response to the plan. Half of them, marching in Rabat, supported the plan for equal rights. The other half, in Casablanca, rallied against it as an attack on religious values. The most contentious part of the proposal concerned the country's personal-status law, or moudawana, and the debate has become as much a political battle as a discussion of women's rights. The plan would raise the legal age for marriage to 18 from 15 for women (as it already is for men), outlaw polygamy in most cases and allow divorced women for the first time to retain custody of their children if they remarry. Women would also be granted equal rights to ask for a divorce and equal claims to assets acquired during the marriage, rather than just their personal property. Invasion of Ideas An Islamist dissident group, Justice and Spirituality, has organized the campaign against the plan. Led by Abdessalam Yassine, who accuses ""Westernized elites"" of destroying the Muslim world and its culture, the once-clandestine group has cast itself as the only line of defense against an invasion of foreign ideas. ""It's not that we don't want women to evolve,"" said Nadia Yassine, the leader's daughter and a spokeswoman. ""But we can't accept a plan simply because Westernized women with a Western mentality proposed it."" Under Moroccan law, a man can divorce his wife by simply declaring it in front of a judge. A woman is entitled to file for divorce only if she can prove her husband abuses her or fails to support her. Otherwise, she must buy her way out of a marriage by paying her husband any amount of money he demands. Unlike Mrs. Yassine, who said the moudawana does need adjustment, other Moroccan Islamists denounced the proposals as a threat to religion and family. The vehemence of the opposition took many supporters of the plan by surprise. ""The fundamentalists are fixated on the question of women, but they have no program,"" said Mohammed Said Saadi, a former minister of state and one of the authors of the plan. ""Their preoccupation is morality and they put out a lot of lies about the plan, saying it would encourage homosexual marriage, make condoms available everywhere and encourage the debauchery of high school girls."" In Morocco, the king is called ""commander of the faithful,"" making him the highest religious authority in the country. King Mohammed VI has called for the advancement of women. But he has not yet said whether he will endorse the plan on women, which would open a direct confrontation with the Islamist opposition. After the demonstrations in March 2000, he appointed a committee to sound out public opinion. It is still holding hearings. Many Moroccan women fear that the moudawana reforms will be put aside to avoid more political turmoil. ""And if you put that part aside, what's left?"" asked Fatiha Layadi, a stylish young television reporter who drew stares for smoking cigarettes in public at an outdoor cafe in Rabat. ""If it's not the whole package, then how are you going to talk about women's empowerment?"" Islam's Evolution Her frustration says much about the evolution of Islam. Born in the tribal societies of the Arabian Peninsula in the seventh century, Islam vastly improved the lot of women of that time. It instructed men that they could have up to four wives, but only if they treated all of them equally and had the means to support them. A woman could inherit wealth instead of being inherited as part of her husband's or father's estate. As codified over the years, however, Islam eventually institutionalized the inferiority of women. The prophet Muhammad is said to have urged his followers to treat women with respect, but respect has come to mean control. And while some scholars have argued that Islam was meant to be flexible enough to adjust to a changing society, conservatives have held sway for centuries. Muslim women now find themselves constrained by tradition as much as religious law. Saudi women are forbidden to drive, ostensibly to protect their Muslim honor, just as most Muslim women need a male relative's permission to get a passport. ""Our prophet made his own bed, sewed his own shirts, helped his wife at home,"" said Sibel Eraslan, a veiled Istanbul lawyer who once headed a women's committee in the Turkish Islamist party, Refah. ""Today men don't want to follow Muhammad because it is easier not to. Even the hard-line Islamists ignore these details from our prophet's life."" She, at least, lives in a country that recently changed its laws to give women equal rights in family life. But Turkey did so to aid its application to join the European Union, leaving Mrs. Eraslan uneasy with what she called ""imposed changes."" For women seeking change, however, there are reasons for optimism.  Women's votes can count, as they did in bringing a moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, to power in Iran in 1997. And traditionalists no longer control all the religious debate. ""Educated women armed with computers have defeated extremists by denying them a monopoly to define cultural identity and interpret religious texts,"" said Fatema Mernissi, a Moroccan sociologist who has written extensively on women and democracy in Islam. ""No extremist can say that women are inferior to men without being made a laughingstock on Al Jazeera,"" she added, referring to the Qatar-based satellite news channel. ""Islam insisted on equality between everyone."" Islamic jurisprudence is based on the Koran, which Muslims consider the word of God, and on the hadith, the prophet's words and actions as recorded after his death. Koranic verse is the basis for giving a woman's testimony half the weight of a man's. Laws limiting women's political role rely on the hadith, particularly one that attributes to the prophet a particularly damning view of women's abilities to lead. ""Those who entrust their affairs to a woman,"" he is believed to have said, ""will never know prosperity."" Women, of course, have led Muslim countries in Asia. But they have advanced no higher than government minister in modern Arab countries, in part because Arab scholars have not strayed far from the most literal interpretation of that hadith. Yusuf al Qaradawi, an Egyptian scholar whose opinions reach millions through his weekly call-in show on Al Jazeera television, has written that ""a woman's first and greatest job"" is to produce and raise children. If she must work, he says in his published religious rulings, it should only be in jobs where she would not spend time alone with a man or neglect her family duties. In the context of traditional religious rulings, the sheik's views might be considered progressive. But some religious women have begun to push the boundaries of even modernist male scholars. Among them is Suaad Salih, a professor of religious jurisprudence at Al Azhar University in Cairo, who considers herself as capable of issuing religious rulings as any man with the title sheik, which she does in unofficial forums. Last month, on Islam Online (www.islam-online.net), Dr. Salih tackled the Koranic verse about the testimony of women. The verse actually demonstrates Islam's respect for women, she wrote. ""In cases of crimes like murder and adultery, Islam makes it clear that in principle, a woman should be kept safe from all these fields that may hurt her feelings,"" Dr. Salih wrote. ""However, if no other one is there to witness except a woman, her testimony may be accepted in such cases in order to preserve the course of justice.""

"262","A NATION CHALLENGED: REBEL REGION; Education Offers Women in Northern Afghanistan a Ray of Hope","MENA","Here, at least, they can ride in the back of trucks if a man deigns to let them. They can shop in the market, although they are allowed to speak to male shopkeepers only if it is absolutely necessary. And they can go to school, even if the list of professions they can choose from is small -- teacher, for instance, or midwife. Life for women here in rebel-held northern Afghanistan is not without its constraints. Some of the strict Muslim dictates rigidly enforced by the Taliban government that controls most of the country also apply here. But generally the Islam practiced here is far more permissive. In Taliban-ruled areas, girls older than 8 are barred from attending school, women cannot leave home unless accompanied by a male relative and then must be veiled from head to toe, and they are barred from most jobs, among other restrictions. Here, in territory under the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, 8 young women were allowed to join 300 young men studying at the university for the first time last year. Still, to a Western visitor, a striking feature of alliance territory is that women are seen only occasionally on the street, silently carrying a child or leaving a bazaar with food. The women are almost always covered by a light blue cotton burkah, a veil that extends from head to ankle. They rarely speak to men in public and almost never interact with foreigners. For a foreign man to speak with a woman here is possible, but it takes time and preparation. All interviews require the approval of local authorities as well as the consent of the woman herself. This afternoon, as the deputy director of the Gulbahar Orthopedic Center looked on, Mazari, a 30-year-old midwife, agreed to an interview in an examination room here. A thin veil covered the top of her head, but her face and hair were exposed. Mazari spoke haltingly at first but then grew more assured. She was the first woman in her family to attend a university, she said. Like hundreds of women of her generation, she traveled from a small town to Kabul to study there. ""I wanted to help our people,"" she said. ""I wanted to help women."" She has not been back to Kabul since the Taliban militia took control of the city in 1996. But many of her relatives, friends and classmates are still there, she said. ""They have no money,"" she said. ""They have no jobs."" Here in alliance territory, she said, girls are allowed to attend separate high schools. The few fortunate enough to go on to a university may study medicine, law, engineering and Islamic law. The only Afghan woman practicing medicine in the country works in alliance territory. Family pressure still plays a major role in marriage, but women in larger towns generally choose their own husbands. ""We have freedom,"" Mazari said proudly. ""We can shop. We can go to schools. We can teach girls."" She always wears a burkah in public, she said, but this is her choice. ""It's the tradition of our people,"" she said. ""It's not by order of the state."" She married her husband when she was 16, she said. Since then, she has given birth to seven children, and her husband has taken a second wife. Most Afghan men only have one. But she praises him for allowing her to work. ""I'm here because he's an educated person,"" she said. Later on, another woman, Zarina, entered the room, her face also uncovered. She is a 25-year-old cleaning woman at the hospital. Zarina, whose husband was killed fighting the Taliban, supports herself, her three children and her in-laws on her $35-a-month salary. The Taliban would not permit her to work like this, she said. ""If a woman doesn't have a husband, it's very difficult for her there,"" she said of the Taliban-ruled areas. ""Some of the women get help from charity organizations,"" she said. ""But others receive nothing."" She dreams of becoming a doctor some day, though that seems unlikely. Like 85 percent of Afghan women, she is illiterate. And by local custom, she is barred from remarrying. But any shortcomings in her life are less deeply felt, she said, than her hatred of the people who killed her husband and her hope for the future. ""I am very happy if the Americans come to Afghanistan,"" she said, displaying the optimism that is running rampant here, ""especially if they eliminate the Taliban."" Mazari said she thought of her friends, relatives and classmates still in Kabul. The Taliban government must fall, she said. ""The women can't work"" there, Mazari said. ""Women have to sit in their houses and stare at the walls.""",2001,"Afghanistan"

"266","A New Democracy, Enshrined in Faith","MENA","In his admirable if overdue speech last week, President Bush acknowledged 60 years of American error and announced a new policy of encouraging democracy rather than dictatorship in the Muslim world. What Mr. Bush neglected to mention was that many Muslims, if freed to make their own democratic choices, will choose Islam over secularism. A case in point is the newly released draft of the Afghan constitution, which enshrines Islamic values even as it guarantees basic liberties. The document raises a crucial question that goes well beyond Afghanistan to the Muslim world as a whole: Can a nation be founded on both Islam and democracy without compromising on human rights and equality? If the answer is no, then democratization in places like Iraq and Afghanistan will be a pyrrhic victory -- we will have gotten rid of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein without their former victims actually achieving real freedom. If, however, a synthesis of Islam and democracy can satisfy devout Muslims, while at the same time protecting individual liberties and the rights of women and non-Muslims, then Islamic democracy may be the best hope for improvement in the Muslim world. Make no mistake: the Afghan constitution is pervasively Islamic. Its first three articles declare Afghanistan an Islamic Republic, make Islam the official religion, and announce that ""no law can be contrary to the sacred religion of Islam and the values of this constitution."" The new Supreme Court, which is given the power to interpret the constitution, is to be composed of a mix of judges trained either in secular law or in Islamic jurisprudence. The new flag features a prayer niche and pulpit, and is emblazoned with two Islamic credos: ""There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his Prophet"" and ""Allah Akbar"" (""God is Great""). The government is charged with developing a unified school curriculum ""based on the provisions of the sacred religion of Islam, national culture, and in accordance with academic principles."" The provision requiring the state to ensure the physical and psychological well-being of the family calls, in the same breath, for ""elimination of traditions contrary to the principles of the sacred religion of Islam."" And yet, the draft constitution is also thoroughly democratic, promising government ""based on the people's will and democracy"" and guaranteeing citizens fundamental rights. One essential provision mandates that the state shall abide by the United Nations Charter, international treaties, all international conventions that Afghanistan has signed and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Because Afghanistan acceded in March to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women -- a treaty the United States Senate has never ratified -- the draft constitution guarantees women far-ranging rights against discrimination. It also ensures that women will make up at least 16.5 percent of the membership of the upper legislative house (only 14 of 100 United States senators are women.) In addition, the provision that makes Islam the nation's official religion also recognizes the right of non-Muslims ""to perform their religious ceremonies within the limits of the provisions of law."" This carefully chosen language might arguably leave room to restrict proselytizing -- as, for example, do similar laws in India and Israel -- but it nonetheless guarantees individual expression as an inviolable right. (It's worth noting that the right to change one's religion is enshrined in the human rights declaration.) Yes, if the draft is ratified by the grand assembly, or loya jirga, tensions in the constitutional structure will have to be resolved later by the Supreme Court. According to the draft, for instance, political parties must not be organized around a program contrary to Islam or the constitution. That would exclude an antidemocratic Taliban party; but would it also exclude a party of secularists who wanted to remove Islam from the constitution? What about laws requiring women to dress modestly: unconstitutional as a violation of women's rights, or constitutional as in accord with the teachings of Islam? The draft constitution gives guidance on all these questions, but the answers might well come down to the makeup of the Supreme Court: one dominated by illiberal religious scholars might interpret the text one way, while one with a majority of judges trained in the secular tradition might see it very differently. In its ambitions, attractions and dangers, the Afghan draft constitution can be seen as a metaphor for the wider prospects of Islamic democracy. Like the Afghan constitution, Islamic democracy has no chance if the West does not help create the economic prosperity and social stability for its success. After driving out the Taliban, the American-led coalition has done too little to bring Afghanistan under the control of a centralized government, nor has the United Nations presence in Kabul lessened the de facto control of the country by regional warlords. Unless America and the United Nations do more to buttress the sovereignty of an elected Afghan government, the constitution will inevitably become more of a symbol than an actual charter of governance. Similarly, unless America keeps steady pressure on Muslim countries to democratize -- rewarding meaningful elections and punishing human rights violations -- little progress will be made. The paradox, of course, is that if the people of Muslim countries do get a greater say in their own government, Islamic politics will likely prevail. Islamic parties speak the language of justice, the paramount political value to most Muslims. In some places -- Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia -- secular forces in the society counterbalance the rising Islamic politics. But in the Arab dictatorships, where secularist politics are associated with autocracy and graft, increased freedom will undoubtedly lead, at least in the short run, to new gains for political Islam. This leads some to say that we should not promote democracy in the Middle East lest we open the door to elections that might be, in the memorable words of a former assistant secretary of state, Edward Djerejian, ""one man, one vote, one time."" But calls to preserve the undemocratic status quo fail to acknowledge that the alternative to trying Islamic democracy may be much worse. It would be equally futile for the United States to unilaterally impose secularization in Afghanistan and Iraq. For a constitution to function, it must represent the will of its citizens. Nothing could delegitimize a constitution more quickly than America setting down secularist red lines in a well-meaning show of neo-imperialism. Rather, our goal must be to persuade a majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims that Islam and democracy are perfectly compatible. This will be especially true in Iraq, where the constitutional process must demonstrate to the Iraqi people and the rest of the world that the coalition intends to let Iraqis govern themselves. What's more, denying the possibility of democracy within Islam may bolster the case of Islamist radicals who, for very different reasons, claim that their religion and political freedom cannot mix. The draft Afghan constitution is just one possible picture of how Islam and democracy can live side-by-side in the same political vision. There are no guarantees in constitution writing or in nation building, and it is too soon to predict that the idea of Islamic democracy will take hold in practice -- in Afghanistan or elsewhere. All we can do is continue to press for democracy in the Muslim world: not because we naively expect a victory for secularism, but because freedom only makes sense as a value extended equally to all, to make of it what they will.",2003,"Afghanistan"
"267","Making A Nation More Equal","MENA","Women in Afghanistan have only a short time to influence the new draft constitution to be considered by the Constitutional Loya Jirga scheduled for next week. Although the new draft upholds the principle of human rights, there is no explicit guarantee of women's equality. This is not a matter of semantics. Rather, it raises serious questions about the document's commitment to protect women's rights. Despite visible advances in society, many Afghan women have seen little change over the past two years. Particularly outside of Kabul, women live under the tight restrictions of authoritarian and traditional practices, which keep women and girls at home and deny them access to education, job training and health care. Violence against women continues. Child marriages and forced marriages remain common, fueled by impoverishment and instability. Young girls are ""married"" to bring money into households or to settle disputes, a practice that condemns young girls to sexual abuse and sustained poverty. Outside of Kabul, women's security is threatened by local warlords who abuse women with impunity. The international community must rally behind the women seeking to enshrine their rights in the country's constitution. When every member of the Supreme Court, under the new constitution, must take an oath ""to support judicial justice and righteousness in accord with the provisions of the sacred religion of Islam,"" there must be clear language securing women's equality as a requisite counterbalance against extreme interpretation of Islamic law. The new constitution should state clearly that women have full and equal rights with men before the law. Although the constitution provides for an Afghan society based on ""social justice, protection of human dignity, protection of human rights, and realization of democracy,"" there is no explicit prohibition against discrimination based on gender. The constitution should also include clear language prohibiting any customs and traditional practices that discriminate against women. It should stipulate, for example, that marriage must take place freely and with the agreement of both parties. The Afghan Constitution must also include a clear definition of the word ""citizen."" (It should also substitute the term ""female-headed households"" for ""women without caretakers"" throughout the text.) In the past, there have been questions about women's rights to full citizenship, as only men have been issued ID cards. Although the constitution states that women are entitled to a specific number of seats in the National Assembly, it makes no provisions for their representation at the local level, where resistance to women's participation is most formidable. Women's right to work under fair and just conditions must also be stipulated in the constitution, along with prohibitions against forced labor. Women also deserve equal access to education and health care, and the constitution should ensure that school curriculums reflect the equality of men and women. Access to gender-specific health services should also be guaranteed. All of these changes have been suggested by legal experts in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Earlier this year Afghanistan ratified an international treaty that provides the Constitutional Loya Jirga a framework for incorporating them into the new draft. Two years ago, when Afghanistan was liberated from Taliban rule, the world realized that global security is inextricably linked to the protection and rights of women in society, and there was an international commitment to supporting Afghan women on the path to securing these rights. Today, we have a narrow window in which to make good on this commitment.

Still, in countries where men are also largely illiterate and needy, there are risks in promoting anything that seems to give an advantage to women.

It is a sad historical fact that violence against women, particularly women of color, has rarely been viewed as serious enough to warrant strong, decisive remedial steps. This has been true when violence is on an individual basis and when it reaches genocidal proportions, as is the case in Sudan. Fairfid M.

"275","Afghan Women at Polls","MENA","To the Editor: Re ''Fearful Choice for Afghan Women: To Vote or Not to Vote'' (news article, Oct. 5): In the first debate, George W. Bush proclaimed success in leading Afghanistan toward free elections, even saying 41 percent of the registered voters are women. But your article sheds light on how he distorts the facts to score political points. These Afghan women are afraid to leave their houses, let alone to cast their vote for fear of dishonoring their husbands or fathers. While these elections are an important step toward democracy, thus far, only the Afghan men are truly free to participate. Once again, just because George Bush says Afghanistan is safe for women doesn't make it so. It will take a lot more ''hard work'' until Afghan women are free.

"276","Israel Warriors Find Machismo Is Way of Past","MENA","For decades it was widely accepted that some of Israel's top military officers and government ministers considered sexual encounters with female employees a seigneurial right. A society built partly on the conscious effort to project an image of strength tended to overlook such harassment. In fact, a certain amount of male rakishness often added to a prominent man's allure. The alleged womanizing by national legends like Moshe Dayan, for example, was considered part of their mystique. But the ground is shifting rapidly under the feet of the current crop of leaders as a result of legal and societal changes. This week, the police recommended charging President Moshe Katsav with the rape of two former employees, the most serious criminal allegations ever made against an Israeli leader. And on Tuesday, Justice Minister Haim Ramon went on trial, accused of kissing a soldier against her will. ''When I was in the army it was assumed that the office of every senior officer was essentially a harem for him,'' said Michael Oren, an historian and a senior fellow at the Shalem Center, a Jerusalem research institute, who served in the military 30 years ago. ''Israel is emerging from adolescence into adulthood.'' In 1998 a sweeping sexual harassment law, inspired in part by American legislation, was passed by the Israeli Parliament, making such behavior illegal anywhere, whether in the street or the workplace. Soon afterward, a major turning point came: the trial of Yitzhak Mordechai, a former general who was Israel's defense minister and a prime ministerial hopeful. He was forced to resign after being convicted of sexual assault and harassment. His very public trial followed charges filed by several women who had worked for him in the government and during his long, highly decorated career in the army. For years trying Israeli leaders for such crimes was unheard-of. The founders of Zionism sought to create ''the new Jew'' -- aiming to transform Jews who lived in the Diaspora, perceived as bookish and weak, into men of muscle and power. The militarization of Israeli society that eventually followed in the wake of successive wars with Arab neighbors seemed to cement Israel's male-dominated character. And while that has not changed completely, the question of sexual harassment is getting real attention, especially in the army, which is the epicenter of such activity and the institution with the most influence on the society. In the last 10 years the army, into which nearly all Jewish 18-year-old Israelis are drafted, has begun intensively promoting awareness of sexual harassment and the consequences that can follow for those who cross the line. Several highly publicized cases in which senior officers were suspected of having sexually assaulted female soldiers made the army's efforts more urgent. Many female soldiers work in clerical positions. A senior officer often has several 18- and 19-year-old women serving as secretaries. The shift in the approach of the army toward harassment comes as it has opened itself up to placing women in roles traditionally thought to be the exclusive purview of men. Women now serve as pilots, artillery crew members, gunnery instructors and officers in charge of men. As part of the army's efforts to educate its members about sexual harassment, all conscripts receive a letter during basic training describing the issue and where to turn if they encounter such behavior. Workshops are held with soldiers and officers to increase awareness, and there is a 24-hour phone line for complaints and advice. Those suspected of harassment or assault are taken before a special committee that has the power to demote or discharge the accused, said Lt. Col. Liora Rubinstein, the deputy adviser to the chief of staff on women's issues. Many career officers have lost their jobs that way, she said. ''I can tell you, when I was drafted it was not spoken about,'' said Colonel Rubinstein, who has served in the army for 20 years. ''It was not part of our consciousness. Officers know now what is expected of them.'' Nonetheless, advocates for women's rights and others say the hesitancy of many accused men in army and civilian life to acknowledge responsibility is evidence that while the old era may be over legally, much remains to be done so that men understand the new rules. For example, Mr. Mordechai insisted that he had done nothing wrong. ''The more cases we have and the more women stand up and go and complain and are not afraid, there will be a change,'' said Rina Bar-Tal, chairwoman of the Israel Women's Network. But Ms. Bar-Tal said she was hesitant to declare a social transformation in what was still a patriarchal society. ''The law is there and the police abide by the law, and the infrastructure of our legal system is working,'' she said. ''I see that as a very positive note.'' The high-profile nature of recent cases like that of President Katsav, whose office is largely ceremonial, has made the issue a major topic of public discussion. ''The central ethical issue is the ease with which a respected and authoritative employer can manipulate the confusion, panic and dependence that characterize a young female employee in the public sector,'' Avirama Golan wrote in a column in the daily Haaretz titled ''All the President's Women.'' It has also led to broader examination of the country's history. Old school notions of masculinity were part of being a nation in an almost constant state of war, said Mr. Oren, the historian. ''It was all caught up in Israeli machismo, which had a certain role in order to establish a nation at arms,'' he said. Avigail Moor, a psychologist and expert on violence against women in Israel who is chairwoman of the women's studies department at Tel Chai College, said of the tales of sexual conquest that circulated around some powerful Israeli men, ''It was common knowledge that their titles gave them that prerogative. ''It was also made out to look very romantic. Young women serving in these high-status platoons were almost led to believe that it was something that spoke highly of them if they were chosen to be a sexual partner of a high commanding officer.'' The militaristic nature of Israeli society has eased, partly as it feels more secure and partly as Western influence has increased. An effort by the army to prevent its male soldiers from crying at the funerals of their fallen comrades, for example, has failed. In the past such open displays of grief were considered a sign of weakness. Yael Dayan, a former lawmaker and the daughter of Moshe Dayan, sponsored the sexual harassment legislation. She recalls being mocked during debate on the bill by some male colleagues and constituents. The comments, and the sense of backlash, have not ended, she said. She added: ''At traffic lights people stop me and say: 'Are you satisfied now? You got the president.' ''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com",2006,"Israel"
"277","Afghan Women's Progress","MENA","To the Editor: Re ''In Poverty and Strife, Women Test Limits'' (news article, Oct. 6): The fact that women are making significant progress in some parts of Afghanistan is good news that confirms our own experience in the country. The province of Bamian will benefit from women taking on new roles as breadwinners, peacekeepers and government leaders; indeed, the area's relative stability indicates that it already has. In many other areas the change is far less visible and comes in small but significant steps, with women learning skills and finding opportunities to support their families. But we cannot let these encouraging developments overshadow the life-threatening dearth of health care, education and basic human rights for the majority of Afghan women. Stabilizing Afghanistan must include teaching women how to read and write, develop sources of income and become more active in public life. Bamian shows that change is possible, even in the most challenging environments. Sweeta Noori Afghanistan Country Director Women for Women International Washington, Oct. 8, 2008",2008,"Afghanistan"

The Artificial Virginity Hymen kit, which is distributed by the Chinese company Gigimo and costs about $30, is intended to help newly married women fool their husbands into believing they are virgins, an essential marriage requirement for women in much of the Middle East, by leaking a blood-like substance when inserted and broken. Sheik Sayed Askar, a member of the parliamentary committee on religious affairs, demanded the government take responsibility for fighting the product, which he said would make it easier for women to give in to temptation.",2009,"Egypt"
"279","Saudi Women And the Right To Play Sports","MENA","After the 18-year-old Saudi equestrian Dalma Malhas won a bronze medal in show jumping at the first Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in August, she was singled out for praise by Jacques Rogge, chairman of the International Olympic Committee, in a news conference at the Games' conclusion. ''This is indeed the first time that a Saudi woman is participating in an international event,'' let alone winning a medal, Mr. Rogge said of Olympic events. Ms. Malhas's achievement, he said, had made the I.O.C. ''absolutely happy.'' The reaction in Ms. Malhas's conservative Muslim homeland -- where sports for women are seen in some quarters as immodest, even immoral -- has been far more complicated. Physical exercise of any kind is forbidden in Saudi Arabia's state-run schools for girls. Though gyms for women exist in major Saudi cities, they are usually unmarked, so that customers need not fear attracting attention. Saudi Arabia does not permit women to represent it in international athletic competitions, and it is one of only three countries that has yet to send women to the Olympic Games. (The others are Qatar and Brunei.) Although Saudi Arabia sent an official delegation of male athletes to Singapore for the Youth Olympics, Ms. Malhas -- the daughter of an accomplished female show jumper, Arwa Mutabagani -- had to enter on her own, at her own expense. Now her bronze medal has placed her at the center of a growing controversy in the kingdom about what kinds of athletic activity, if any, are acceptable for Saudi girls and women. The laws and customs that govern the lives of Saudi women are among the most restrictive anywhere. Public separation of the sexes is stringent. Saudi women may not drive or vote and must wear floor-length cloaks known as abayas and head scarves whenever they leave home. They may not appear in court. But in recent years, women's issues have become a major battleground between liberals and conservatives. Saudi traditions regarding the rights and treatment of women have rarely, if ever, been so much in dispute. The issue of Saudi women in sports is a manifestation of this larger debate. On July 31, the Saudi dissident Ali al-Ahmed, who directs the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington, started a campaign called ''No Women. No Play,'' urging the I.O.C. to suspend Saudi Arabia from Olympic competition until it allowed female participation. In a telephone interview, Mr. Ahmed likened the position of Saudi women today to that of blacks in apartheid-era South Africa and asked why the I.O.C. had not suspended Saudi Arabia from the Games as it banned South Africa from 1964 through the end of apartheid in the early 1990s. ''Even more than political pressure, the expulsion of South Africa from the Olympics was one of the most effective tools for ending apartheid,'' Mr. Ahmed said, without referring to the more prominent role accorded sports over all in South African society, or whether an Olympic ban would have the same effect in Saudi Arabia. ''The freedom to practice sports and to exercise is such a very basic issue,'' Mr. Ahmed said. ''It has to do with physical health. I think that once Saudi women are free to practice sports, that will open up other areas of discussion about their rights.'' The Olympic charter states that ''the practice of sport is a human right'' and that ''any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic movement.'' A spokeswoman for the I.O.C., Emmanuelle Moreau, indicated in an e-mail that the I.O.C. had no intention of formally censuring countries that did not allow women to participate in the Olympics. She said the organization did not plan to give Saudi Arabia a deadline, as it did with apartheid-era South Africa. ''The I.O.C. strives to ensure the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement are universal and nondiscriminatory,'' Ms. Moreau said. She added about their current policy: ''National Olympic committees are encouraged to uphold that spirit in their delegations. The I.O.C. does not give ultimatums nor deadlines, but rather believes that a lot can be achieved through dialogue.'' Outside of Olympic teams, there have been signs of change for Saudi sportswomen. In major cities, a handful of private basketball and soccer teams for women have sprung up. In 2008, Ms. Mutabagani was made a board member of Saudi Arabia's Equestrian Federation, the first such post for a woman in Saudi sports. Saudi newspaper columnists have argued that relaxing the prohibitions against physical exercise might help to stem exploding levels of obesity and osteoporosis among Saudi women. Lina al-Maeena, who in 2003 founded Jeddah United, a women's basketball team that has since grown into a full-fledged sports training and management company, agrees. ''You have very high rates of diabetes, obesity and osteoporosis for women, a very high rate of depression,'' she said. ''You have this conservative segment here that's using religion to oppose women's sports. But that's a very invalid argument.'' She hopes that pressure from the I.O.C. may help to break down the barriers to women's athletic participation. ''At the end of the day, the Olympic charter does state that there shall be no discrimination based on gender, religion or ethnicity,'' she said. ''And Saudi Arabia is obviously not following the Olympic charter.'' Liberal Saudis note that even Aisha, the young wife of the prophet Muhammad, is reported to have enjoyed footraces against her husband and that conservative Muslim societies like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have more open attitudes about women and sports. Last year, the daily newspaper Al-Riyadh reported that a survey of 2,250 Saudis found that a mere 4 percent were opposed to gyms for girls and women. But majority opinion counts for little in an absolute monarchy, in which the king rules in concert with a fundamentalist religious establishment. Some of the most prominent clerics continue to oppose sports for women under all circumstances, arguing that sports will lead them to engage in behavior like wearing immodest clothing or leaving their homes unnecessarily. Other clerics argue that sports are absolutely off limits only for virgins, who could become unmarriageable if they were to damage their hymens through athletic activity. ''Women should be housewives,'' the grand mufti told the Saudi channel Al Eqtisadiah. ''There is no need for them to engage in sports.'' Female Saudi athletes say they find it unproductive to debate views openly. ''I don't want to provoke people,'' Ms. Mutabagani said. ''The conservative side always says: 'No, you should be at home. You shouldn't be traveling, you shouldn't be competing in public.' '' Ms. Mutabagani wears a veil when she is representing Saudi Arabia overseas as an official of the federation and said she always tried to emphasize, in interviews, the less controversial aspects of women's sports, like the importance of exercise for health. ''I try to respect our culture,'' she said. ''You don't want to create a negative opinion of women in sport.'' Ms. Maeena said that looking at women's movements globally helped her stay optimistic. ''It's not just in Saudi that sports for women are a political issue,'' she said. ''Up until 1972 with the Title IX, women in the U.S. didn't really get equal rights in sports. And that's, what, three decades ago? And it's a 250-year old country. ''We're only a 78-year-old country,'' she continued. ''When you gauge yourself from the historical perspective, you see that the process Saudi Arabia is going through is a very normal process that all societies have gone through in relation to different fields of endeavor for women.''",2010,"Saudi Arabia"
"280","Divorce Soars in Iran as Women Work System and Defy Tradition","MENA","TEHRAN -- The wedding nearly 1,400 years ago of Imam Ali, Shiite Islam's most revered figure, and Fatemeh al-Zahra, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, is commemorated in Iran's packed political calendar as a day to celebrate family values. But in a sign of the Iranian authorities' increasing concern about Iran's shifting social landscape, Marriage Day, as it is usually known in Iran, this year was renamed No Divorce Day. Iran's justice minister decreed that no divorce permits would be issued. Whether the switch was effective or not, the officials' concerns are understandable. Divorce is skyrocketing in Iran. Over a decade, the number each year has roughly tripled to a little more than 150,000 in 2010 from around 50,000 in 2000, according to official figures. Nationwide, there is one divorce for every seven marriages; in Tehran, the ratio is 1 divorce for every 3.76 marriages, the government has reported. While the change in divorce rates is remarkable, even more surprising is the major force behind it: the increasing willingness of Iranian women to manipulate the Iranian legal system to escape unwanted marriages. The numbers are still modest compared with the United States, which typically records about a million divorces a year in a population about four times as large. But for Iran, with a conservative Islamic culture that strongly discourages divorce, the trend is striking, and shows few signs of slowing. In the last Iranian calendar year, ending in March, divorces were up 16 percent from the year before, compared with a 1 percent increase in marriages. ''In May, a registry office I work with recorded 70 divorces and only 3 marriages,'' said a lawyer who requested anonymity for fear of retribution by the Iranian authorities. ''The next month, a friend at another office said he recorded 60 divorces and only one marriage.'' He noted that both offices were in central Tehran and not in the city's affluent north, which is considered more liberal and Westernized. Not only is divorce on the rise, but marriages are also failing early, with 30 percent of divorces in any given year occurring in the first year of marriage and 50 percent in the first five years. Some people, doubtful of the government statistics, suspect that the numbers are even higher. Conservative commentators call the problem a social ill on par with drug addiction and prostitution. Senior officials and members of Parliament have increasingly referred to the issue as a ''crisis'' and a ''national threat.'' Explanations for the rising divorce rate vary. More liberal commentators emphasize factors like rapid urbanization, high living costs and a jobless rate that official figures put at close to one in four among 16- to 25-year-olds. Conservatives often point to what they say is growing godlessness among the young and the corrupting effects of the Western media. ''High dowries, high living costs, lack of jobs and financial support make young people fear marriage,'' said a member of Parliament, Gholamreza Asadollahi, who also blamed young people who had lost their belief ''in the unseen power of God to solve life's problems.'' But most experts agree that nothing has contributed as much as a deep-rooted awakening in Iranian women that is altering traditional attitudes toward marriage, relationships, careers and, generally speaking, women's place in what is still an overwhelmingly patriarchal society. Twenty percent of Iranian women are employed or actively looking for jobs, according to government figures, compared with 7 percent in the first years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Female undergraduate students outnumber men in Iran's universities almost two to one. ''This economic freedom has had an effect on the behavior of women in the home,'' said Saeid Madani, a member of the Iranian Sociological Association. ''In the past, if a housewife left her home, she would go hungry; now there is a degree of possibility of finding a job and earning an income.'' But something more is at work than simple economics, many experts say. ''Women have found the courage to break with tradition and say no to the past,'' said Azardokht Mofidi, a psychiatrist and the author of several books on psychoanalysis. ''They are no longer prepared to put up with hardships in marriage, and their expectations have risen to include equality in relationships.'' Nazanin, a woman nearing 50 who has been divorced twice, has experienced the change in attitudes. Married at age 18, during the politically charged years of the Islamic Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war, Nazanin divorced two years later in the face of a society that still held firm to the Persian adage that a woman enters her husband's home wearing a white wedding dress and leaves it in her white funeral clothes. ''For years, I hid the fact,'' said Nazanin, relaxing without a hijab in the modest, sparsely decorated apartment where she lives with her adult son. ''For a while, my family told the neighbors stories and lies, saying he had gone to work abroad. At work, because I was still young, I kept wearing my ring and didn't tell anybody.'' After she broke up with her second husband 14 years ago, her religious parents were once again mortified, but friends were more accepting. In the years since, Nazanin says she has seen a reversal in society's attitudes. ''Now, it has become so normal that society has become neutral,'' she said. ''Our generation has completely lost its sensitivity to divorce. It's so common that you can see it in your own family. You just accept it.'' Even so, she would give only her first name and refused to be photographed, for fear of being punished by the authorities. Iran's rising divorce rate is all the more noteworthy given the laws on divorce. While husbands are empowered to end their marriages in a matter of weeks without stating any reason, women must establish sufficient grounds for divorce in a process that can take several years, even with professional legal advice. Facing such an uneven playing field, marital lawyers say, Iranian women have increasingly turned to leveraging their legal right to a mehrieh -- a single payment agreed on before marriage that constitutes a kind of Islamic marriage insurance. Husbands are obliged to pay this sum to wives when they divorce. Under what are known as ''divorces of mutual consent,'' a woman may forgo part or all of her mehrieh to provide a financial incentive to her husband to let her leave. In recent years, there have been exponential increases in the value of mehriehs, which now often reach the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars. Some conservatives have raised the idea of capping mehriehs to reduce the divorce rate. Clerics and government officials promote the idea of having a purely symbolic mehrieh, like a handful of gold coins or a Koran. Whether such measures can stem the tide of divorce remains to be seen, particularly in a society where it seems to be losing its stigma. ''At first I was afraid of how society would treat me after divorce,'' said a seamstress named Sara, 33. ''But after all the support that I got from my friends and my father, my uncle and aunts and the people who I turned to for advice, I thought, 'No, the period in which people were prejudiced against divorce is over.' No one ever judged me.''",2010,"Iran"
"281","Beware of Female Drivers","MENA","Many ridiculous reasons have been given over the years for Saudi Arabia's de facto ban on women drivers (de facto because there is no formal law, but women cannot obtain licenses). If women drive, it's been said, they will lose their modesty and overcrowd the streets. In a sad meet moment, it is also said that women who drive will find it easier to rebel against their husbands. Over the last six months, there have been signs that King Abdullah might be ready to reconsider the ban - a possibility that reactionary Saudis aren't taking lightly. Hence a new report, prepared by a conservative academic named Kamal Subhi for the legislative assembly, which contains some fairly novel rationales against women drivers. Issuing licenses to females, it claims, will lead to an increase in prostitution, pornography, homosexuality and divorce. It will also encourage premarital sex. Obviously Mr. Subhi has a fantastic imagination, or mistook David Cronenberg's  for a documentary. Are Saudi men so fragile that the mere sight of a female driver will lead them into a state of sinfulness? Is the line between upstanding citizen of Saudi Arabia and divorced-homosexual-pornographer so thin? This sort of pessimism or radical mistrust is not, of course, unique to Saudi Arabia. It's a regular feature of anti-equality arguments generally. In the 1990s, alumni members of Yale's Skull and Bones club obtained a court order blocking the secret society from admitting women. One person opposed to gender integration of the society claimed it would lead to an increase in date rape. The assumption, which I find truly disturbing, was that inside every male undergraduate lurked a potential rapist. Or maybe just inside every Skull and Bones member. I have the same reaction to those who rail against gay-marriage on the grounds that same-sex unions will somehow harm heterosexual ones. It's strange to suggest that straight couples can't withstand the shock of two men or two women committing to spend their lives together. They can survive all kinds of shocks. There was a story a while back from Japan about a man who wed his pillow. Many, many millions of other Japanese marriages managed to get through that cataclysm. There wasn't even a jump in pillow sales, that I heard about, anyway.",2011,"Saudi Arabia"
"282","For Some Egyptian Women, a Fear of Losing Equal Rights","MENA","I wear a veil and jeans. I have a fiancé and a job. In a country where the majority of women need permission from a male guardian to go the movies, I have had a rare experience of complete independence. I live on my own, pay my own rent, choose my own clothes and travel to other countries without asking permission from my father or my fiancé. I pursue whatever dreams I have without worrying about traditions or social restrictions. This may seem normal or ordinary to many women around the world. But it is much more freedom than the overwhelming majority of Egyptian women can claim. With the first free parliamentary elections, I was reminded that a significant number of men and women in my homeland believe the amount of freedom I have might be too much or even wrong and impious. I have attended rallies for the Islamist parties dominating the elections and I have talked to many of their voters. And they all tell me that my fears as a working independent woman who likes her life exactly as it is are secondary to more important pressing issues for the future of this country. I'm secondary to the reconstruction of Egypt and my fears are trivial compared to crucial matters such as security, the economy and the power struggle between the ruling military council and the Tahrir Squares around the country. But I'm still, maybe selfishly, concerned with my own life. I'm concerned with what would happen if, as in Saudi Arabia, a law were passed to ban women from traveling without a male guardian, or, as in Egypt a few years ago, without a male guardian's permission, and how this would affect my career as a human rights activist and a journalist. I'm concerned with what would happen if an Islamic ascendance were to stir an ideological shift that led ordinary people in the street to believe that my jeans were impious and that I was unworthy of respect because I wore them. I'm concerned with what would happen if I decided to divorce my husband and whether I would even be legally permitted to initiate a divorce. I'm concerned with what would happen if I decided not to have children and a law were passed to ban birth control. I'm concerned with the kind of society I will raise my children in. I'm concerned with whether or not I could ever run for parliament, or governor or president. I have a concern for a daughter I may have. I want her to feel worthy of respect regardless of what she chooses for herself. When she goes to school, I don't want her to have to take the classes I had to take on how to cook and clean just because she is a girl. I don't want her to grow up as I did in a struggle between what she is made to believe she ""should"" be as an Egyptian woman and an aspiration to one day be free to be whoever she decides to be. The radical conservative Salafis say they know society isn't ready for some parts of their interpretation of Sharia, such as Islamic banking, cutting the hands of thieves and stoning women for adultery. The society needs preparation first, so don't panic just yet. The more mainstream Muslim Brotherhood acts more like a disapproving father who rewards your brother for doing the right thing rather than punishing you for doing the opposite. Their tool is a cultural and ideological movement toward a pious society that encourages their vision of virtue, abiding by their relatively more moderate interpretation of Sharia. I heard a Salafi sheik tell a crowd that those afraid of Sharia must be alcoholics, fornicators and thieves because that is who should be scared of its punishments. I'm not a thief, nor am I a fornicator or an alcohol drinker, but I'm still concerned. I'm concerned about living in a society ruled by a government that gives itself the right to restrict my freedom in the name of my own religion. And I'm simply not secondary.",2011,"Egypt"
"283","Can Islamism and Feminism Mix?","MENA","Monica Marks is a doctoral student in Middle Eastern Studies at Oxford University.  Oxford, England TINY Tunisia, where a fruit seller's suicide sparked the Arab Spring, held its first free elections on Sunday. Over 90 percent of registered voters turned out, far exceeding expectations. Lines of beaming blue-fingered voters poured out of polling places, proudly posting photos of their freshly inked hands on Facebook. Yet despite Tunisia's election day success story, many observers fear that democracy could unleash an Islamist tidal wave. The Islamist party Ennahda, banned as a terrorist group under the dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, won approximately 40 percent of votes -- a resounding plurality. A small but increasingly vocal minority of secular Tunisians are predicting that an Islamist-dominated national assembly will reverse key pieces of civil rights legislation, including those recognizing the right to abortion and prohibiting polygamy. Tunisia's secular feminists, many of whom are urban admirers of French-style secularism, see Ennahda women as unwitting agents of their own domination. Although Ennahda openly supports Tunisia's 1956 Code of Personal Status -- arguably the most progressive piece of women's rights legislation in the Arab world -- its critics accuse the party as a whole of purveying a ''double discourse,'' adopting a soft, tolerant line when speaking to francophone secularists but preaching a rabidly conservative message when addressing its rural base. Rather than developing strong platforms of their own, secular opposition parties like Ettajdid have focused their campaign efforts almost exclusively on fear mongering, raising the specter of an Iranian-style Islamist takeover and the imposition of Shariah, the legal code of Islam. Daniel Pipes and other Western commentators have joined the fray, urging Washington to stand against the ''blight'' of Ennahda and labeling Islamism ''the civilized world's greatest enemy.'' But it is far too early to sound such alarms. As a result of their active participation in party politics, Ennahda women actually stand to gain more from Sunday's election than any other group. In May, Tunisia passed an extremely progressive parity law, resembling France's, which required all political parties to make women at least half of their candidates. As a long-repressed party, Ennahda enjoyed more credibility than other groups. It also had a greater number of female candidates to run than any other party, and strongly supported the parity law as a result. Many Tunisian women developed a political consciousness in reaction to Mr. Ben Ali's severe oppression of Ennahda in the 1990s. While their husbands, brothers and sons were in jail -- often for reasons as simple as attending dawn prayers -- these women discovered that they had a personal stake in politics and the strength to stand alone as heads of families. When the party was legalized in March, it found a widespread base of public sympathy and grass-roots support. As the big winner in Sunday's elections, Ennahda will send the largest single bloc of female lawmakers to the 217-member constituent assembly. The question now is how Ennahda women will govern. Are they unwitting dupes of Islamic patriarchy, or are they merely feminist activists who happen to wear head scarves? After interviewing 46 female activists and candidates from Ennahda, I found that many turned to politics after experiencing job discrimination, arrests, or years in prison merely because they chose to wear the head scarf or because their families were suspected of Ennahda sympathies. For some of them, this election is as much about freedom of religious expression as anything else. ''I have a master's degree in physics but I wasn't allowed to teach for years because of this,'' said a 43-year-old woman named Nesrine, tugging the corner of her floral-print hijab, a veil banned under Mr. Ben Ali but legalized since his departure. According to Mounia Brahim and Farida Labidi, 2 of the 13 members of Ennahda's Executive Council, the party welcomes strong, critical women in its ranks. ''Look at us,'' Ms. Brahim said. ''We're doctors, teachers, wives, mothers -- sometimes our husbands agree with our politics, sometimes they don't. But we're here and we're active.'' These women are not likely to oppose women's rights legislation. Ennahda women are, first and foremost, Tunisians. They are well educated, and their brand of Islamism, like Tunisian society as a whole, is relaxed and comparatively progressive. Since the 1950s, Tunisian women have enjoyed greater legal protections than their counterparts in other Arab states. Tunisians are currently seeking to reconcile this legacy of largely French-inspired civil rights policies with the aspirations of a devout public. Ennahda's challenge lies in striking the right balance. To do so, the party has explicitly declared that it will emulate Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party, known as the A.K.P., which has cracked down on corruption, involved women as equal political partners, and delivered stunning economic growth rates. Replicating this model of moderation and pious prosperity will be hard work in Tunisia, a country with staggering levels of unemployment and 25 percent illiteracy. Turkish-style democracy may look less progressive in Tunis -- where angry protests recently broke out at a screening of the film ''Persepolis'' -- than in Istanbul, where bars and dance clubs dot the city's streets. And there is a chance, of course, that democratic gains for women could be reversed. As history has shown in America, France, Algeria and Iran, revolutionary movements don't always lead to greater gender equality or more inclusive politics. Women often fight fearlessly in such liberation struggles only to be sidelined when new national governments form. Tunisian women, however, are well poised to avoid this fate. Tunisia has done an excellent job of including women in its transitional institutions thus far. This is especially true when viewed in comparison with Egypt, where the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces recently banned women from heading any party lists. Ennahda has thus far used its newfound political heft to stimulate rather than stifle women's participation in Tunisian politics. Its activists are presenting a potentially more accessible model of ''Islamist feminism'' to many rural and socially conservative Tunisian women than that of secularist parties. Vocal, active, and often veiled, they are comfortable with the language of piety and politics. Despite the fear mongering of secular skeptics and Western pundits, their actions and aspirations are far more reminiscent of Turkey's A.K.P. than Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.",2011,"Tunisia"
"284","Hinting at an End to a Curb on Polygamy, Interim Libyan Leader Stirs Anger","MENA","TRIPOLI, Libya -- It was just a passing reference to marriage in a leader's soberly delivered speech, but all week it has unsettled women here as well as allies abroad. In announcing the success of the Libyan revolution and calling for a new, more pious nation, the head of the interim government, Mustafa Abdel-Jalil, also seemed to clear the way for unrestricted polygamy in a Muslim country where it has been limited and rare for decades. It looked like a sizable step backward for women at a moment when much here -- institutions, laws, social relations -- is still in play after the end of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's 42 years of authoritarian rule. In his speech, Mr. Abdel-Jalil declared that a Qaddafi-era law that placed restrictions on multiple marriages, which is a tenet of Islamic law, or Shariah, would be done away with. The law, which stated that a first wife had to give permission before others were added, for instance, had kept polygamy rare here. ''This law is contrary to Shariah and must be stopped,'' Mr. Abdel-Jalil told the crowd, vowing that the new government would adhere more faithfully to Shariah. The next day he reiterated the point to reporters at a news conference: ''Shariah allows polygamy,'' he said. Mr. Abdel-Jalil is known for his piety. He also remarked cryptically, ''We will not abolish any law.'' Still, some women here saw the collective remarks of the chairman of the Transitional National Council as a menacing sign that the new Libya would mean new repression. Human-rights lawyers also viewed the comments as a clearly aimed swipe at the Qaddafi law on marriage, as did a scholar of Islamic law at the University of Tripoli. Libya experts abroad saw the leader's foray as a political effort aimed at placating newly influential Islamists. ''He and the other leaders are not quite certain which way this is going to turn,'' said Dirk J. Vandewalle, an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College. ''They are hedging their bets. The worrisome thing is he mentioned these things, which take him outside the mainstream.'' Abroad, the reaction was one of dismay among allies whose military firepower ensured Colonel Qaddafi's fall. The French foreign minister, Alain Juppe, said: ''This is a problem for us, especially in regard to respect for the dignity of women.'' He later was forced to defend the government's championing of Libya's rebels against critics in the National Assembly. And among young women at the university in Tripoli, the sentiment was overwhelmingly negative, even for those more tightly wrapped in head scarves than the others, who agreed with Mr. Abdel-Jalil that Shariah should be the basis for the country's as-yet unwritten new constitution. Women here played an important role in the uprising, yet signs of their traditional status -- they stand separately from men at rallies, and an overwhelming majority wear head scarves -- persist after the revolution. ''To follow Islamic rules is a good thing. To have many wives is not a good thing,'' said a 24-year-old biology student, Awatif Alhjagi. ''I'm worried. People that did not have that right before may now get four wives,'' she said. ''Because he talked about it, they probably will do it now.'' There was disquiet that Mr. Abdel-Jalil had zeroed in on the marriage issue in a relatively brief speech. Unprompted, the young women circulating in a university courtyard angrily brought up his comments. ''All the girls are mad that he said that,'' said Bushra ben Omran, a 20-year-old English student. ''I don't want to marry somebody who is already married.'' ''He should not have said this in his speech,'' Ms. Omran added. ''He didn't focus on all the injured people'' from the revolution, she said. ''I didn't expect this.'' Rehab Zehany, 20, who said Mr. Abdel-Jalil was merely following the dictates of the Koran, added, when asked if she would accept her husband taking a second wife: ''Of course not! I would kill him!'' Unlike in its African Muslim neighbors to the south, where multiple-wife family compounds are frequently seen, polygamy has hardly been part of the essential fabric of daily life here. Under Colonel Qaddafi, there was a notion that polygamous marriages were the exception, said Azza Kamel Maghur, a lawyer here. Apart from the wife's consent -- delivered in front of a judge -- a man had to give reasons for taking another wife. Like other women here, Ms. Maghur, whose father was briefly foreign minister under Colonel Qaddafi, was sharply critical of the country's temporary leader for proposing fundamental changes during a period of transition. ''Women gained rights in the 1970s,'' she said. ''We don't want to lose them.'' Mr. Abdel-Jalil had gone beyond his limited brief, she said: ''You can't change the law related to interest or family law. No, no, no!'' In Benghazi on Friday, several hundred men staged a demonstration in support of Mr. Abdel-Jalil and demanded that his prescriptions be carried out. At the very least, the leader opened up the subject for debate, female activists here said -- even if they are wary of the direction in which Mr. Abdel-Jalil appears to be pointing the country. ''He's saying, a marriage of four women,'' said Hana el-Gallal, a leading human rights lawyer. ''But a marriage of four, there isn't an open license for that. To just make it an open license, to talk about these topics in such a manner, it's very disappointing,'' she said. She added, ''It would have been a better priority to talk about elections.'' Mansour O. El-Kikhia, chairman of the department of political science and geography at the University of Texas at San Antonio, said that Mr. Abdel-Jalil's speech demonstrated the interim leadership's ''inexperience and amateurism,'' adding that he had ''done a disservice to females.'' That was the view among women -- though not some men -- at the university in Tripoli. ''I'm meeting people who say, 'Now I can marry three, four wives.' This is totally wrong,'' said Najah al-Tabeb, a 37-year-old psychology instructor. ''Men can never treat women equally,'' she said, smiling and shaking her finger when asked if she would marry a man who was already married.",2011,"Libya"
"285","Driving May Damage Your Ovaries","MENA","[Video: Watch on YouTube.] CAIRO - Despite official warnings and threats, dozens of women got behind the wheel in several Saudi cities late last month to protest the kingdom's ban on women driving. This little bit of automotive defiance means a lot: It is a renewed challenge, by Saudi women and the men who support them, to the religious authorities' extreme and coercive brand of Islam. It wasn't the first protest of its kind. There was one in 1990, and another in 1991, during which 47 women drove cars around the capital. They were arrested, fired from their jobs and attacked by name in Friday sermons. But ""circumstances are entirely different now,"" Nora Al Sowayan, one of the pioneering protesters, told me by phone from Riyadh. This time the official response was mild: The worst penalty was an $80 fine. This, Sowayan argued, is a sign that Saudis have become more accepting of the idea of women driving than they were two decades ago. In one video, a young Saudi comedian poked fun at the ban by singing ""No Woman, No Drive"" to the Bob Marley tune. Sowayan said the Arab Spring  played a role in Saudi Arabia, as has King Abdullah's expansion of women's rights: He recently appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, a consultative body, for example. Religious conservatives, for their part, were incensed by the driving protest. They rightly saw it as a great threat to the rigid sexual segregation that is a cornerstone of their authority. Saudi cities are like Texas suburbs: They were built around the automobile. There are few pedestrians, and what public transportation exists is often for men only. Preventing women from driving is an extremely effective way of curbing their freedom of movement and controlling them. And so the Saudi authorities don't issue women licenses, even though there is no basis in Islam and no Saudi law forbidding them from driving. Lacking a formal basis for the ban - which exists in no other Muslim state - Saudi religious conservatives have concocted curious arguments to justify it. Women drivers may spend too much on beauty products. They will distract male drivers. They risk being abducted. Driving could damage their pelvises and ovaries. Yet some of the women who drove around last month recounted joyful encounters. ""Neighboring cars rolled down their windows to wave and give us thumbs up or just to smile,"" wrote one of the participants, the blogger Eman Al Nafjan. Those neighboring cars were driven by men, of course. Saudi Arabia's perverse system of religious-political authoritarianism requires men's complicity in oppressing the women closest to them, the wives and sisters who are their legal wards. That means women can't get out of the backseat without men's support. But it also means that when the men refuse to act as guardians, they are taking a step toward the political emancipation not just of women but of all Saudis.",2013,"Saudi Arabia"
"286","Egypt's Trouble With Women","MENA","CAIRO -- In December 1933, an air race from Cairo to Alexandria was held. The first plane to cross the finish line was piloted by a 26-year-old woman named Lotfia El Nadi, Egypt's first female aviator. To have a flying career was not easy for Lotfia. Her father had rejected the idea, but she did not despair. She persuaded the director of the Institute of Aviation to let her work, free of charge, as his secretary -- in exchange for flying lessons. As she later explained, ''I learned to fly because I love to be free.'' Lotfia became a hero and a national treasure in the eyes of Egyptians. Women saw her as an inspiration in their struggle for equal rights, and many young women followed her example by applying for flying lessons. Egyptian women made advances in equality throughout the period of the monarchy, which ended in 1953. After the republic of Egypt was established, under Gamal Abdel Nasser, women continued to advance, achieving positions in universities, Parliament and the senior judiciary. The historical advancement of Egyptian women contrasts sharply with the results of a new Thomson Reuters Foundation survey that found Egypt ranked overall worst among 22 Arab countries for discrimination in law, sexual harassment and the paucity of female political representation. Why do Lotfia's granddaughters suffer from problems today that she managed to overcome 80 years ago? After the 1973 war in the Middle East, the price of oil shot up. This gave Gulf states unprecedented power, while the economic shock forced millions of Egyptians to emigrate to work there. Many of these Egyptians came home having absorbed radical Wahhabi values. Egypt's tradition of moderate Islam recognized women's rights and encouraged women to study and work. By contrast, for Wahhabis, a woman's job is to please her husband and provide offspring. Wahhabi preachers promote female genital mutilation, to control women's sexuality. A woman must cover her body completely and may not study, work or travel. She cannot even leave the house without her husband's permission. Wahhabism has influenced all Islamic societies and movements, including Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood. As it spread in Egypt, more women started to wear the hijab, or head scarf. But this did not create a virtuous society; it led to the reverse. Until the end of the 1970s, many Egyptian women still went without head scarves, wearing modern Western-style dress, yet incidents of sexual harassment were rare. Now, with the spread of the hijab, harassment has taken on epidemic proportions. A 2008 study from the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights revealed that 83 percent of women interviewed had been subjected to sexual harassment at least once, and that 50 percent experienced it on a daily basis. Why is it that men did not harass Egyptian women when they wore short skirts but that sexual harassment has increased against women in head scarves? When ultraconservative doctrine dehumanizes women, reducing them to objects, it legitimizes acts of sexual aggression against them. The Mubarak regime had various differences with the followers of political Islam, but the two camps converged in their contempt toward women. In spite of some formal reforms instigated by Suzanne Mubarak, who wanted to appear as an enlightened first lady, the Mubarak era witnessed a deterioration in women's rights. Even so, it was not until 2005 that sexual harassment became an organized form of retribution against Egyptian women who took part in anti-Mubarak demonstrations. The security apparatus paid thugs, known as ''beltagiya,'' to gang up on a woman attending a demonstration, tear off her clothes and molest her. This sexualized form of punishment continued through the period of the military regime and into the Brotherhood's rule. On Dec. 17, 2011, during a demonstration against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces near Tahrir Square in Cairo, soldiers pulled a female protester's clothes off and dragged her along the ground, stomping on her with their boots. A video of the attack went viral, eliciting the sympathy of millions. Solidarity committees were formed, and the victim of the attack became an icon for Egyptian women. But the Islamists, at that time allied with the council, mocked the victim, blaming her for not staying in the home -- as was seemly for a respectable woman. During the revolution, millions of Egyptian women went out and bravely faced snipers' bullets, but those who gained power played down their bravery and attempted to sideline them. After the 2012 election that brought the Muslim Brotherhood to power, there were only 10 female members of Parliament out of a total of 508. President Mohamed Morsi's later attempt to rewrite the Egyptian Constitution would also have removed the only female judge on the Supreme Constitutional Court. In short, the Islamists strove to eradicate the gains Egyptian women had made. They tried to overturn the law punishing doctors who carried out female genital mutilation, and refused to consider the marriage of minors as a form of human trafficking by claiming that Islam permitted a girl as young as 10 years old to be married. Women's rights are a bellwether of the current conflict in Egypt. The revolutionaries are fighting for equality, whereas the reactionary forces of both the Brotherhood and the Mubarak regime are trying to strip women of their political and social rights and make them subject to men's authority. The conflict will eventually be resolved in favor of women because the revolution represents a future that no one can prevent. In 2002, Lotfia El Nadi died at age 95. Shortly before her death, she said: ''I don't recognize Egypt as it is now, but the Egypt I knew will return. I am certain of that.'' Alaa Al Aswany is the author of ''The Yacoubian Building.''

"287","Afghan Effort To Get Justice For Women Seems to Stall","MENA","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Despite years of intensive effort by Afghan and international rights advocates, progress in obtaining justice for abused women in Afghanistan appeared to have stalled, according to a report released Sunday by the United Nations. The report, on the implementation of the 2009 Elimination of Violence Against Women law, found that although the number of official reports this year by the police and prosecutors on violence against women rose by 28 percent from the previous year, actual prosecutions did not remotely keep pace, rising by just 2 percent. At the same time, there are intensifying fears that the continuing withdrawal of international money and staff members ahead of the 2014 Western troop pullout deadline will leave women particularly vulnerable, after a decade of international attention made little headway in curbing some deeply entrenched and abusive Afghan traditions. ''With the drawdown in international assistance and support, there is a real risk that any advances in women's rights will erode, and there's already disturbing signs of that,'' said Georgette Gagnon, the head of the United Nation's human rights division here, who led the team that put together the report. As an example, Ms. Gagnon said, the lack of an ability to bring abusers to justice was likely to increase ''the risk of more child marriages, more forced marriages and violence against women with impunity.'' The backsliding has already begun, in fact. Over the past year, there have been repeated efforts in Parliament to reduce women's rights. One new restriction in particular is likely to hurt: Parliament prohibited the use of relatives' testimony in criminal cases, greatly limiting the ability to prosecute domestic violence cases, as they often hinge on family members as witnesses. There was also an effort to codify the Elimination of Violence Against Women law, which was approved as a decree by President Hamid Karzai in 2009 but has not been passed by Parliament. The law criminalizes domestic violence and other harmful practices, including beatings, child marriages, forced marriages, the practice of giving away a woman or girl to settle a dispute and forced self-immolation. But the effort to pass the law through Parliament last summer nearly unraveled it altogether, as conservatives seized the opportunity to declare many of its provisions ''un-Islamic,'' including the prohibition on child marriages, forced marriages and unrestricted rights to education and women's shelters. The Parliament speaker stopped the debate and sent it back to committee. Parliament was successful, however, in reducing the quota of seats for female members of Parliament to 20 percent, down from 25 percent, and eliminated any quota at the district level. The quotas for women used to pertain to all levels of government. Hasina Safi, the executive director of the Afghan Women's Network, said her organization had been studying child and forced marriages and concluded that they were directly linked to violence against women. Ms. Safi and other women's rights advocates, as well as Ms. Gagnon, fear an increase in such marriages as the economy worsens and families turn more frequently to selling their daughters. Analysts took one bit of solace from the study: The increase in the number of complaints appeared to signal at least some rising awareness among women of their rights and a greater willingness to come forward and seek justice. However, tempering that was the reality that many more complaints were received by the Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission than were ever brought to the police. In 15 of the 16 provinces surveyed, more than 1,000 complaints were received by provincial offices of the Women's Ministry, but only 650 complaints were registered with the police or prosecutors. In the narrower context of the law and the prosecution of abuse, the United Nations report found that in the past year, most cases were settled by mediation, which human rights advocates said meant women were often sent back into the family circumstances in which they were abused. Based on examination of cases in 16 provinces (the United Nations said Afghanistan's other 18 provinces did not provide enough information), few prosecutors were even using the Elimination of Violence law as a basis for indictments. The law was reported to have been used in only 17 percent of cases, 109 out of 650 registered episodes in those provinces this year. Worse, despite the rise in reports under the Elimination of Violence law, the overall number of criminal indictments filed by prosecutors under all the applicable criminal laws actually decreased this year. Some prosecutors prefer to use other criminal laws than the Elimination of Violence law in cases of abuse.",2013,"Afghanistan"
"288","In Saudi Arabia, Even Writing About Female Drivers Can Mean Trouble","MENA","A columnist in Saudi Arabia who published a commentary on women's rights has been detained by the authorities as they cracked down on a campaign by the kingdom's women this month to defy a ban on driving. The columnist, Tariq al-Mubarak, wrote an article that was published in English on Oct. 7, and in Arabic the previous day, on the website of the international daily newspaper Asharq al-Awsat. In part, it says:  Tens of thousands of female students are learning what independence means, due to the several years they spend studying in the West. Young people, both men and women, have become responsible for building their personalities and giving a special meaning to their lives. This new self-regard is crucial to forming their hopes for the future, and it cannot be ignored simply because it is a cultural trait, especially in an open world such as ours today. Those monitoring the language of women on social networks right now will notice a tone indicative of suppressed anger that results from the difference between their own sense of self and their position in the current social system. Their anger largely wells up from the need to recognize the individuality of women in the world we live in today, whether we like it or not. This individuality is being violated in several ways. Women are viewed as a burden on men in many dealings with the government. They are unable to move around the cities in which they live unaccompanied by a man due to a lack of public transportation or restrictions on women driving cars. They sign up to a broken system of marriage - broken because of the values on which it was established and its authoritarian nature. And that is not to mention other issues, including divorce and child custody. We need to reconsider some concepts of Islamic jurisprudence, keeping in mind the human dignity that has been endorsed by all religions.

"289","Saudi Women Rise Up, Quietly, And Slide Into the Driver's Seat","MENA","RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Hackers defaced their Web site. Delegations of clerics appealed to the king to block their movement. And men claiming to be security agents called their cellphones to leave a clear message: O, women of the kingdom, do not get behind the wheel! But they did anyway. On Saturday, a few dozen women insisted on violating one of the most stubborn social codes in staunchly conservative Saudi society, getting into their cars and driving, activists said. Many posted videos of themselves doing so to spread the word. ''We are looking for a normal way of life,'' Madiha al-Ajroush, 60, a psychologist, said in an interview in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, ''for me to get into my car and do something as small as get myself a cappuccino or something as grand as taking my child to the emergency room.'' The public call for women nationwide to drive on Saturday was the latest push in a decades-old effort by a small group of activists to exercise what they see as a fundamental human right. Saudi Arabia, a hereditary monarchy, is the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. The fact that the activists have been at it for so long without creating a mass movement or any change in government policy underlines the power of tradition in Saudi society and the tremendous political clout of social conservatives who fear that Westernization or anything that looks as if it will detract from the kingdom's Islamic character, even though malls, high-end shops and fast-food outlets cover the Saudi landscape. Despite the strong opposition, the women believe that time is on their side. They point to the huge numbers of Saudis who study and travel abroad and return with new perspectives on their culture. They also suggest that the kingdom's youthful population and the tremendous rise of social media will over time make the country more open to change. But their movement's goal is profoundly modest compared with the Arab Spring calls for democracy hat have toppled some Middle Eastern governments and shaken others. They have gone out of their way to avoid anything that looks like a protest, remain deeply loyal to the 89-year-old King Abdullah, and studiously avoid confrontations with the authorities. ''We don't want to break any laws,'' said Ms. Ajroush, who has been campaigning for the right to drive since 1990. ''This is not a revolution, and it will not be turned into a revolution.'' When it comes to women's rights, Saudi Arabia remains one of the most restrictive countries in the world. So-called guardianship laws mean that a woman cannot marry, work or travel abroad without the consent of a male relative. The government does not issue licenses to women, and women have been detained or fired from their jobs for driving in the past. In an effort to at least respect traffic laws, the driving campaign restricted itself to women with licenses obtained abroad. The call for women to drive on Saturday led to an explosion of comments and arguments in Saudi social media. The Interior Ministry last week warned against all acts that ''disturb the social peace and open the door to discord.'' A new statement Friday threatened punishment for anyone involved in ''assemblies and banned demonstrations calling for women to drive cars.'' Some opponents pointed out that Oct. 26 was the birthday of Hillary Rodham Clinton, implying a foreign hand in the planning. Last week, hackers broke into the campaign's Web site, posting insults aimed at a prominent activist and a video in which a man identified as a Zionist calls for women to drive -- implying that Saudi's enemies see this as a way to weaken the kingdom. Religious figures have also weighed in. One prominent sheik, Nasser al-Omar, led a delegation of more than 100 sheiks to the royal court in Jeddah to appeal to the king against ''the conspiracy of women driving,'' as he said in a video posted online. Another cleric, Sheik Mohammed al-Nujaimi, described the campaign as a ''great danger,'' saying it would lead to ruined marriages, a low birthrate, the spread of adultery, more car accidents and ''the spending of excessive amounts on beauty products.'' ''The learned have banned women from driving cars because of the political, religious, social and economic problems it entails,'' Sheik Nujaimi warned in a statement. Even some who support the campaign say much needs to be done beforehand: women must be taught how to drive, issued licenses and given legal protections from harassment. On Saturday in Riyadh, there appeared to be more Western journalists looking for female drivers to interview than women behind the wheel of a car. By evening, activists said they had received videos and messages from dozens of women saying they had driven to support the cause. One artist released a video mocking the restriction, borrowing from a Bob Marley song. Ms. Ajroush said she aborted her attempt to drive when she and a friend found themselves followed by two men. They sought refuge in a mall, but the men followed them. She bought a yellow toy car and presented it to the men as a gift, but they stormed off angrily, she said. Mai Swayan, 32, a mother of two who works at a Riyadh bank, was more successful. Early Saturday, she drove to a supermarket, bought milk and drove home. The trip took about 15 minutes, and no one stopped her. She said she was not concerned about the low turnout but appreciated the support for those women who did drive. Not long after her return home, she was still elated by the experience. ''I'm so proud of myself right now,'' she said.",2013,"Saudi Arabia"

"292","Turkish President Says Women Shouldn't Be Considered Equals","MENA","ISTANBUL -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday used an international conference on justice and rights for women to declare that women should not be regarded as equal to men and that pregnancy presented an obstacle to equal opportunity in the workplace. Mr. Erdogan also condemned feminists for rejecting motherhood. ''You cannot put women and men on an equal footing,'' Mr. Erdogan said in an address to the conference here, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency. ''It is against her nature -- because her nature is different, her bodily constitution is different.'' The president, a Muslim who as prime minister until recently led the Islamic-inspired Justice and Development Party that controls the government, said that pregnancy and motherhood were sacred in Islam. Some forms of work, he cautioned, are unsuitable for women. ''You cannot make women work in every job that a man works at, as in Communist regimes,'' he said. ''Give her a shovel and make her work -- this cannot be. It would primarily be against her delicate nature.'' Women's rights activists stormed social media networks with furious responses to the address. ''The Constitution, international agreements have all been crushed,'' Fatma Aytac, a member of KA-DER, a women's group, posted on Twitter. Ozlem Dalkiran, a human rights activist and advocate for gender equality in Turkey, said in an interview: ''There is an apparent effort in changes made to the labor law to lock women indoors, and we should be aware of Erdogan's constant threat against us. ''What he misses, though, is that the women's rights movement in Turkey is a very strong one, and his provocative statements are making us even stronger.'' Turkey ranked 125th out of 142 countries in an assessment of gender equality in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2014. In his speech on Monday, Mr. Erdogan asserted that justice rather than equality was what women needed. His remarks reportedly received loud applause from members of the Women and Democracy Association, a conservative nongovernmental organization that sponsored the conference and whose board includes Sumeyye Erdogan, one of his daughters. As prime minister, a post he held until being elected president in August , Mr. Erdogan repeatedly called for Turkish women to bear at least three children. He wanted to limit cesarean sections, arguing that women who give birth that way usually cannot have more than one child. He also sought to abolish most abortions. All of those positions provoked an uproar among the country's staunchly secular liberals. The president's remarks on Monday came a week after he claimed that the Americas were discovered by Muslims at least 300 years before Columbus.",2014,"Turkey"

"295","WOMEN IN IRAN CHAFE AT ROLE SINCE THE REVOLUTION","MENA","- In the heady days when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini rallied Iranians from far leftists to extreme rightists against the Shah, tens of thousands of women donned the chador, the traditional black, all-enveloping veil, as a symbol of political protest. Women took to the streets, cursing the Shah.  Rifles in hand, some fought on the barricades beside men.  Others hid anti-Shah pamphlets and ammunition under their veils. Two years after women helped bring Ayatollah Khomeini to power, some of them feel they have won nothing but the status of secondclass citizens in his Islamic republic. ""Women participated in the revolution as effectively as men,"" said Shahin Navai of the left-wing Iranian National Union of Women, a small group whose newspaper stopped publishing six months ago for lack of an official printing license.  ""We helped end a dictatorship because we wanted freedom.  What do we have now?"" While there was no segregation of the sexes in the fight against the Shah, there is now.  Iran's Islamic authorities have even extended it to air raid shelters built after war erupted with Iraq. Taken to see a shelter in Ahwaz, capital of the embattled Khuzistan Province, foreign correspondents asked why the bunker was divided by a heavy curtain. ""One half for women, one half for men,"" said an official. Since Shite Moslem clergymen came to power here for the first time in a modern state, critics say, they have effectively reduced the minimum marriage age for girls from 16 to 13, abolished mixed schools, thrown out of the Shah's antipolygamy law and changed the divorce laws to favor men. The critics cite a new law on marriage and divorce as proof of the ruling clergy's bias against women.  For though the law says a man needs his first wife's consent before he can take a second, exemptions render the provision all but meaningless. Wife's Obedience a Key Factor One clergyman, Hojatolishlam Mahdavi Kermani, said that the first wife's consent is not needed if she fails to ""obey"" her husband sexually or if she is barren. Not all women take a harsh view of postrevolutionary Iran,but even female defenders of the present system concede that it does not favor women. Azam Taleghani, one of two women in the 217-member Iranian Parliament, blamed Iranian society's traditional backwardness for the fact that women have achieved less than men from the revolution. Mrs. Taleghani, who runs the Government-sponsored Society of Islamic Revolutionary Women said in an interview: ""There are sentences in the Koran that explain the basis of political activity by women.  Islam never wanted to imprison women.  On the contrary, it says women should be able to act and feel responsibility in order to raise children. ""You know, this is a sensitive point in Islam but since the Government has always been in the hands of men, they never wanted to inform women about that."" But she insists: ""We are trying to get women's rights."" Mrs. Taleghani wore a black chador, a garment often cited in the West as a symbol of female oppression, but she said: ""It is only Western propaganda that claims the chador is something that causes the degradation of women.  It is simply a type of dress.  Those who believe in tradition keep the chador, just as Indian women wear the sari."" Critics say tradition is hardly the issue.  The chador or the hejab, a headscarf tied under the chin and usually worn with a calf-length dress over trousers, is now regulation wear for women working in Government offices. ""For women in Government jobs, there are two alternatives,"" said Shahin Navai. ""Wear the hejab or get fired.""",1981,"Iran"
"296","SAUDI MEN STILL HOLD FIRM REIN, BUT WOMEN HAVE EASIER TIME","MENA","Fawzan wears the traditional head-to-toe veil, but in her furniture store she appears in fashionable European clothing. ''If a woman in Saudi Arabia wants to work, she can,'' Mrs. Fawzan said. ''The veil won't stop you. In running a business I am contributing to the economic growth of Saudi Arabia, and I am doing so by observing all our Islamic traditions and practices.'' As the Saudis race to invest their oil riches in ambitious economic-development programs, the roles played by Mrs. Fawzan and many other urban women indicate that the traditionally conservative Islamic social structure is gradually yielding to change. Nonetheless, many restrictions remain on women in this country of perhaps 10 million people. Despite the insistence of Saudi religious leaders that women enjoy equality with men in the Islamic world, the situation is clearly weighted in favor of Saudi men. Women are not allowed to work with men, and no one is predicting the early lifting of this prohibition. Women and men are not permitted to swim together. Socializing is frowned upon; even in private, it is said, few unmarried women will venture to mix with unattached Saudi men without the presence of a family-approved chaperone. Most marriages are still arranged, sometimes with cousins. Women who travel are required to be accompanied by close male relatives, who have the traditional right to see them unveiled. Virtually all women feel compelled by custom to wear the veil in public. A woman needs the approval of the senior male member of her family to start or own a business. Mrs. Fawzan had to obtain the written authorization of her husband; a commercial license was then issued by the Government. Among educated women in such cities as Riyadh, Jidda, Taif, Dhahran and Dammam there is some grumbling about the restrictions. Some women maintain, in particular, that keeping the bans on individual travel and on driving is irrational and that it confuses tradition and religion. The changes concerning the status of women and the opportunities available to them largely apply to urban women, whose proportion of the female population is indeterminate because of the absence of official census figures. In the nomadic desert communities, officials say, it will be a long time before change takes place, at least partly because of pervasive illiteracy. Education is not mandatory, and while urban families may feel compelled to send their children to school, that compulsion hardly exists in rural areas, which also suffer from a lack of schools. As for the veil, in interviews across the country remarkably few women objected to it vigorously.  ''The veil is protection for our bodies - it is not a prison for our minds,'' said Cecile I. Rouchdy, headmistress of the Dar al-Hannan girls' school in Jidda. Fatamma al-Awsiyeh, a 20-year-old resident of Jidda who has a job in a bank run by women, agreed that the veil offered ''Islamic-style protection,'' but she added that ''the way it is done here is an intrusion.'' Asked whether she felt otherwise restricted, she said that life for women was generally unrestricted within the household and that she, like other affluent Saudi women, frequently traveled abroad with her family. ''The freedoms I would like are to be able to drive and to travel on my own,'' she added. The changes taking place are manifest in increasing educational and employment opportunities for women - opportunities that, in effect, are being provided within a wholly separate and selfcontained sector where there is little contact with men. Like Mrs. Fawzan, scores of women are becoming entrepreneurs, scores more are entering educational careers and increasing numbers are physicians, administrators in governmental agencies and members of bank staffs. A third of the 16,000 students at Riyadh University are women, according to the president, Dr. Mansur al-Turki. Perhaps half the Saudi physicians are women, and more than 500,000 girls attend primary and secondary schools, according to Mrs. Rouchdy, the Jidda headmistress, who said that the number of girls attending primary and secondary schools - another indeterminate statistic - was increasing by 25 percent annually. ''It is true that change has been tremendous, and its impact on women is far-reaching,'' said Dr. Fatma Mandily, vice dean of the University Studies Center for Girls at Riyadh University. ''We are fortunate that this change has taken place within the framework of our Islamic traditions and the old code of ethics. Their modernization, so to speak, has made Saudi women more sociable, more openminded and more open-hearted. Yet we are still adhering to our Islamic way of life.'' Although there has been resistance to such change from some segments of the powerful religious hierarchy, the developments of the last few years have, by and large, been acquiesced in by the religious leaders, who shape much of policy. Dr. Mahmoud M. Safar, Deputy Minister for Higher Education and one of the Government's most articulate spokesmen, said: ''We have already passed the stage of such questions as to whether we should let our women work or not. We have no illusions about the contributions Saudi women can make to the development of our country. But our great challenge is to allow her to work and at the same time to maintain the characteristics of the Moslem woman.'' What this means is that beyond the overall Government policy of encouraging female literacy and education, there are few specifics concerning the promotion of employment or career opportunities for women. A Government commission is reportedly examining areas of work to be officially approved for women. Women who run boutiques or beauty parlors may run the risk of having their businesses closed down, even if temporarily, by the so-called religious police or members of the Society for the Preservation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. The recently disclosed third five-year plan calls for the participation of women in the development of the country, although few specifics are offered. Officials such as the Minister of Planning, Hisham Nazir, one of the most prominent technicians, are known to espouse the position that since more than 50 percent of the potential labor force of 2.5 million are female, the increased employment of women could help Saudi Arabia become less reliant on foreign labor. Women have traditionally been employed in such areas as teaching and nursing. ''But as more of us travel and see the kinds of opportunities available to women elsewhere, there is a feeling that educated women could contribute in more fields in Saudi Arabia,'' said Mrs. Fawzan, the furniture store owner. Fatimah Khalil Deffaa, who is in charge of the women's banking center at the Saudi American Bank, formerly Citibank, here, reports that when her agency opened for business six months ago she was flooded with applications. Wasisa Hakim, 23, who recently returned from Britain after earning her high school diploma, has joined the Saudi American Bank as a teller and works in the women's section. Driven to work the family chauffeur, she wears a veil outdoors. ''I wanted to work because I am determined to do something with my time and my life,'' Miss Hakim said. ''Women's banking represents a step forward for the role of women in our kingdom.'' She expressed concern about what Westernization: ''We think about this Westernization process a lot, and among some of us there is concern about Western influence. When we go abroad for education and come back, it doesn't mean we are Westernized. People like me take education to develop ourselves and for the ultimate benefit of our country. That does not mean we forget our culture.'' Miss Hakim is among those women who believe it essential for their country to ease out the large numbers of foreign workers, of whom there are at least 2.5 million, to preserve a conservative, traditional culture with its own special character. Miss Hakim, stating that she did not feel restricted by society, said: ''People ask, 'Why don't single women get to meet single men without an escort?' Well, it is not in our tradition to meet men that way. We have freedom up to a point. I don't think our women should go as far as Western women do. We don't usually discuss things like politics, for instance, but these are things that as women don't concern us.'' Another Saudi woman at the bank, 20-year-old Basama al-Owssiy, who was queried about marriage, replied: ''Ask God. The right person hasn't come along. I would like to build a career, and I think that is possible along with marriage responsibilities. If the right person comes along, I can reach agreement with him. I can't see him having any objections to my working. I don't want to be simply a housewife and stay at home.'' A number of women say that the key to change is more education.  ''Education is the basis of the change that is taking place in Saudi society for women,'' Mrs. Rouchdy said. ''But for the most part Saudi women do not want to change their social norms. They don't want to run away from Islamic values and from religion. They are saying, We don't want the superficial aspects of Westernization but only the scientific part of it.'' She said that one factor encouraging parents to send daughters to school was concern that many young men who traveled abroad for education returned with foreign wives. Noting that Saudi women's education started barely 20 years ago, she added, ''We have come a very long way.''",1981,"Saudi Arabia"
"297","MEETING DISCUSSES 'WOMEN'S WORLDS'","MENA","More than 400 female scholars and feminists representing 30 countries - most from the United States and Israel and some from India, Japan, Argentina and South Africa, among others - are attending what they describe as the first interdisciplinary congress on the theme of ''women's worlds'' here. The five scheduled days of 68 symposiums at Haifa University on research in topics of special concern to women, ranging from marriage and child care to politics and the army, were sponsored by 12 organizations, most of them American. The aim: ''to bring women from all parts of the world together to talk about research on women and how to put that research into a comparative framework,'' said Donna E. Shalala, president of Hunter College. It is viewed as the first serious attempt at establishing an international network of female scholars and an opportunity for women in the social sciences and humanities to get to know colleagues in other countries. ''Although the female world has also accumulated a great deal of informal expe rience, the formal knowledge that has been transmitted to women has been the male canon,'' Jessie Bernard, author of ''The Female World, '' told an attentive, applauding crowd. She pinpointed a ''strategic dilemma'' facing women's movements in the 1980's: whether to co ntinue the struggle for equality in separate organizations or to ''mainstream'' with integrated men's a nd women's groups. Despite the ''scientific'' focus of the congress, Dr. Bernard's message struck a popular chord with women of diverse occupations who were present. ''I felt included even though I'm not an intellectual,'' said Lindy Myeza, who is from Soweto, a black township adjacent to Johannesburg. Miss Myeza, a nursery school director and the single parent of three adopted teen-agers, said she was attracted to the congress as a unique opportunity to reach out from the isolation of black women in her country. Sindhu Phadke, a regional director for Unicef from Calcutta, India, said she was overwhelmed by the flurry of activity and interraction in the space of a few hours. Commenting on the American feminist ideas that dominated the congress, Dr. Phadke said they seemed to provide ''a broad enough framework to be applicable in third world countries like India.'' But she observed, ''There's a lot of intellectual development that doesn't affect the masses of women.'' Israeli women, who made up more than half the participants, were hopeful that the congress could raise consciousness on womens' issues. A warm atmosphere of camaraderie prevailed in the classrooms, where research findings were exchanged on ''the socialization of women as artists'' and ''women and power,'' and in the hallways, where women of diverse nationalities conversed freely.",1982,"Israel"
"298","A NEW ISRAELI LAW PROHIBITS SEX BIAS IN JOBS","MENA","Israel's first law on equal employment opportunity, in effect since New Year's Day, prohibits discrimination in hiring and advertising for jobs on the basis of sex or marital or parental status. Nitza Shapira-Libai, adviser to the Prime Minister on the status of women, termed the law an important first step, but she pointed out that it did nothing about what she called the primary obstacles to equal opportunity - dismissals, promotion and retirement privileges.  Furthermore, she said, some minority groups, such as Israeli Arabs, are not protected by the legislation. She also pointed out that the law did not force an employer to hire a woman who is qualified; it simply provided for penalties for failing to do so. Such an employer can be fined the equivalent of $300 or be sentenced to serve up to six months in prison. For placing a discriminatory ad in a newspaper - many job ads here specify sex - a fine of about $130 is provided. Role of Women in Military In addition, jobs described as ''security-related'' are excluded from coverage under the law. The result is to bypass the disputed issue of the role of female conscripts, who are often assigned to clerical duties in the military. The measure, introduced more than three years ago by Sarah Doron, a Member of Parliament in Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Likud bloc, was approved last spring. Zohar Karti, who is in charge of enforcing the law for the Ministry of Labor, said she had already sent warning letters to most of the major daily newspapers that have continued to advertise secretarial and typing jobs for women and technical and administrative positions for men. But, she said, it would be difficult to prosecute in ca ses of subtler forms of discrimination, where it would be necessary to prove that a woman's qualifications were equa l to a man's. One of the major obstacles to enactment of the law, Dr. Libai said, was existing ''protective legislation'' for women. A series of laws and regulations adopted since the 1950's enable mothers but not fathers to take a year's leave of absence without pay or to resign and receive compensation after childbirth. Mothers may also leave work an hour earlier, and women are barred from night-shift work except in certain professions. Dr. Libai said that because of the strong opposition to repealing such laws, it was hard to pass a measure that would support the promotion of women and insure the equalization of salaries. As it is, she said, the bill took more than three years to clear Parliament because of lobbying efforts by elements within the major political parties.",1982,"Israel"
"299","ABOUT THE MUTILATED HALF","MENA","THE HIDDEN FACE OF EVE Women in the Arab World.  By Nawal El Saadawi. Translated and Edited by Dr. Sherif Hetata.  Foreword by Irene L. Gendzier.  212 pp. Boston: Beacon Press. Paper, $8.25. TEN years ago in Cairo I met an Egyptian woman of whom I recall the following: She was 35 years old, handsomely dressed, spoke three foreign languages fluently, worked as a bilingual researcher, had lived five years in Toronto with her engineer husband; also, she had been married off by her father at 16, had four children by the age of 22 and was kept housebound by her husband, who was otherwise kind and worthy of her affection and of whom she remarked sadly, ''I know that my husband will not take four wives, but the fact that under the law he is permitted to do so colors his emotions, and mine.'' One last thing about this woman. She had been circumcised at the age of 6; that is, her clitoris had been surgically removed from her body. Nawal El Saadawi - a 50-year-old Egyptian doctor, novelist and feminist - has written many books about this woman. As a consequence of these writings, Dr. Saadawi has fallen into severe disfavor in her own country. Formerly head of the women's program of the United Nations in Africa, and of the women's program for the United Nations Economic Commission for Western Asia, she rose to become director of public health in Egypt, but was dismissed from her post in 1972 when her book ''Women and Sex'' was published. This past September she was arrested (along with 1,500 other Egyptian intellectuals) and served three months in jail under the ''Law for the Protection of Values from Shame.'' If you imagine Margaret Sanger in Brooklyn in 1916 - her birth control clinic smashed by the police, her books and pamphlets confiscated, herself dragged off and held for trial on charges of immorality - you have something of the position of Nawal El Saadawi today in Egypt. ''The Hidden Face of Eve'' is the first of Dr.  Saadawi's books to be translated into English. For an American feminist, it is a curious work. Written by a Marxist who has read Freud, in a country and for a people that require an educated introduction to the idea of equality for women, the book seems disoriented by the inorganic nature of its understanding. On the one hand, it reads like a 19th-century tract; on the other hand, its appeal to reason is drawn from references so sophisticated as to make the condition described sound even more surreal than it usually does. IN Egypt today under the law a man may take four wives; a girl may be married off by her father without her consent; no woman may petition for divorce; a man may obtain a divorce by the simple act of repudiation; a woman has no right of custody of her children; a husband need not pay alimony or child support if his wife has withheld herself sexually; a husband has the right to forbid a wife to work or to travel or even to move freely in her own environment; a husband has the right to have his wife forcibly returned to his home if she has left it without his consent. While a fraction of urban university-educated women escape their ''destiny,'' the mass of women in Egypt live out their lives in the manner ordained by such social conditions. ''The Hidden Face of Eve'' is divided into discussions of life for women in contemporary Egypt, women in world history, women in Arab history and literature. The longest and by far the most powerful section is called ''The Mutilated Half.'' Its subject is the equation still prevalent in the Arab world between a man's honor and a woman's virginity. Consistent with this all-absorbing concern that a ''girl'' not be a ''woman'' on her wedding night is the barbaric practice of female circumcision, designed to insure that a woman will not be tempted to give away what is clearly not hers to give. Dr. Saadawi's discussion of modern-day circumcision in Egypt is eloquent. She begins with herself. The daughter of a provincial Controller of Education, she was seized in her bed in the middle of the night at the age of 6, dragged into the bathroom, where her legs were pried apart and her clitoris slashed off. Eyes shut tight, she cried out in pain and terror for her mother; when she opened her eyes she saw her mother standing above her, smiling among the murderers. NAWAL grew up, became a doctor and spent years listening to hundreds of her patients repeat this experience, almost word for word, as they sought to explain their fear and hatred of sex. Female circumcision became an obsession that led her to realize that ''amputation of the clitoris ... goes hand in hand with brainwashing of girls, with a calculated merciless campaign to paralyze their capacity to think and to judge and to understand.'' As a Marxist Nawal El Saadawi believes ardently that the subjection of women is fundamentally a function of capitalist societies. She resents Westerners who ignore this crucial analysis with what she feels is an easy dismissal of all life under Islamic law. But while it is certainly true that Islam alone is not responsible for the condition of women in the Arab world - they share too much with women the world over - it is also appallingly true that no culture as religion-dominated as Arabic culture can ever accomplish social or political equality for women. The struggle is difficult enough in secular cultures where lip service is paid to the idea of universal individuation. IN the 19th century, American feminists quarreled with Christian society over liberal and illiberal interpretations of Biblical injunctions regarding women (exactly as Dr. Saadawi here argues for the liberalism inherent in the Koran). Finally, Elizabeth Cady Stanton said, ''This is nonsense. All religious structures posit man as the living godhead with woman as his obedient servant. It will never be otherwise. We must turn away from religion altogether.'' Western feminists do have reason to think Islamic law will never grant women full recognition. It may be possible to abolish the practice of circumcision, but it will not be so easy to abolish the idea of woman as an instrument of man's honor or dishonor. That idea springs from a religious notion in which equality for women and service to God cannot co-exist. ''The Hidden Face of Eve'' reminds us of where we have all come from.",1982,"Egypt"
"300","COURT RULING ON WIVES DEVIDES EGYPT","MENA","The abolition of a women's rights law last month by Egypt's Supreme Court has touched off a furious debate here and put the Government of President Hosni Mubarak in a politically awkward position. On May 6 the court struck down on procedural grounds the ''personal status'' amendments of 1979. While Egyptian law never banned polygamy, the amendments required a man to notify his wife officially if he took a second wife. If she objected, she could divorce him within a year, receive alimony promptly and retain custody of young children in their apartment, or in another that the husband was required to provide. Feminists and liberals have protested the court's ruling that struck down these provisions. Although she rarely criticizes Egypt publicly, Jihan Sadat, wife of the late President Anwar el-Sadat, said in an interview here that she was ''shocked and deeply dismayed'' by the abolition of the law, which she had championed and her husband had issued by decree. ''Egyptian women must fight this,'' said Mrs. Sadat, who taught classes this spring at American University in Washington and the University of South Carolina. She recently returned to Cairo. Fundamentalists Like Decision Islamic fundamentalists and other conservatives have disagreed with Mrs. Sadat and have applauded the court's decision. Though the country's Islamic religious establishment supported the 1979 law, fundamentalists argued that it was inconsistent with Sharia, the 1,300-year-old Moslem code. The Constitution says Sharia is the ''principle source'' of Egyptian law. The court action has forced President Mubarak to choose between competing demands of liberals that the law be reintroduced in the Parliament and of the Islamic fundamentalists, who oppose a new statute. President Mubarak has tried to steer a middle course. He says he will reintroduce a bill that is consistent with Sharia, or at least with Egypt's interpretation of it. But some Egyptians warn that he may wind up pleasing neither camp. ''The effort to codify Sharia as it applies to sensitive issues of sex, marriage and divorce risks opening the Government to charges of heresy by those who disagree with the Government's interpretation of religious law,'' warned Said el-Ashmawi, a judge, a Moslem and an opponent of Egyptian fundamentalism. 'Who Gets the Apartment' The complex and highly sensitive debate over the law highlights ways in which Egypt's pressing economic problems have affected interpersonal relationships. ''This has been portrayed as a struggle over women's rights and over whether or not Egypt will adhere to the principles of Islamic law,'' said Ahmed Baha el-Din, an influential Egyptian writer and a supporter of the 1979 law. ''But what is really at issue is who gets the apartment after a divorce.'' The housing shortage in Egypt is acute, particularly in Cairo. Marriages are often delayed, some up to 10 years, because a couple cannot find an apartment it can afford. As a result, many men in this highly traditional, male-dominated society fiercely resented the requirement that, in the event of a divorce, a man either find his first wife and young children a new flat or move out of his own. Many intellectuals, especially leftists, have also been slow to criticize the court's ruling because they favor elimination of laws they say President Sadat promulgated illegally. Liberals Shocked ''The court's action has pitted our feminism against our desire to see all these laws obliterated,'' conceded Nawal Saadawi, a writer and leader of the campaign to restore the amendment. The repeal of the law has shocked liberals, who take pride in Egypt's historical role as a pioneer of the women's rights movement in the Arab world. Even today, said Aisha Rateb, Egypt's first and only female ambassador, who now teaches law at Cairo University, Egyptian women enjoy rights denied women in much of the developing world and in the Persian Gulf. They work in all sectors and are guaranteed equal pay by law. They vote and have been allocated at least 30 seats in the People's Assembly. Women make up 45 percent of university students and 25 percent of university staff, Mrs. Rateb says. Conflict With Koran Is Denied Defenders of the 1979 law dispute the fundamentalist contention that it conflicted with Sharia and the Koran, the holy book of Islam. Some defenders of the law acknowledge privately, but almost never publicly, that the Koran is, as Mr. Baha el-Din put it, ''a man's document.'' In some respects, they concede, the Koran discriminates against women. Men can have up to four wives simultaneously, for example, while women can have only one husband. Female children are entitled to one-half what is due a male heir. Some Egyptians, fearful of being labeled anti-Islamic, argue that the Koran affords women even greater rights than many Western women enjoy. Under Sharia, women keep their father's names in marriage and their own property. They say the Koran, as interpreted in Egyptian law, places so many conditions on polygamy - such as requiring a man to treat all his wives equally - that multiple marriages are virtually impossible. Liberal View Rejected But Egypt's fundamentalists reject the more liberal interpretations of Sharia upon which Egyptian law has traditionally been based. Zenab el-Ghazali, an influential member of the Moslem Brotherhood, maintains that the 1979 statute was anti-Islamic because it effectively penalized men for mulitiple marriages by allowing the courts to intervene and limit his right to take a second wife or divorce his first. ''Only Sharia is acceptable to Moslem women,'' said Mrs. Ghazali, whose late husband was simultaneously married to two other women. Mrs. Ghazali, whose party is part of a coalition that constitutes the only opposition group in Parliament, vowed to oppose Government efforts to pass a substitute law. Under the 1920 and 1929 personal status laws now in effect, with the repeal of the 1979 act, a women no longer need be officially notified if her husband divorces or takes a second wife. No longer is a second marriage automatically grounds for divorce; a woman must once again prove in court that the second marriage has harmed her. Alimony Not Automatic She is no longer entitled to immediate alimony. She no longer automatically wins custody of daughters over the age of 7 and sons over 9. She no longer has the right to remain in her apartment until the father gains custody. Women are already being affected by the court action, as the case of Zakia Ahmed shows. Last March, before the amendments were struck down, Mrs. Ahmed, a mother of four who is about 45 years old, returned to her apartment in Shubra, a poor section, and found her husband ''betraying'' her, as it is said in Arabic, with his secretary, whom he later married. When Mrs. Ahmed refused to leave their home, he attacked her with a knife, inflicting injuries that required hospitalization. She eventually returned home, the only place she had to go, but found her husband's second wife well ensconced there. ''She was sleeping in my bed, wearing my clothes,'' Mrs. Ahmed told a women's meeting two weeks ago, her fury and anguish undiminished. Legal Action Expensive Given the abolition of the 1979 law, if Mrs. Ahmed wishes to take legal action now, she will have to prove injury in a protracted court proceeding that will be difficult for her to afford. Aziza Hussein, a family planning expert, argued that even when the 1979 law was in force, Egypt's conservative traditions and practices discouraged women like Mrs. Ahmed from insisting on their rights. But without the law, women face additional psychological hardships, she said. ''Polygamy is not widespread in Egypt, only about 3 to 4 percent,'' Mrs. Hussein said. ''But most women, especially the lower classes, live in terror that their husbands will take second wives and that they will lose their homes.'' This, in turn, has prompted them to have more children, in order to bolster their standing within the family and to make it more difficult for a husband to support more than one wife. ''Population is Egypt's number one problem,'' said Mrs. Hussein. ''This is more than a woman's issue. Our national interests are at stake.''",1985,"Egypt"
"301","FEMINIST SAYS SEXUAL EQUALITY IN ISRAEL IS ILLUSORY","MENA","On paper, women in Israel seem to have gone far in obtaining equal rights, but appearances are deceptive and discrimination is pervasive, Alice Shalvi, a prominent Israeli feminist, told two groups of American women here yesterday. ''Legislatively, we appear to be far better off, and many of the things you are fighting for, we have already achieved,'' Dr. Shalvi, chairman of the Israel Women's Caucus, told members of the New York Chapter of the American Jewish Committee. She addressed a breakfast and a cross section of feminist activists, writers and academics at a luncheon meeting conducted by the New Israel Fund. The fund, which supports social causes in Israel, is sponsoring Dr. Shalvi's trip to Chicago, New York and Washington. ''We have laws on equal pay for equal work and on paid maternity leaves,'' she said. ''We have an equal opportunity in employment act and an equal education act. We have also had a strong woman Prime Minister, and women serve in our military, so there is a general sense that we have equality.'' But that is not so, Dr. Shalvi said. She Cites the Numbers She is a professor of English at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and principal of the Pelech Religious Experimental High School for Girls, the mother of six and grandmother of seven. In enumerating the forms of discrimination against women, Dr. Shalvi said women had only 10 percent of the seats in Parliament and no Cabinet posts. In the military, she said, women receive different training and are accorded vastly different responsibilties; in the work place, they earn 80 percent of what men do and on television a recent study showed that apart from films they were on screen less than one percent of the viewing time. Americans Agree The American women nodded in recognition. Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the author and Ms. magazine editor, who responded point by point to Dr. Shalvi's luncheon address, said: ''Our famiies still exemplify stereotypical behavior; our men do not come home to start dinner. Our status is still defined pre-eminently by our marital status and by accrued income, which profoundly affects women. We still have the concentrated responsibility for childbearing, and no one expects us to worry about or understand the military.'' One issue on which there are profound differences between the two countries, it was agreed, is divorce. American women are considered to have substantially more rights in courts and to receive more equitable settlements and custody arrangements. ''Divorce is the single burning issue in Israel,'' Dr. Shalvi said, explaining that the rabbinical courts, the only ones empowered to grant divorces, have been increasingly contolled by ''judges from the ultra-Orthodox segment of the religious community, who have not lived in the community at large.'' Although many critics of the system hold Halakha, the body of Jewish law, accountable for divorce inequities, Dr. Shalvi said, ''we don't need change in the Halakha but full implementation of its provisions.'' ''For example, a husband can refuse to give his wife a get, and there is recourse,'' she said, speaking of a religious divorce, ''but it is rarely used. But 100 men, whose wives refused to agree to the get, were granted rabbinical permission to live with and later marry other women without having those marriages considered bigamy or the children they produced illegitimate.'' Two Main Reasons The factors most responsible for the continuing discrimination against women are somewhat different in Israel, too, according to Dr. Shalvi's analysis. ''There are two reasons: the importance of family life and the need for security,'' she said at both meetings. ''We still abide by the division of labor in the home: The husband is the boss or wage earner, the wife is the sole homemaker, even if she contributes to the family income, '' she continued. ''And a woman's status is still determined by the number of children she bears, so that if she has 10 children, she has a higher status than if she has one or two. Those who work outside the home make all sorts of accommodations, such as working part time so that they can meet their obligations at home.'' The other major cause, she said, is the pre-eminence of the military in daily life. ''Right from birth mothers tend to spoil boy babies - with the unexpressed ending in view. She also noted that the emphasis on power and force created an image that was then perpetuated in society at large. Indeed, she said, the pervasive threat of military conflict in the Middle East and the economic problems of Israel have been used by many to sweep women's issues under the rug. ''People say, how can we do anything about women when we have threats of war and economic stress,'' she said. ''Women are just not seen as a crucial issue.''",1986,"Israel"
"302","LIBYA'S WOMEN: ERA OF CHANGE","MENA","Fawzia Abdullah is a 21-year-old first lieutenant at the Women's Military Academy, an extraordinary institution in the Arab world. Like most of her male counterparts, she has been trained to fire Russian-made surface-to-air missiles, to dismantle and reassemble Kalashnikov rifles in less than a minute and to handle recoilless antiaircraft guns. She also plays the bagpipes in the marching band. Her makeup is impeccable, her short fingernails painted with bright crimson polish. She wears fishnet stockings under medium-high-heeled miniboots, and solid gold-drop earrings offset her jet black hair. Her goal, she says, is to win an extra star and become a captain in the Libyan Army, which no Libyan woman has yet accomplished. But, she added with a giggle, ''I would also really like to get married.'' Some things have not changed in revolutionary Libya. Symbol and Reality The military academy - which has trained 7,000 women since its opening in 1978 - is the most prominent symbol of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's drive to make women and men equal, but women in Libya, as elsewhere, remain vastly underrepresented at the top of virtually every part of society. Most women here are still housewives and mothers; few hold prominent jobs in politics or finance. At the same time, Colonel Qaddafi has made considerable strides in improving the status of women in his country and has challenged many of the laws and traditions that have held women back in Arab countries, according to Libyans and other Arab and Western residents here. Women have won considerable rights since Colonel Qaddafi and a small group of junior officers overthrew the monarchy of King Idris in an almost bloodless military coup over 16 years ago. Gains in Education For example, Goverment statistics show a fivefold increase in the number of women enrolled in universities, although male students still outnumber the women three-to-one. Girls and boys now attend primary and preparatory schools in roughly equal numbers. Child brides have been banned, and the minimum legal age for marriage has been set at 18. Women and men now have roughly comparable rights in demanding a divorce. Colonel Qaddafi is pressing the Basic People's Congresses, the units through which Libyans theoretically run their own affairs, to discourage polygamy, which is tolerated by most Arab Islamic countries, by limiting each family to one home. ''These are all radical changes in Arab societies,'' Colonel Qaddafi asserted in a recent interview. Diplomats, Libyans and Western residents say, however, that resistance to such changes remains stubborn in this tribal, male-dominated and highly patriarchal society. ''It's going to take a very long time to change people's ideas,'' said Khadijal el-Jahmy, a former teacher, journalist, Libya's first female newscaster and magazine publisher and a leading and ardent feminist. Like many Libyan women, Mrs. Jahmy, who is 65, could still be considered traditional in a Western sense. She believes strongly that a woman's primary role in life is as a wife, homemaker and mother, she said, and that education makes women more productive and effective in these tasks. To this day, women are vastly underrepresented in the People's Congresses, the cornerstone of Colonel Qaddafi's ''state of the masses,'' and in the General People's Congress, the higher decision-making body to which delegates are elected. In fact, there are no women in a position of authority in this nation of 3.5 million people, half of them women. Colonel Qaddafi's wife, Safiya, shares the disdain of many Libyan women for politics. Halfway through a recent long interview in which Colonel Qaddafi was elaborating on his political views and foreign policy, she grew visibly bored and left the room. But she was not given much chance to participate. Her husband answered almost every question directed in English or Arabic to his wife. A student nurse and only 15 years old when she met the young leader of the revolution in a hospital where he was recovering from appendicitis, Mrs. Qaddafi chose to pursue the traditional Libyan woman's role of wife and homemaker rather than her nursing career. With seven children, she has time for little else, she said. Colonel Qaddafi, on the other hand, wants his children, especially his only daughter, Aisha, to become doctors and perpetuators of his revolution. The Libyan leader has faced the stiffest resistance of all to his vision of mobilizing every woman, as well as men, in the defense of the country. Libyans have been openly hostile to mandatory military training for high school girls and to the military academies in particular. ''Libyans simply don't want their daughters running around in pants and toting AK-47 rifles,'' one diplomat said. Many Libyan families have even refused to send their daughters to high school to avoid compulsory military training, he said. A Religious Obstacle Another source of resistance to the colonel's revolutionary ideas about the status of women is Islam. Many Libyans, still a deeply religious people, believe that women must cover their heads for modesty as required by the Koran and be subservient to the heads of their households. Even Colonel Qaddafi has been wary of challenging the conservative sexual mores of his people, rooted partly in their interpretation of Islam. Adultery in Libya is punishable by public flogging. An unwed mother is sent to prison if the father of her child refuses to marry her. Abortion is illegal and contraception discouraged. ''We need more children in this vast country,'' Mrs. Jahmy asserted, vehemently defending restrictions on a woman's control of her body, which is a hallmark of the feminist struggle in the Western world. Aggravated by repeated rebuffs from his traditional citizens, Colonel Qaddafi has focused most of his revolutionary proselytizing on the young. At many public appearances, he surrounds himself mainly with gun-toting female revolutionary guards. One Dedicated Activist ''He's just given up on the older folks,'' one Libyan asserted. ''But kids now 17 and under are far more malleable. They don't remember a life before the revolution.'' It is from the young that Colonel Qaddafi has formed his revolutionary committees and guards, an elite who constitute what he has dubbed the vanguard of the revolution. The colonel has come increasingly to depend on them as the hope for his Government, residents say. One such activist is Fatiya Zakkah, 32, the mother of three. She is an unpaid worker in Colonel Qaddafi's office. She was 15 when the revolution came, she said. Inspired by its goals and dreams, she joined the Arab Socialist Union at school, where she was noticed by Colonel Qaddafi, who asked her to work for him. She is totally devoted to Mr. Qaddafi, Arab socialism and the victory of ''progressive democracy.'' For her, there is no contradiction between Islam and the colonel's revolution. Although she does not cover her head, as do many Libyan women, even those of the military academy, she has made the haj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that every pious Moslem must make at least once. ''I dress modestly for Islam,'' she said. ''But I would willingly take off all my clothes and run naked into battle in defense of my country.''",1986,"Libya"

Free for whom, free from what?  Not only are the four Shiite Muslim Afghan groups based in Iran not consulted in this supposedly democratic process, let alone the Afghans who support the Kabul Government, but also Afghan women are conspicuously without voice in formation of a ''cabinet.'' A theology professor has been named ''acting prime minister.'' He is backed by Saudi Arabia, and you describe him as ''a strict fundamentalist who opposes educating women and refuses to give interviews to journalists who are women.'' Nor were women heard in the choice of the fundamentalist who would head the justice ministry. Justice for whom? Women in the United States who knew the rebels' resistance toward women's rights winced at the euphemism ''freedom fighters.'' They must now feel doubly affronted on behalf of their Afghan sisters, who will be forced to live in ''a free Muslim state,'' which interprets the Koran's teachings in a way that abjures gender parity even at elementary levels of education and occupation, let alone government leadership. If there is to be any freedom in the proposed theocracy, which our tax dollars have fed, it is surely not for the female half of Afghanistan's population. What can be done? Would not the proposed ''free Muslim state'' of Afghanistan be appropriate for the spotlight that women's organizations can throw on gross violations of women's rights? ROSE M.

"305","A SPIRITED ISRAELI-AMERICAN DIALOGUE ON WOMEN'S ISSUES OPENS IN JERUSALEM","MENA","Betty Friedan did not exactly keep to the subject Monday night when she helped to open an Israeli-American dialogue here on the status of Jewish women, but her account of the women's movement in the United States was what the audience seemed to want to hear. They laughed and shouted approval at the feminist's often biting account, and then during a lively question period demanded that the remainder of what was to be a dialogue of experts at the Van Leer Jerusalem Foundation be opened to the public. Many of the questioners had indicated frustration over what they seemed to feel was a largely male- dominated Israeli religious and secular society. What started as an academic gathering was becoming a rap session. Theodore R. Mann, president of the American Jewish Congress, sponsor of the gathering, said that while ''three to four times'' the 300-member audience had been turned away, opening the sessions would break a 20-year tradition of the dialogues. At that point, Elizabeth Holtzman, the Brooklyn District Attorney, rose from the audience to take up the pleas of those who wanted the entire session opened. Miss Holtzman, who will be a panelist later in the week, said that ''we learned from each other'' in the women's movement in the United States and that it would be unfortunate ''with all the energy in this room to shut the doors on each other.'' Tradition can be changed ''very quickly,'' she said. And so it was, through closed-circuit television, at least for the moment. The dialogue, entitled ''Woman as Jew; Jew as Woman, an Urgent Inquiry,'' will end on Thursday with a discussion about women in politics. Prof. Rivka W. Bar-Yosef of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the first adviser to the Prime Minister on the status of women, noted some of the contradictions in Israeli society regarding women as she opened the session. The status of women in Israel is ''not yet central to the great majority of political parties,'' she said, although it becomes relevant in terms of legislation on such matters as abortion, equal pay and political representation, ''the recent election providing a depressing example.'' She was referring to the relatively few women in Parliament, nine out of 120. But the major restrictions for Israeli women came in the religious field, she said, referring to the segregation of women and men, the lack of women's access to the higher levels of education, the exclusion of women from any judicial role in the rabbinate and the asymmetrical status of men and women in the family. Although these are elements of orthodoxy, she said, their impact is felt outside the religious area because of the overlapping of the religious and the secular. For example, women cannot appear as witnesses before religious courts, which have exclusive status in nearly all family matters here, nor can women serve as judicial personnel. And although there are women who are judges in civil courts, they cannot try divorce cases, she said. The Army, according to Professor Bar- Yosef, is supposed to play a role in the integration of women, but religious women can avoid conscription. How paradoxical, she said, that those who serve ''are labeled as deficient in Jewishness'' when compared with those who ''declare themselves observant and therefore can start their careers.'' Mrs. Friedan recounted her own experience with women in the Army during a tour of a military base earlier in the day. She spoke of seeing a female soldier parachuting but being told that her regular job was packing parachutes. The feminist leader spoke of her first trip to Israel ''where to my amazement I was regarded as a leper and Golda wouldn't see me,'' she said, referring to the late Prime Minister Golda Meir. ''It was hopeless here.'' Later she found that ''things were changing'' but that the Jewish community ''and its male leaders had been threatened.'' She insisted, however, that ''feminism is not the enemy of the family because the liberation of the woman is essential to the strength and evolution of the family.'' She rebuked some major Jewish organizations for what she indicated was their unwillingness to deal with women's issues. ''I was told it would cost too much to deal with day care, so I asked how much does a stained- glass window cost?'' Mrs. Friedan was alternately entertaining, talking about ''pot-luck seders'' for the liberated woman, and serious, saying that American women still received only 62 cents compared with the dollar paid to men for the same work. That prompted a debate in the hall, with shouted estimates. Finally, the consensus was that the equivalent Israeli figure was about 70 cents. An American woman in the audience said her daughter felt ''dismissed'' here, and she asked if that was the case generally. She was told that was a common impression among American women in Israel. An Israeli woman spoke with some despair of the increasing strength of the religious political parties in last week's election and how their gains affect women's rights. ''Is there any hope?'' she asked. Professor Bar-Yosef said there was: ''Things are moving from below.'' A women's movement gained some strength here in the 1970's, lobbying for legislation on women's issues, but it split after 1977 in a dispute about forming a women's party. ''We need a forum,'' one woman shouted. But another got up to say that a feminist conference had convened each year for the last six years and ''there are groups in every city, although the one in Haifa closed down,'' she said, ''for lack of interest.''",1984,"Israel"
"306","WOMEN ON THE FIRING LINE","MENA","Hosannas to Betty Friedan and Elizabeth Holtzman. Theirs was a timely presentation of women's rights at the American Jewish Congress in Israel last August.

However, it is not enough to receive promises of a ''network of Jewish women'' oblivious to ''political, religious and national lines.'' This thrust must be pursued with intelligence and persistence. Other women must join to give meaning to this much needed recognition of equality for both sexes. ANNA BEDER Hollis, N.Y.",1984,"Israel"

"309","Afghan Peace Could Herald War of Sexes","MENA","Masooma Esmatee Wardak said that as a woman she was not afraid of the day when the Islamic conservatives who are now in exile in Pakistan or Iran come back to Afghanistan. ''It will be difficult,'' she said, and added, ''for both sides.'' Mrs. Wardak is president of the Women's Council of Afghanistan. Once a Communist group, the women's branch of the ruling People's Democratic Party, the organization has been broadened under the present policy of ''national reconciliation.'' The regime of President Najibullah proclaimed this policy last year as part of its efforts to obtain a political compromise to end the war that would salvage a Communist role. To her surprise, Mrs. Wardak was invited to head the new women's organization, replacing a woman who was a military officer. The 58-year-old geographer and writer is not a Communist. In fact, her husband, an American-educated physicist, was jailed for five months when the Communists seized power in 1979 because he had been a Cabinet minister in the old regime. ''My brother was also in jail, but now he is in California,'' she added matter of factly. ''He cannot do anything because they beat him too much. They have broken his morale, so he is there. Sometimes he is at home, sometimes he is in the hospital.'' An Authentic Feminist Mrs. Wardak was clearly chosen, despite her old-regime background and her many relatives, including a son, in the West, because she is an authentic feminist. One of the first female members of Parliament under the monarchy, which was overthrown in 1973, she was also among the first women to hold responsible government posts. She joined the Education Ministry in 1959. Mrs. Wardak shares a concern felt by women of modern ways among the more than three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. They fear that fundamentalist mullahs, or religious leaders, among the seven parties of the resistance alliance based in Peshawar want to turn back the clock on women's rights when they return to leading positions in this country. Mullahs have imposed strict confinement to the house or tent on the vast majority of refugee women and girls and severely limited their access to medical care and education provided by international agencies. ''I am quite optimistic,'' Mrs. Wardak said, in English that she learned largely during a year of study in 1958 at the National College of Education in Evanston, Ill. ''If the situation goes backward, we will fight for it. We can fight with the mullahs through the holy Koran. ''If you can find some place in the Koran for me where it is written that the woman cannot go out, O.K., I'll stay home. But there is no such place there.'' The 'Mourningful' Women But Mrs. Wardak fears that equality for women is likely to take a significant step backward toward polygamy when the war ends. She said the practice that allows Muslim men to take four wives had been eliminated even before the Communist revolution. But she said that with the great number of war widows and an Afghan tradition obliging men to marry their brothers' widows, the practice would spread again. ''The Afghan women, they have suffered very much from this crazy war,'' Mrs. Wardak said. ''They have lost their husbands, they have lost their sons. In the provinces, they have lost their houses, all equipment, everything that they had. So when you see them, some of them, they are very much mourningful.'' So vivid was Mrs. Wardak's evocation of suffering that the word she had coined seemed to justify itself. At the same time, she said, women have steadily gained in equality since 1959, when, as she said, ''we were unveiled.'' About 270,000 women today have what she called ''outdoor jobs.'' By this she meant women who have left confinement to their homes to go to work in offices and factories. ''Eighty percent of the other women are in the country, working in the fields,'' she continued. ''So there are left only a few women whose families are quiet prejudiced and don't let them work.'' Women's Working Power Mrs. Wardak believes that the working power of women will be the main force against turning back the clock, no matter how much fundamentalists might want to do so. ''I know many, many women, thousands of women, who have lost their husbands,'' she said. ''They are working. Who is going to pay for their lives? I think it's no more so very easy to push the women to stay in their houses.'' Mrs. Wardak referred to her own experience. ''When I went to the United States, I was covered,'' she said. ''I had the chador with me when I went in the plane. I took it off and gave it to somebody to take home. But when I came back from the States, I was sitting in the plane until they brought it for me. I put it back on.'' But the next year, she said, women were freed from the veil. ''I can tell you that I will never put on again the chador,'' she said with feeling. ''No, we'll fight for it. I don't want to be told again to stay at home.'' Mrs. Wardak reiterated her optimism that women's rights would prevail in a new, postwar Afghanistan. ''It takes a long time to enlighten the men,'' she said. ''But the next Afghanistan will come. It will come with new hopes.''",1988,"Afghanistan"
"310","Cairo Journal; Egypt's Pain: Wives Killing Husbands","MENA","When the newspapers here began chronicling a series of attacks in which women killed their husbands, the stories seized the headlines and stirred some debate about the future of a land where no transition seems easy. As the newspapers had it, a woman identified only as Samiha cut her husband into 10 pieces for easy disposal; another identified as Rabaa took a butcher's knife and beheaded her spouse while he bowed in prayer to Allah; and Mona stabbed her husband 20 times in the chest to avenge his brutality toward her. The accounts were followed by a cartoon of a peculiarly Egyptian nature: a bureaucrat was depicted sleeping at his desk, as many here expect bureaucrats to do. But his somnolence is explained by the husband-killings: he dare not sleep at home lest he suffer the fate of the others. Such levity stirred the ire of feminists, who saw it as merely a further example of men making light of the kind of agony that can drive a woman to kill her spouse. And, as the public debate over the killings has revealed, many social commentators see the killings as expressions of a profound social malaise tied to the changes that Egypt and much of the Arab world have undergone in recent decades, an era marked by the rapid expansion of wealth and poverty, personal mobility, population growth and urbanization. 'No Emotional Relationship' ''We are at a crossroads,'' said Dr. Hoda Badran, a leading campaigner for women's rights who is secretary general of the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood. ''And there are a lot of contradictions.'' For Egypt, the questioning of the lot of women is only one of a series of social issues that have raised questions about the decay of a modern society adrift from old values and subject to increasing drug abuse, petty crime and dislocation. ''There is no dialogue or understanding inside the family or between the husband and his wife,'' said Dr. Yousry Abdel Mohsen, a professor of psychology at Cairo University. ''There is no emotional relationship that ties them. Instead, there is a new language of money, self-interest, usury.'' The discussion also touches on the Islamic revival that has prompted many women here to withdraw from Western styles and return to the veil - Islam's traditional means of showing female piety by avoiding styles of dress that might stir illicit passion. Oil and Economic Upheaval The Islamic revival has been prompted by economic decline and a sense of a social transition. It has also given more authority to men, permitting them to use Islam's strictures on the modesty of women as a brake on advancement for women, despite Koranic injunctions and other Muslim rulings stressing sexual equality. Some trace the emergence of tensions between men and women to the 1970's, when the results of Egypt's revolution 20 years earlier began to show. The revolution guaranteed free college education, but other dynamics were at work. Jihan Sadat, the wife of the late President Anwar el-Sadat, was viewed as a particularly forceful example of a modern Egyptian woman campaigning for women's rights. ''Suddenly women were doing men's jobs,'' said Dr. Badran, who runs an office where many of her underlings are men. ''There were women director generals in four government ministries, and men objected.'' At the same time, economic upheaval brought further upheaval. President Sadat freed Egyptian men to travel to the oil-producing states of the Persian Gulf to seek a slice of the oil wealth that followed the price increases of the early 70's. And that had an impact on the women who were left behind. 'A Reaction Against Women' While the men were away at work, Dr. Badran said, ''rural women had responsibilities they did not have before, hiring labor to work, discussing local matters, handling the money their husbands sent home.'' In the same period, a migration from the countryside to places like Cairo and Alexandria swelled Egypt's urban population. Women ''lost their well-defined role in the fields and in the home'' and began doing domestic work or curbside vending to supplement the family income, Dr. Badran said. ''The Egyptian woman, and the Eastern woman in general, is suffering from a role conflict,'' said Dr. Madiha el-Safty, a professor of sociology at the American University in Cairo. ''On one hand, she is the modern working woman and on the other, she is still the traditional housewife.'' But such changes have not been matched by a corresponding improvement in status, and men remain suspicious of advancement by women, Dr. Badran said. ''There's a reaction against women,'' she said. ''If there's unemployment, it's because women are taking jobs. If there's delinquency, it's because women are leaving the home to work. If there's no room on the buses, it's because women are filling them on their way to work.'' Modern Times and Marital Law The marital law - a fundamental issue - has not kept up with Egypt's modern realities. Many marriages are still arranged by relatives, with the woman's consent assumed. And men, who have a legal right to polygamy, may divorce their wives simply by saying ''I divorce you'' three times. The wife is not necessarily informed of his actions until later. Women may petition for divorce but are not guaranteed a separation if the husband rejects her action. It is such legislation, said Dr. Nawal el-Saadawy, a leading feminist, that lies behind the spate of husband-killings. ''Rabaa killed her husband when she found no other way of stopping him marrying another woman after 13 years of marriage,'' she said, referring to the woman who decapitated her husband. By some standards of the Arab world, Egypt's women are freer than most. Women in Saudi Arabia, for instance, may not drive cars, and a full veil is the norm in the Persian Gulf littoral states. Some of the gains of Egyptian women seem threatened, too. A change in electoral practice in 1987 reduced the number of seats held by women in the 448-member legislature from 33 to 18. Dr. Badran said the growth of an independent women's movement has been stifled since the 1952 revolution brought all political organization under the control of the authorities. But others sense a new groundswell of change among women. ''In the past, women used to abide by the rules,'' Dr. Saadway said. ''But now life is changing. Women slaves are revolting and asking for some of their rights.''",1989,"Egypt"
"311","Is This What We Went to War For?","MENA","I saw a movie last weekend in which Elizabeth Taylor played a fading movie star who fell in love with Robert Wagner, a charming, wealthy real estate mogul. Unfortunately, he turned out to be broke, married and a drinker. The moral of that story was that you should get to know as much as you can about someone before you marry them. The same could be said for some of the international partners we've been crawling into bed with. Remember how Kuwait was portrayed during the buildup to the Persian Gulf War? It was, we were told, one of the more enlightened and progressive countries in the Middle East. Its diplomats, whom we got to know like friends, thanks to extensive television coverage, came across as thoughtful, civilized people, in exquisite contrast to Saddam Hussein, the Mideast's premier bully. After the war was over, however, we started finding out more about our new best friend. Jack Kelley of USA Today exposed how Kuwaiti society now shuns the Kuwaiti women who were raped by Iraqi soldiers. Those who were raped could not get abortions. Many were suicidal. More recently, we have found out about the hundreds of female domestics from the Third World who have taken refuge in their embassies in Kuwait City after their Kuwaiti employers beat and raped them and then held onto their passports. Kuwait also is the only country in the world that extends voting privileges to certain citizens, but prohibits all women from voting. Is this what we went to war for? Arvonne Fraser, a senior fellow at the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs and director of the International Women's Rights Action Watch, said: ""Kuwait is enlightened in the sense [that] they buy fancy cars and all the modern goods. But enlightenment in my terms is in your head. I don't call this enlightenment. I call it degradation of women, and it offends me that my country thinks oil is more important than women."" Fraser noted that the State Department has added a section to its annual report on human rights around the globe documenting violations of the rights of women. But, she added, ""Then we don't do much about our information. I think it is a remnant of the Cold War mentality. We don't worry about the security of women. We worry about the security of the country. But countries are made up of people."" A recent United Nations' publication reported that in a survey of 153 Kuwaiti women, one-third said they had been assaulted and 80 percent said they had friends or relatives who had been. The publication contained other troubling snapshots of the way women are treated in countries with which we do business. In India, registered cases of women being killed in disputes over their dowries soared from 999 in 1985 to 1,786 in 1987. In Austria, violence against the wives was cited as a contributing factor in 59 percent of 1,500 divorce cases that were reviewed. Closer to home, the U.N. publication noted that in the United States, 3 million to 4 million women are estimated to be the victims of domestic violence each year. And yet we are considered among the most progressive nations in the world in the treatment of women. In 1979, the U.N. General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. President Carter sent it to the Senate for ratification. It has languished in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ever since because the Reagan and Bush administrations have not sought its ratification. Meanwhile, 110 other countries have ratified the convention. Although U.S. ratification of the convention would be largely symbolic, it would enable this country to be a member of the expert group that annually reviews reports from other ratifying countries on the progress they are making in eliminating discrimination against women. Without ratification, the United States has no credible voice in international arenas to raise convention-based complaints about the treatment of women around the world. Kuwait, it is worth noting, is another country that has not ratified the convention. Fraser said violence against women is becoming a topic that men and women increasingly are willing to talk about worldwide. ""We're going to see some action, but we've got to talk a lot more about it,"" she predicted. Senate approval of the Women's Convention not only would let us join the conversation, but would give U.S. citizens a standard for evaluating the human rights record of nations who are seeking our help -- before we're forced into a shotgun wedding.",1992,"Kuwait"
"312","Egyptian Court Overturns Decree That Banned Female Circumcision","MENA","An administrative court struck down a government ban on the widely practiced ritual known as female circumcision today, dealing a blow to human rights activists who have argued that the procedure is cruel, unnecessary and damaging to women's sexual and reproductive health. The ruling was a victory for Islamic fundamentalists who claim that female circumcision -- called female genital mutilation by its critics -- protects women from what they consider the consequences of excessive sexual desire as well as sexually transmitted diseases and other maladies. It also demonstrated the continued influence of Islamic fundamentalists within Egyptian courts, whose conservative rulings on social and religious issues are often at odds with the views of secular-minded ministers in the military-backed government of President Hosni Mubarak. Today's ruling, which prompted cheers from the predominantly male audience, overturned a decree last July by Health Minister Ismail Sallam banning doctors from performing the operation, which involves the full or partial removal of the clitoris on girls before they reach puberty. ""I feel joyful,"" Sheik Yusef Badry, a conservative Islamic cleric who sued to overturn the ban, said in a telephone interview this evening. ""The judge returned to Islam, and he recognized that [the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad] ordered Muslims to do this operation. . . . A woman can enjoy her sexual feelings with her husband, but if we cut off this piece, she will be able to control herself."" Badry was joined in the lawsuit by Munir Fawzi, a British-trained gynecologist and professor at Cairo's Ain Shams University who defends the practice on both religious and medical grounds. Although it overturned the government decree, the mid-level court did not rule out a ban on female circumcision, saying that parliament could enact such a law. But human rights activists said parliament is unlikely to do so, given the continued popularity of the practice, and they vowed to appeal the ruling to the Egyptian Supreme Court. Female circumcision is common in sub-Saharan Africa and in Egypt, where 97 percent of married women between the ages of 15 and 49 have undergone the procedure, according to a government survey conducted last year with funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development. Many Muslim scholars, however, argue that the practice has no basis in Islamic doctrine, noting that in Egypt it dates to pharaonic times, centuries before the advent of Islam, and is virtually unknown in such conservative Islamic societies as Saudi Arabia and Iran. Egypt and other developing countries have come under growing international pressure to curb female circumcision, which often is performed on girls as young as 3. Besides being traumatic and potentially dangerous -- especially when performed by unqualified practitioners, such as barbers -- the procedure has been linked to problems in childbirth and sexual relations. The government promised to take action in 1994, after CNN broadcast footage of a screaming 13-year-old girl undergoing the procedure at the hands of a Cairo barber. But it soon ran into opposition from Gad Haq Ali Gad Haq, then Egypt's senior religious figure and the sheik of Cairo's Al Azhar University, who warned that ""girls who are not circumcised when young have a sharp temperament and bad habits."" The health minister at the time, Ali Fattah, responded by banning the procedure in public hospitals, but not private ones. Sallam, his successor, then tried to close that loophole, announcing last July that no licensed medical professional could perform the procedure. The decree prompted the lawsuit by Badry and Fawzi, who asserted that female circumcision, if done properly, is ""a very minor sort of operation"" that leaves the clitoris essentially intact. Moreover, they said, the government ban would only have the effect of driving the practice underground, creating unnecessary trauma and health risks for girls. Human rights activists said tonight that they were disappointed but not surprised. ""We knew that the country was not ready for such a decree,"" said Marie Assad, director of the Female Genital Mutilation Task Force. ""We need more education, more research, more mobilizing.""",1997,"Egypt"
"313","Women in Combat: The Opposing View","MENA","The article ""A Trench Between Women, Jobs"" [front page, Dec. 28] presents the feminist view of ""women in combat,"" omits any opposing arguments and even fails to acknowledge that a reasonable opposing viewpoint exists. Four points need to be made: First, three millennia of military history have proven that armies require an esprit that is built and maintained through the special cohesion that develops among males under difficult circumstances. When Medal of Honor recipients have been asked what motivated them to heroism, the most common response is: ""I did it for my buddies,"" as opposed to for ""my country,"" ""my army,"" ""my God,"" etc. Second, some empirical information may help to balance the discussion. In the first Arab-Israeli War in 1948, the Israeli army, due to severe manpower shortages, assigned women to combat roles, with disastrous results. The male soldiers were disproportionately concerned with the welfare of their female counterparts to the detriment of the unit as a whole. Furthermore, some Arab units continued fighting under desperate conditions because they thought it dishonorable to surrender to female soldiers. Third, the Army conducted a study of gender in basic training companies in the early 1980s. There were three test groups: companies composed only of men, companies composed only of women and mixed companies. The men-only companies performed best, in just about all of the basic soldiering tasks (not only the merely physical), and the women-only units performed somewhat worse. In the mixed-gender companies, the women performed better than they did in women-only units, but the men performed worse than they did in men-only units. Since less than 20 percent of the Army is composed of women, logic dictates that the men be kept in male-only units as much as possible in order to maximize results. Finally, your article omitted a critical fact: Studies have shown that enlisted women in the Army do not want to serve in combat roles; it is predominantly feminists without military experience who claim to speak for these women, but they apparently have no desire to learn what their supposed ""constituency"" really wants. Promotions come faster to those who serve in combat roles, but (enlisted) Army women are mostly not interested in these positions. If statistics show that women are not promoted as quickly as men in the Army, it is therefore not indicative of a conspiracy. A commander in the U.S. Army has precious little time and resources with which to train soldiers. Should the commander spend all of this time trying to alter the manner in which men and women are genetically or socially prone to interact with one another, or should the commander use this time to train soldiers to fight and win wars and stay alive while doing so? -- Thomas Manzi",1998,"Israel"
"314","Women in Egypt Gain Broader Divorce Rights; Wide Coalition Pushed for Legal Equality","MENA","The trouble in Saba Wahad's marriage started right away. Wahad, 24, said her husband, a colleague of her brother's, hit her at the slightest provocation and became increasingly volatile with the birth of two children and mounting financial pressure. ""I had no idea he would be like this,"" said Wahad, whose marriage nearly two years ago, like many matches in the Middle East, was arranged by her family with no time for courtship. In another era, Wahad's choices would be grim: Tolerate the violence or seek divorce through a court system that demanded women provide exacting proof of abuse, adultery or some other reason for dissolving a union, while giving men appeal rights that took years to exhaust. Today, however, she and other Egyptian women are coming to court with new authority. A law that took effect last month allows them to seek a unilateral, no-questions-asked divorce, making Egypt the second country in the Arab world after Tunisia to give women divorce rights similar to those of men. ""This is basically a revolution,"" said Mona Zulfukar, a lawyer and activist who helped win a 15-year campaign for family law reform that also made child support and alimony easier to collect and consolidated what sometimes grew to be a file of seven or eight separate proceedings under the purview of a single judge. ""The mechanics were archaic and outdated. . . . Cases stayed in there for five, seven, 10 years to be resolved,"" Zulfukar said. ""Women were suffering like mad."" Having survived a bitter debate that drew frequent predictions--from men--that domestic upheaval would inevitably follow such a change, the new Egyptian divorce law demonstrated how difficult social reform can be when faith, politics and culture reinforce the status quo. Women's rights are a particularly sensitive topic in the Middle East, governed by traditions and religious practices that have justified a range of rules, restrictions and customs--from what can be worn outside the home, to prohibitions on driving and work, to female circumcision and the killing of wives, sisters and daughters who stain family honor. Support from national leaders is no guarantee of change. In Jordan, the lower house of parliament has refused, despite the support of King Abdullah, to eliminate laws that minimize jail time for men who commit ""honor killings."" The emir of Kuwait tried to extend the right to vote to women last year, but the idea was rejected by the legislature. In Egypt, it took a diverse coalition to make reform possible, including President Hosni Mubarak, whose wife has been active on social reform issues. Also involved were activists interested in making the legal system more efficient; civil libertarians and supporters of women's rights; and, perhaps most important, Muslim scholars who agreed there was justification within Islam for the proposed changes. ""The whole thing is a cultural struggle today; it is not men against women,"" said Mona Makram Ebeid, a former member of parliament and a political scientist at the American University of Cairo. ""It's a struggle between the conservative element and the civil society."" It was in fact the justification of the new law on religious grounds that won it approval in this often devout nation, where family law in particular is supposed to be rooted in the sharia, or Islamic code. Divorce, Egyptian activists argued, was clearly meant by the Prophet Mohammed to be an equal--or at least nearly equal--opportunity for men and women to dissolve unhappy marriages. Scholars at Cairo's Al Azhar University, the Muslim world's oldest seat of religious learning, agreed. With Lebanon already studying the statute as a possible model for expanded divorce rights for women there, supporters feel they have found a formula that can overcome tradition, and without the upheaval often predicted in the Middle East when arguments are made in favor of social change. It is the second major step on women's issues that Egypt has approved in recent months. Last fall, the government repealed a controversial part of the criminal code that allowed rapists to avoid imprisonment if they offered to marry their victims. During the six weeks the law has been on the books, about 300 women have used it to initiate proceedings. According to Egyptian government statistics, about 290,000 people get divorced here each year. In Cairo, where about one-fifth of Egypt's more than 60 million people live, roughly 15,000 women file for divorce annually. Opposition from religious conservatives and men who saw their domination of family life threatened required some compromise. As the legislation progressed, a provision allowing Egyptian women to travel without a husband's or father's permission was eliminated as too daring. And even with the recent reforms, a husband can still break a marriage far more easily than a wife. As little as an hour with the local marriage registrar is all it takes under the broad divorce powers given to men. The wife does not have to be informed. Under the new law, by contrast, court-supervised mediation is required before a divorce is granted at the woman's request, and then she must return any cash or property provided by her husband under their marriage contract. Nevertheless, Wahad and other women said, the new law has given them hope that if the courts tie up a case too long examining a woman's claims--it is still preferable to prove cause, if only to retain the marriage payment Egyptian men often bring to a new union--they can opt for a quick exit under the new statute. ""We are going to take this all the way through, but if the courts drag we will use the Khola,"" said Wahad's lawyer, Wahed Azmy, using the Koranic name for the new law.",2000,"Egypt"
"315","Iran's Women Say Yes to Khatami; Many Will Vote for Him Today but Wonder if He Can Reform System","MENA","In a magazine interview during his first days as president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami was asked who had the final word in his household -- he or his wife. ""I do,"" Khatami replied. ""And it's 'Yes, Madam!' "" It was just the kind of against-the-grain comment in this strict Islamic society that has endeared Khatami to Iranian women who, along with the country's youth vote, propelled him to an overwhelming victory four years ago. When Iranians go to the polls Friday, women -- the segment of society that arguably has benefited most from Khatami's presidency -- are again expected to be a powerful source of support in his anticipated reelection over nine mostly conservative rivals. Under Khatami's leadership, women have made unprecedented gains in a country where conservative clerics have used their rigid interpretation of Islam for the past 22 years to impose stringent dress codes, rules of behavior, career limitations and domestic control over women. Khatami has put record numbers of women in senior advisory positions in his government, expanded opportunities that allowed women this year to claim 60 percent of the seats in universities and facilitated liberties in dress and social conduct that would have gotten women and girls arrested four years ago. ""Mr. Khatami has changed the psychological atmosphere of the society concerning women and men,"" said Elahe Koolaee, one of the 11 female members of Iran's parliament and a Khatami supporter. ""These changes are very important."" ""The first words he used in his campaign were support for women's rights and freedom,"" said Firoozeh Parchni, 25, a university student who said she will vote to reelect him. ""Iranian society is a man's society, and we want to share it. We want to be able to show what we want. We're sick of censorship."" But like much of his ambitious reform program, many of Khatami's efforts to make significant changes in the laws and institutions that govern women's lives have been thwarted by hard-line conservatives who consider maintaining the traditional views of a woman's place in Islamic society a critical firewall against encroachment by undesireable Western influences. Although Iran's elected parliament, called the Majlis, is controlled by reformists and has passed groundbreaking legislation granting greater rights to women in divorce cases, education and other areas, most bills have been vetoed by the Guardian Council, an appointive body of 12 conservative Islamic scholars and clerics that reviews all laws for adherence to Islamic principles. And while the reform movement has tried to open the workplace to more women, Khatami's term has been marked by an economic downturn that has pushed unemployment to 25 percent. Economists estimate that as few as 10 percent of women graduating from college can find jobs. As a result, while women can now nudge their scarves farther back on their heads, hold hands with their boyfriends on the streets of upscale neighborhoods and wear makeup in public without harassment from the morals police, they are becoming increasingly disheartened by the failures of the reform movement. ""I know he's the right person, but I'm really frustrated -- 100 percent,"" said Masourmeh Farrokhi, 20, a psychology student at Tehran University. ""He hasn't been given the opportunity to make changes, and people wanted really big, fundamental changes. You can't say a certain body is to blame. There are numerous actors -- [it's] the entire atmosphere of the country."" Other women are even harsher in their assessments and are joining the growing chorus of voices questioning the religious system of government installed after the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew Iran's Western-backed monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. ""We brought Khatami in to change the system and nothing happened,"" said Rosa Omidvar, 25, a kindergarten director who said she will not vote. ""The only thing I want is real freedom, the kind where you feel in your heart that you are a free member of society."" Khatami conceded in a news conference this week that ""we have not been able yet to respect the rights and talents of women to the extent they deserve."" Iranian women are permitted greater freedoms than women in some neighboring Islamic countries, yet the country's religious laws and codes are criticized harshly by women's rights proponents both inside and outside the country. A woman's testimony carries only half the credibility of a man's in court; laws governing divorce, child custody and family matters place nearly all authority in the hands of husbands and fathers; and the ""blood money"" paid by a murderer to a victim's family in lieu of receiving the death penalty is half the amount for a woman as a man. Punishments for morals violations remain harsh, as evidenced last month when a 35-year-old woman was buried up to her armpits and stoned to death on charges of producing and acting in pornographic films eight years ago. ""What's the problem?"" said Grand Ayatollah Yousef Saanei, a high-ranking liberal cleric who has advocated equal rights for women. ""I answer with one word: tradition."" He added: ""Those who aim at enslaving women . . . are fighting awareness among the people because they are frightened. . . . Later, the people will raise criticisms against their deeds and their performance, and they will start hating these rulers."" The strong support women have given Khatami has spurred some conservative politicians and clerics to begin rethinking the role of women in Islamic society. ""The time is past when men preached that women are the leftovers of the universe,"" said Mohammad Javad Larijani, a leading theoretician of Iran's right wing. ""Now we are facing educated women demanding jobs and recognition."" Some of the toughest battles over women's rights have been fought between parliament and the Guardian Council. The council has used its veto power on bills ranging from raising the marriage age of girls from 9 to 14 without court approval to giving women more rights in divorce cases. Zahra Eshraqi, 38, has been in the forefront of that issue and others as a director of policymaking in the Interior Ministry's Office for Women's Affairs. She came to the job with a unique background: Eshraqi is the granddaughter of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini -- the Islamic republic's most revered leader -- and the wife of the president's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, a leading member of parliament. She said the council has obstructed bills expanding women's rights ""because of the traditional way they've been thinking. Someone should tell them their thought is wrong. People in society are against it and it should be thrown away."" Fatemeh Haqiqatjoo, a legislator who was arrested for a speech she made on the floor of the parliament criticizing the brutal treatment of a female journalist by police, said she is encouraged by the increased participation of women both at high levels of Khatami's administration and in rural villages and small cities. Reformers have helped push implementation of long-ignored laws against discrimination that have resulted, for instance, in 781 women being elected to village and city councils across Iran during Khatami's first term. ""There used to be such a masculine look in those cities,"" Haqiqatjoo said, her voice raspy from spending several days campaigning for Khatami. ""Now women are participating more and people are looking up to them."" But it's not only conservative government councils and village men who question some of the social changes Khatami and other reformers advocate. ""Khatami has given a lot of freedoms, but he has been going too far,"" said Tahereh Horri, a 41-year-old mother of three who lives in Islamshahr, about an hour's drive south of Tehran. ""Girls and boys don't observe the moralities. This is no good. Go to the park and have a look!"" Correspondent John Ward Anderson contributed to this report.",2001,"Iran"
"316","When Women Cannot Choose","MENA","In case anyone has forgotten the misery of Afghan women, the Feminist Majority's Web site is offering for sale swatches of burqa. You can buy a single swatch for $ 5. (A whole burqa would cost you $ 25 in the markets of Kabul and Kandahar.) ""This swatch of mesh represents the obstructed view of the world for an entire nation of women who were once free,"" the Feminist Majority gifts page says. ""Wear it in remembrance -- so that we do not forget the women and girls of Afghanistan until their right to work, freedom of movement, education, and health care are restored and they are free once again."" It's a real shame that the Feminist Majority resorted to this, because it was warning of the horrors of life under Taliban rule long before Afghan women became the pet project of every leader and his wife. But the swatches are as ludicrous as the obsession of every news show and magazine with getting a shot of an ""Afghan woman lifting up her burqa to reveal a shy smile."" I hope there's a woman out there in Afghanistan charging for these shots; she could make more than the Feminist Majority. Using the swatches makes gimmicks of Afghan women. They are too reminiscent of the array of ribbons on sale for various diseases -- pink ribbons for breast cancer, red ribbons for AIDS, etc. Also, they beg the question: Where are the swatches that represent the oppression of other women? It smacks of hypocrisy when we highlight the plight of women only when those imposing that plight are our enemies. I implore the Feminist Majority, first lady Laura Bush and Britain's Cherie Blair to read the State Department's annual reports on human rights. There is a report published for just about every country with a section on women's rights, and very few of them make for pleasant reading. So let's hear it for those women's rights too. I am a Muslim woman who does not wear a head scarf, chador or any kind of ""headgear"" -- the phrase used by a man who saw me on television recently and wrote to tell me I didn't ""look like a Muslim."" Although I would never wear a burqa and am frightened by its erasure of identity, I must agree with Afghanistan's new minister for women's affairs, who told the New York Times Magazine recently that it was not about the burqa but about choice. I have met women who choose to cover their entire body, including their face. We must support that choice. What kind of freedom do we claim to uphold if it is only the freedom to choose what we choose? Isn't that what it's about for women all over the world, be it the choice to vote, have an abortion, drive a car, wear a miniskirt or wear a scarf? When it becomes about what women wear rather than what they choose to wear then we infantilize women as much as the Taliban did. This is what happens when women cannot choose: In Saudi Arabia, women must cover in public. Taking a plane to that country is an exquisite exercise in social deception. Many of the women who board with you in the latest ""Western"" fashions head to the restroom before landing and emerge as black-robed shadows of their former selves. The reverse happens on flights out of Saudi Arabia. In Turkey, women cannot wear a head scarf in government buildings or on state university campuses. Women students who wish to wear a head scarf circumvent this ban by wearing wigs onto campus. It is time to move beyond the issue of dress and add depth to discussions of Muslim women. Among Muslim women themselves there is much vibrant debate. One need only reach for the work of Moroccan sociologist Fatima Mernissi, Harvard scholar Leila Ahmed and Amina Wadud of Virginia Commonwealth University, who among them cover everything from the veil to the reinterpretation of Islamic teaching. Their work wrestles Islam free of the bind of tradition that in too many countries passes for religion. These scholars have given me hope by challenging the dominance of male-dominated interpretations that many Muslims have long complained ignore the egalitarian spirit of Islam. To give Muslim girls and women everywhere hope, I would tell them of the day Ms. Wadud delivered the pre-sermon at Friday prayers at a South African mosque. That image of a woman addressing worshipers with her vast knowledge of their faith is worth a million burqa swatches.

"317","'Apartheid' in Saudi Arabia","MENA","Re: ""Saudi Arabia's Apartheid (Cont'd)"" by Colbert King [op-ed, Jan. 19]: Khalid Fahd Al-Faisal claimed that unaccompanied single females are permitted in the family section of his McDonald's restaurants in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This will come as a surprise to his employees, who evicted me at least three times from McDonald's expressly because I was an unaccompanied female. This was by no means a rare occurrence at McDonald's, which, according to its cowed employees, was frequently raided by the religious police on the lookout for unaccompanied female customers. The Starbucks I tried to patronize in Riyadh last spring had a family section that was one-third the size of the men's section and had no chairs or tables. When I asked about this, the employee behind the counter told my husband to tell me -- I was apparently invisible to him -- that I was expected to drink my coffee while sitting in our car. Experiences such as these are a common topic of discussion among women in Riyadh. The attempts by huffy Saudi males to describe what it is like to be a woman in Saudi Arabia are ludicrous. They have nothing useful to say about the experience of being an American woman (or any woman) who is refused service at an American restaurant simply because of her sex. Princeton, N.J. Colbert King's description of the McDonald's in Saudi Arabia was off base. Several years ago, as another professor and I prepared to conduct management development training for McDonald's managers, we visited each of the seven McDonald's restaurants in eastern Saudi Arabia. Contrary to what Mr. King said, the ""family"" sections (typically the whole upper floor of the building, which are set aside for families and unaccompanied single females) are much more attractive and better appointed than the smaller ""males only"" sections. The seating also is far superior to any McDonald's booths in the United States; there are even shutters that enable female occupants to remove their head coverings so they can eat in private. As far as McDonald's ""plead[ing] that they had no choice but to defer to the local 'culture,' "" I would ask: How would you operate a restaurant in Riyadh if you didn't provide separate eating areas? The answer is clear -- you wouldn't have any family or female customers. And because families spend the most money, you'd soon be out of business. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

"318","Keeping the Peace","MENA","When, in 1996, a motley collection of religious fanatics set out to not only subdue Afghanistan but destroy it, they knew that they had to give careful thought to the role of women. Unlike many mainstream political leaders and corporate titans, the Taliban -- ironically -- knew that they couldn't afford to devote to women only token, minimal planning. So they obsessed about women. Studied them. Accorded women more importance than did Afghan women themselves, many of whom dismissed the preposterous idea that a band of violent outsiders would, in short order, bar them from schools and workplaces, and banish them to their homes. political leaders and corporate titans, the Taliban -- ironically -- knew that they couldn't afford to devote to women only token, minimal planning. So they obsessed about women. Drew up an elaborate list of prescribed behaviors and then ceaselessly refined that list. Accorded women more importance than did Afghan women themselves, many of whom initially dismissed the preposterous idea that a band of violent outsiders would, in short order, bar them from schools and workplaces, and banish them to their homes. After all, why bother? Why did the Taliban make such a point of closeting women, sealing them off, clothing them head to toe in burqas? The mullahs claimed they did so for women's own protection. Many observers posited that they did so out of a fear of female sexual power. To me, it seems likely the reason was more pragmatic -- that the Taliban feared women not as sexual beings but as social ones; that they understood, with lunatic clarity, the complex ways that women contribute to social stability and, with it, to peace and order. They understood that when women can no longer teach -- 70 percent of Afghan schoolteachers were women, until the Taliban fired them -- and all female students are sent home, the boys who remain are likely to grow up ill-taught and credulous. They knew that when women are denied work -- even when their husbands have been conscripted or killed -- their children will be driven to beg or labor, depriving the country of a generation of young people who have developed normally into maturity and strength. They understood that when women are required to see only women doctors, and when there is a shortage of women doctors because only a few women doctors have been permitted to keep practicing, and when, as a result, sick women are sent home from the hospital, then illness and infection will flourish, tubercular women will spread TB in their homes, babies will die. In short, what the Taliban understood -- what they proved beyond doubt -- is that if you want to throw a society into chaos in order to better control it, a remarkably effective way to achieve this is not just to subjugate the women but to subtract them. Does it follow that giving women back their place gives a society back its order? Does it follow that by adding women to workplaces and government councils, a society can find its way out of warfare and back to peace? This is the unanswered question as the world looks toward the re-integration of women into Afghan life, a mission that remains elusive. When tribal leaders convened late last year to devise an interim government, it was only after pressure from Western organizers and Afghan women that they admitted even a handful of female delegates. The problem is not confined to Afghanistan. Around the world, regional peace-building councils have stubbornly resisted the inclusion of women, thanks to the misogyny that reigns (come to think of it) in most parts of the world where cyclical violence is rooted. So in recent years a strain of thought in public policy circles has developed to overcome this. While some in the field argue that women are natural peacemakers thanks to their loving maternal nature (at which point you are a short step away from the mullah-like argument that women are beings of a higher moral order, pure creatures best kept, really, off the street), there is a less simplistic argument that is more persuasive. This thinking holds that in order to restore peace to a region -- or to stave off war before it happens -- it's necessary to think about women as carefully as the Taliban did. That is to say, it's necessary to understand that the role of women in a society tends to be a crucial marker of its well- being. If women are being, say, sexually trafficked, this suggests a level of poverty and instability that could lead to out-and-out warfare. When attempting to rebuild a society after war, it's necessary to understand the specific functions of women in that society, necessary, when teaching ""land mine awareness,"" to convene a meeting at a time when women aren't away fetching firewood. Necessary to de-mine not only the roads and factories, but the fields and schools. Taking details like these into account may not ensure peace, but it will make peace more feasible. And who is more likely to take these details into account? ""Women,"" says Jennifer Klot, a senior adviser at UNIFEM, a United Nations office that aims, among other things, to place women at peacemaking tables. Women are essential to peace because, even when denied political power, they are essential to civil society. They are essential to the restoration of peace because they, better than anyone else, understand their own roles and vulnerabilities. Well, okay, the Taliban understood these, too. They understood, those great levelers, that when you subtract 50 percent of a country's population, what you get is 100 percent destruction.

Under tight, heavily armed security at the Ministry of Women's Affairs, the Americans met to discuss women's rights, education and business opportunities and, in the words of former White House counselor Karen P. Hughes, ""provide some small sense of encouragement to the women of Afghanistan."" Hughes, who left her job in April but still advises President Bush, was part of the group visiting Kabul under the auspices of the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council, founded last year with the encouragement of Bush and Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai. The delegation is being led by Paula J. Dobriansky, the undersecretary of state for global affairs. Though the issues that were discussed and the plans that were made wouldn't be considered controversial almost anywhere else in the world, they are in Kabul. When Afghanistan was ruled by the Taliban Islamic movement, from 1996 through 2001, women generally were not allowed to work, go to school or even leave their homes unless fully covered in the head-to-toe veil called a burqa. Though the Taliban's rigid interpretation of Islam was extreme by Afghan standards, deep-rooted traditions continue to impose restrictions on women and girls, who make up an estimated 60 percent of the country's population after decades of war. More than a year after the Taliban fled Kabul under attack by Afghan rebels and U.S. air power, most women on the streets of the capital still wear burqas. In many sections of the country, few women are seen outdoors. At a news conference in front of the women's ministry, Hughes said she was ""a little surprised to see so many women still in burqas. . . . I hope it is a choice and not out of fear, but I think we heard in the meeting that there is still a substantial amount of fear."" Hughes said Bush encouraged her to come ""as a symbol of his personal commitment to the people of Afghanistan."" The new American assistance will include a $ 2.5 million grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development to open women's centers in 14 provinces to offer help with literacy, health, education and starting small businesses. Soraya Rahim Sobhrang, deputy director of the women's ministry, said her office hoped the centers eventually could help with legal and family planning needs as well. Dobriansky said another $ 1 million will go to relief groups for programs related to the issues discussed at the meeting. In addition, DaimlerChrysler AG and AOL Time Warner Inc. have given money to help Afghan women's projects. In a reminder of how controversial women's issues can still be in Afghanistan, a group of female government officials and judges who visited the United States last fall came under harsh criticism at home after they were seen on television without head scarves meeting Bush. Islamic parties condemned the women for being ""immodest"" and bringing ""dishonor"" to Afghanistan. One of the women -- Marzia Basel, a judge in Kabul -- said she was afraid to return to her office because of the backlash, and soon after her return, she gave up her job. That trip to the United States was also organized under the auspices of the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council. Despite the continuing resistance by some Afghans, Foreign Minister Abdullah said the Karzai government was committed to promoting women's rights and issues. He said the fact that the U.S.-Afghan women's meeting could be held in Kabul represented ""one of the major turnarounds in the history of mankind.""",2003,"Afghanistan"
"320","For Afghan Women, Supreme Injustices","MENA","In his Jan. 6 op-ed column, ""Afghanistan's Milestone,"" Zalmay Khalilzad noted the role of women in the constitutional process in Afghanistan. The new constitution  articulates the equal rights of men and women before the law, but reality  and vision diverge. The courts in Afghanistan will be instrumental in determining whether the constitutional provision on equality is enforced. Yet the chief justice of the supreme court,  Sheik Hadi Shinwari, appointed by President Hamid Karzai, has restored many of the Taliban measures of gender oppression.  Afghan women are in jail for the ""crime"" of running away from home to escape sexual abuse or forced marriage, according to a lawyers association for Afghan women. Legal measures passed or upheld by President Karzai's administration ban married women from high school classes, restrict women's travel without  the company of a male guardian and prohibit women from singing in public. The constitutional provision on equality requires the elimination of these and many other legal provisions, provisions that the country's chief justice has been instrumental in creating, upholding and defending. Unless a new chief justice is appointed, the new  constitution will be no more than a symbolic victory for women. President Equality Now New York",2004,"Afghanistan"
"321","Women In the New Iraq","MENA","My second trip to Iraq since the liberation of Baghdad grabbed some headlines because of a rocket attack on our hotel. But a visit to a new women's center in the city of Hillah said more about Iraq's future than did that act of violence. A predominantly Shiite town known as the site of one of Iraq's largest mass graves, where as many as 15,000 may have been killed, Hillah is also the location of something very hopeful, the Al Hillah Women's Center -- a center to advance the cause of women's rights. The women I met with were proud of their center. One young woman wearing a conservative Muslim head covering pressed me forcefully about what the United States was doing to support women's rights. In return, I asked if she saw any contradiction between her conservative dress and her advocacy of women's rights. With evident conviction, she said, ""There is no inconsistency between my practice of my religion and human rights and rights for women."" In such words we find the hope of a new Iraq. And in people like Rajaa Khuzai, a 57-year-old mother of seven and one of three women on the Iraq Governing Council. In 1991, when Saddam Hussein sent Republican Guards to put down a rebellion in her town of Diwaniya, Khuzai was the only doctor left functioning in her hospital. An obstetrician, she remembers performing more than 20 Caesareans working alone by candlelight. Today Khuzai remains undaunted by the challenges of helping give birth to freedom in a country that was abused for more than three decades by a regime of murderers and torturers. A few weeks ago a delegation of Iraqi women, led by Khuzai, visited the Pentagon -- there were doctors, engineers and teachers, Sunnis, Shiites and Chaldean/Assyrians, Arabs, Turkmen and Kurds. Khuzai has described her group as symbolic of the new ""one-nation"" Iraq. Some spoke about problems, others about the progress already made. What they had in common is that they are all working for a free and peaceful Iraq where they will have an equal voice. The delegation told us that if Iraq is to become a democracy, women must have an equal role and more women should be included in Iraqi governing bodies and ministries. They pointed out that only three of the 25 members of the Iraqi Governing Council are women. They expressed the need to have women more directly involved in drafting the Iraqi constitution. They are concerned that if women are not involved, women will not be guaranteed equality under the law. They wanted Americans to know that Iraqis are grateful to be liberated from Hussein. And they also pointed out that we are now engaged with Iraqis in seeking a far greater prize: a chance for lasting change in the region that will help make our country and the world safer. History offers many examples of democratic principles at work in nations once dismissed by skeptics as unfit for democracy. Representative government, once thought impossible in Eastern Europe, is taking hold, though slowly in some places. In a country where only a few years ago women were brutalized and shunted from public view, Afghans recently adopted a constitution that establishes equal rights for men and women. Democracy, they once said, was impossible in most of East Asia. Only 20 years ago, when I became assistant secretary of state for East Asia, people said that Koreans had no experience of democracy and would be incapable of it. Or that the Philippines could never do better than the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. The Confucian culture of East Asia was said to be antithetical to democracy. Yet, in the past 20 years, not only South Korea and the Philippines but Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia have joined the democratic ranks. While each of these Asian democracies still faces challenges, each has made substantial progress. In the end, it will be up to Iraqis to fashion a democracy that suits their circumstances. One of the critical tests of an Iraqi democracy will be whether it empowers women to enjoy the benefits of freedom and prosperity without sacrificing their religious faith. This is an issue that concerns everyone, not only women. A government that does not respect the rights of half its citizens cannot be trusted to safeguard the rights of any. For that reason, the United States is giving special emphasis to helping Iraqi women achieve greater equality and has allocated $27 million for women's programs. Education for women is one of the highest priorities, and the United States has committed more than $86.8 million to education projects, with special emphasis on ensuring that girls are registered and attending school. Another effort is focused on legal reform. Substantial funding is also going to help women's groups throughout the country, including the center in Hillah. There are now 10 women's centers throughout the country and eight more are in the works. And with U.S. support, Iraqi women are being trained for the first time to serve as police officers, prison guards and security officers. These efforts are strongly supported by the legislative branch. Reps. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) and Tom Osborne (R-Neb.), who recently visited Iraq, have begun to organize a congressional caucus for Iraqi women to maintain effort and focus in this critical area. And these efforts are strongly supported by President Bush, who has said our aim is ""a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman."" It was clear that day in Hillah that the women were eager to be full participants in Iraq's democratic process. I gave them this challenge: I said that some people in this world say that Arabs can't build democracy. As I looked at the brave people of Hillah, men and women who'd already begun to find their voice, I added that I believe that is nonsense. ""You have a chance,"" I said, ""to prove them wrong. So please do it."" And we should do everything we can to help them. The writer is deputy secretary of defense.",2004,"Iraq"
"322","Truth, Lies and Women's Rights in Iraq","MENA","Charles Krauthammer [op-ed, Jan. 30] says ""people forget that when the Bush administration came into office, Iraq was a very unstable place."" He is offering this up as a latter-day justification for the war. After thousands of   Iraqis and more than 500 Americans have died, Iraq is much more unstable now than when President Bush came into office. It will probably remain an unstable place for years. There are now reports of al Qaeda in Iraq, whereas no credible evidence of al Qaeda activity in Iraq existed before the war. And although it has been proposed that fighting al Qaeda in Iraq means we don't have to fight it here in the United States, that is a false dichotomy -- which is hardly fair to the Iraqi people, who did not attack us nor ask us for our assistance. -- Susan Oehler Asheville, N.C. In his Feb. 1 op-ed piece, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz wrote that the ""United States is giving special emphasis to helping Iraqi women achieve greater equality."" But the U.S.-created Iraqi Governing Council recently passed Resolution 137, which would eliminate many of the basic rights that Iraqi women have by placing certain laws under the jurisdiction of Islamic law or sharia. Women's rights are in jeopardy and may be at greater risk once the transition to Iraqi sovereignty is complete. More than 40 members of the House have signed a letter to President Bush, written  by myself and Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.) and Darlene Hooley (D-Ore.), requesting that he reject this resolution and make women's equality a priority. Although I applaud the Bush administration for funding women's centers and education projects, these efforts will be useless unless the women of Iraq are treated equally with men. It would be a shame if our intervention in Iraq resulted in a giant step backward for Iraqi women, who historically had been integrated into Iraqi society. The Pentagon is being unrealistic if it believes that enough is being done to protect the rights of Iraqi women. It should have better intelligence about what is really going on in Iraq. -- Carolyn B. Maloney Washington The writer is a Democratic representative from New York. In discussing the Iraq intelligence fiasco, it is a bit too offhand for your paper to say in passing that the president conveyed this misinformation to us ""sometimes in exaggerated terms"" [editorial, Jan. 29]. Words count, and never more than now. If President Bush exaggerated, he did so because he did not think that the intelligence already amassed was convincing. And if he chose to overstate, it was with a calculated objective: to seduce us into accepting the ""grave and gathering"" peril in which we assuredly stood, despite the softness of the evidence. I do not purport to know why he fudged, but, for now, I do not need to know. What he owed us was the truth; exaggeration violated his oath. Bill Clinton was nearly removed from office because he lied about his dalliance with an intern. I do not recall that Clinton's recklessness with the truth put in jeopardy the lives of our armed forces and the strength of our economy. So may I suggest that when you refer to Bush's exaggerations in this debacle, you treat them with the solemnity they deserve. -- Bernard Ries Washington",2004,"Iraq"
"323","Building Careers, Despite the Barriers","MENA","March was Women's History Month. How timely that March was also when London-based, Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid was declared the winner of the 2004 Pritzker Prize, considered by many architects to be the most prestigious -- and its $100,000 award the most remunerative -- international recognition an architect can receive for design. The Washington Post article announcing the prize, written by Post architecture critic Benjamin Forgey, carried a headline proclaiming ""Hadid Is First Woman to Win Pritzker Prize."" Note that the headline delivered two distinct messages: it named the winner of the Pritzker, but emphasized that the winner is a woman. At the beginning of the article, Forgey reported that the Pritzker jury called Hadid's career ""a heroic struggle as she rose to the highest ranks of the profession."" He further commented that the prize ""focuses attention on the increasing stature of women in a traditionally male-dominated profession."" But the bulk of the story was about the defining aesthetic characteristics of her work and nature of specific projects. Nevertheless, I kept thinking about the other part of the story -- the struggle of women in architecture and the real challenges they face, today and in the past. In the 1960s, when I studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there was one woman in my class. The 40 Peace Corps volunteer architects in my group headed for Tunisia were all men. Before the 1970s, few women pursued careers in architecture. Women were scarce in architecture offices and even scarcer on school faculties. I knew of only one woman in Washington with her own firm: Chloethiel Woodard Smith. Women were not encouraged to practice architecture. Worse still, they were sometimes actively discouraged by parents, spouses, teachers, professors and architects. There were lots of reasons: the education is too long and arduous; the work is too technical; the profession is too competitive and risky. What were the chances that a woman had both the stamina and the requisite engineering and aesthetic talent? The subtle cultural signals were that women -- the gentle sex, the nurturers, the gathers and not the hunters -- were psychologically and physically unsuited to be architects. It was a testosterone thing. How could a woman be expected to venture onto a construction site with all those male workers uttering profanities, whistling, making disrespectful remarks and, worst of all, refusing to accept guidance or instructions from a woman? Why would a woman want to run around in the mud, climb ladders, argue with superintendents or wear hard hats? Then there is the family thing. How on earth could a woman be a fully engaged, responsible architect, working sometimes 50 or 60 hours a week, while also caring for a husband, bearing and raising children, keeping house and cooking meals for family and friends? Such were the arguments against women going into architecture. Fortunately, things have changed, but not everything. In architecture schools today, there are as many female students as males. Architecture offices are now filled with women, and the owners or partners of many firms are women. Increasing numbers of women teach architecture, although faculties are still mostly male. In the United States, women increasingly hold national, state and local leadership positions in the American Institute of Architects and routinely receive professional recognition in the form of design awards or election to the AIA College of Fellows. As in many careers, one challenge remains, always faced by women and unique to women: balancing professional and maternal motivations. After finishing architecture school and working for a number of years, women can feel torn between the demands of practice and the desire to have children. Even with all the tools and tactics now available to ease the burden of managing a household, including sharing household tasks with a partner, only a woman can become pregnant, give birth and nurse infants. Consequently, many female architects with families find themselves in middle age, no longer worrying about child care, but professionally not where they would have been had they not interrupted or slowed down their careers to bear and raise children. Reestablishing a full-time career at age 40 or 45 is an uphill battle for anyone, male or female. Some female architects avoid the career-vs.-family challenge by opting out of marriage and motherhood, just as some men are married wholly to their work. It can be a very difficult choice, yet it's clearly a choice that can reduce some sources of stress while enhancing professional potential. This is all the more reason to especially admire those professional women who have succeeded in being dedicated architects, wives and mothers simultaneously. They may not all win the Pritzker Prize, but they deserve recognition nonetheless. Roger K. Lewis is a practicing architect and a professor of architecture at the University of Maryland.",2004,"Iraq"
"324","Plenty of Soccer, but No Soccer Moms","MENA","Even for a panel discussion here at the Jeddah Economic Forum on the role of women in Saudi Arabia, the sexes were separated by a high barrier and women had to enter the room through what was called the ""Female Entrance."" The women -- most of them highly educated and generally affluent -- wore black abayas and, when they asked a question from the floor, they were not shown on the meeting hall's closed-circuit TV. At moments like this, I heard Dorothy's words to Toto in ""The Wizard of Oz"": ""I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."" Some of the discussion was about driving. This is something women cannot do in Saudi Arabia. The custom -- now a law -- imposes quite a burden on the society, not to mention individual women. Every working woman needs a driver. As more and more women work outside the home, more drivers are needed. The custom has few defenders among progressive Saudis, but the rest of society may be a different question. One of the male panelists -- someone who favored giving women the right to drive -- wondered if putting women behind the wheel would set off riots. A discussion ensued. After a while it was possible to forget that driving was under discussion -- not say, divorce or (gasp!) the end of polygamy, or even women's suffrage. Women behind the wheel. Soccer moms with kids in the back of the SUV. Not here, though. Plenty of soccer, but no soccer moms. When coming to Saudi Arabia from the United States, you need to set your watch. Officially, the time difference is eight hours ahead of the East Coast. Unofficially, I think it's about 250 years behind. Much of this feeling has to do with the obvious status of women. To the highly successful women (and men) brought here by the Council on Foreign Relations, it is a repellent, mysterious, puzzling and in-your-face aspect of a society that is so at odds with not just the West, but even the rest of the Arab world. I once had dinner at the home of a poor Egyptian in Cairo who hid his wife and daughter from me. They stayed in the kitchen and every once in a while an arm would emerge from behind a curtain and offer us more food. But even in Egypt, a somewhat conservative Muslim society, women drive. Saudi Arabia is a place unto itself. Saudi Arabia produces a good deal of the world's oil. But its most obvious product has to be cultural contradictions. I went to visit a firm called Al-Daleel Information Systems. Its president is Amr Mohamed Al Faisal, an architect and, almost incidentally, the grandson of the former King Faisal. The firm does a variety of whiz-bang things having to do with data storage and computer mapping and, of course, architecture. An employee showed me a handheld device which showed a map of downtown Jeddah. You could zoom in and zoom out and find your way anywhere. But you could not find your way around this contradiction: the employee was a woman. She was draped in black and worked in a room reserved for women. The women prefer this arrangement, I was told. This way, they don't have to remain fully covered. Somewhere -- off-stage and out of sight -- are the religious authorities. They have their own police, ready to pounce on any inappropriately dressed woman. Their power is so great that they have managed to stop time. It is the religious authorities who will not permit women to drive or vote, and insist that they dress in non-Gucci black. Back in 1990, some 50 women took to their cars in protest. The religious authorities reacted with alarm. Once women drove cars, who knew what would follow? To the religious, this was a clear moral issue with grave sexual overtones. The women were punished, their families suffered and a sexist custom was codified into law. How long can this continue? Maybe as long as oil prices remain high and the kingdom can afford a sexist version of the racial segregation Americans once practiced. In the end, though, economics and common sense will trump religious zealotry and women will be liberated. Some women here think it will take two more generations. They should know. But sometimes an outsider has a keener eye for absurdities -- not to mention the satellite dishes on almost every roof that download what women all over the world are doing. Not yet, but soon . . .

"325","Women of Islam","MENA","THEY MET THE new secretary of state, spoke to women's organizations and conferred with the U.S. Agency for International Development.  But the delegations of Afghan and Iraqi women  --  led by Massouda Jalal, Afghanistan's minister of women's affairs, and Narmin Othman, her counterpart in Iraq  -- were not in Washington last week merely to make courtesy calls. They were here to stress that women's issues, in the new democracies of Iraq and Afghanistan, are not peripheral. How these two countries resolve them may determine whether they remain democratic societies, or even open societies. In Iraq, this question will surface soon, during debate over the new Iraqi constitution. The issue is central to all Iraqis: What Westerners think of as fundamental rights for women  --  to own money and property and to work outside the house  --  can be established only if the constitution guarantees all Iraqis the right to religious freedom. But if the constitution establishes an extreme form of sharia law, either directly or by implication, then clerics will be able to set the rules not only for women but eventually for everyone, men and women, in Iraq's Christian, Kurdish and secular communities. Any clause or formula that enables unelected clerics to veto laws passed by the elected legislature will, over time, erode whatever fragile democracy is in place at the time the constitution takes effect. This is not to say that either Iraq or Afghanistan should look like the West or that they should accept an American notion of separation of church and state. But outsiders should pay attention to at least two fundamental issues. One is a guarantee for women to have a role in the political process: the rights to vote and stand for office. The second is that elected politicians, not clerics, should have ultimate jurisdiction over the legal system. If those two elements are in place, then Iraqi society will be able to evolve, as have other Islamic societies such as Morocco. That will not only protect the rights of women who do not want to live according to the most fundamentalist interpretations of Islam but also ensure that Iraq does not become a static theocracy. The United States cannot dictate outcomes, but the view that American politicians, legal advisers, aid workers and others take of these issues can continue to influence the debate in Iraq, as in Afghanistan. It is in U.S. interests, as well as Iraq's interests, for Americans at the highest levels to continue to push hard on those issues and not assume that they can be dealt with later.",2005,"Iraq"
"326","First Lady Lobbies for Women's Rights in Mideast","MENA","First lady Laura Bush on Saturday challenged a region dominated by men and traditional values to allow women into the political process and workplace, saying equal rights were essential for democratic progress in the Middle East. The first lady, making a high-profile speech at the World Economic Forum in Jordan's seaside district of Southern Shuneh, said new freedoms granted to the women of Afghanistan, Iraq, Kuwait and Morocco had proved equal rights were compatible with Islam and Arab culture. ""Women who have not yet won these rights are watching,"" Bush said at the King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center on the banks of the Dead Sea. ""Freedom, especially freedom for women, is more than the absence of oppression. It's the right to speak and vote and worship freely. Human rights require the rights of women. And human rights are empty promises without human liberty."" Bush was making her maiden trip as first lady to the Middle East, starting with a speech that drew a polite, though unenthusiastic, response, as well as private meetings with Jordan's King Abdullah, Queen Rania and Jordanian youths. Later, she toured Jordan's Mount Nebo, where the Bible says God led Moses to see the promised land across the Jordan River. On a hot, dry day, the first lady stood atop the mountain to survey the Dead Sea and the dusty valley below. The haze clouded what otherwise is a majestic view of Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah and Jericho from the mountain's peak. ""It's a beautiful place to come,"" she said to reporters. The first lady later held a lunchtime discussion with six Jordanian women at Haret Jdoudna, considered the finest restaurant in Madaba, a small Christian community not far from Nebo. Bush, on a diplomatic mission to try to improve the United States' image in the Arab world, told leaders gathered for the forum that education and women's rights were two pillars of a vibrant democracy. In a 20-minute speech, the first lady said world leaders must allow students  --  both male and female  --  to study freely in educational institutions. ""As freedom becomes a fact of life for rising generations in the Middle East, young people need to grow up with a full understanding of freedom's rights and responsibilities: the right to discuss any issue in the public sphere, and the responsibility to respect other people and their opinions,"" she said. She was scheduled to visit a school with Queen Rania on Sunday. Local critics have said the White House should be providing more financial aid to the region to promote education and business opportunities. Much of the Arab world is expanding women's rights. Kuwait's parliament this month granted women the right to vote and to run in national and local elections. About 40 percent of the 8 million Afghans who voted for president in October were women, while Iraqi women went to the polls for the first time in January. In Morocco, women fought successfully to change the century-old family code that gave men more legal rights than women. ""Americans are inspired by the courage and determination of women throughout the Middle East,"" Bush said. ""We want to be partners in helping them move forward."" A report released Friday by Freedom House, a nonpartisan U.S.-based group that monitors worldwide political rights, detailed the institutional and social obstacles facing women throughout the Arab world. The study, based on interviews with men and women throughout the region, found that discriminatory laws and social mores have created a massive gender gap not unlike the one the United States faced until well into the 20th century. All 16 countries and one territory studied, except Saudi Arabia, call for equal rights in their constitutions, but few offer them in practice, the report found. Women receive inferior education, are sometimes subject to harsher criminal penalties than men and face discrimination in nationality and citizenship laws. However, it is family law that many experts consider the biggest impediment to women's progress. In much of the Arab world, husbands can restrict their wives' freedom to travel and to work and can divorce them without reason. Saudi Arabia, which does not allow women to vote, received the lowest grade possible from Freedom House. ""The lack of women's rights must be regarded as a chief obstacle to democratic reform,"" the group's executive director, Jennifer Windsor, said in a statement. Still, Bush said the Middle East was experiencing a ""a springtime of hope"" in which ""brave men and women are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government."" She praised the people of Lebanon and Kuwait in particular for demanding change. ""We believe the world is witnessing a new era of expanding liberty,"" she said, adding that ""the pace of this improvement will vary from country to country."" The Middle East, democratic reforms and the war on terror  --  three issues at the center of U.S. foreign policy  --  will be front and center at the White House this week. President Bush will meet Monday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to discuss the state of the newly minted government at a time when riots and killings there are threatening U.S. objectives. ""A nation that once knew only the terror of the Taliban is now seeing a rebirth of freedom, and we will help them succeed,"" President Bush said in a radio address Saturday. This Thursday, three days after the first lady's visit to Israel, Bush will host Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, at the White House to discuss the troubled peace process. Recent violence in the Gaza Strip is underscoring the tenuous nature of both the truce and broader efforts to create an independent Palestinian state. The president will conclude his week by talking about the war on terror and efforts to revamp the military at a commencement address at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. Bush's plan to close military bases and relocate thousands of personnel has met stiff resistance in Congress, while Democrats say the president is not doing enough to guard the United States from terrorist attacks.",2005,"Jordan"
"327","Democracy Under The Veil","MENA","She looked nice, Laura Bush, in her black veil and modest dress, touring the Dome of the Rock, smiling sweetly at the protesters outside. She sounded nice, too, in her keynote speech at the Dead Sea in Jordan. She talked about education, called this a ""springtime of hope,"" spoke of translating books for the children of Lebanon and Bahrain. Here and there she also mentioned women, as in ""Americans are inspired by the courage and the determination of women throughout the Middle East,"" or ""our challenge is to help more women gain the confidence and the credit to start their own business."" As I say, it was a nice speech, and by all accounts it received polite applause. What it failed to do, however, was to place the extraordinarily touchy  --  and not very nice  --  issue of Islamic women's rights where it belongs: smack in the middle of the democracy debate going on in the Muslim world, and most of all in Iraq. Appearances to the contrary, legal equality for women in the Islamic world is not a peripheral cause, something it would be nice to have, like more Arabic translations of children's books. Nor should it be left for the first ladies to discuss while the diplomats and soldiers decide the important stuff. On the contrary, the decisions made about women's status may well determine whether democracy and the rule of law can be made to stick in that part of the world at all. To see what I mean, look at the Iraqi constitutional debate, now informally underway. Some of the politicians involved have in the past said they would like Iraq's laws governing divorce, marriage and women's property ownership to be written in strict conformance with sharia religious law. There are others who want the constitution itself to declare sharia ""the source"" rather than ""a source"" of Iraqi law, or to proclaim that ""no law can contradict Islam."" In practice, any of these formulations could eventually give unelected clerics the ability to override the law, since no secular parliament can define sharia. And once religious courts take precedence over elected officials, women will not be the only victims. In Iran, for example, the constitution does guarantee ""the rights of women."" But neither women's rights nor anyone else's rights can be enforced in Iran because clerics, not legislators, define ""rights"" for all Iranians. The role of women is also tangled up in still more basic issues: How much control should the state have over the behavior of an individual? How much religious freedom should Iraqis or other Muslims have, particularly given that there is more than one way to interpret the Koran? In a recent speech, Iranian writer Azar Nafisi compared her grandmother, who wore a veil all her life, with her mother, who considered herself a Muslim and went on pilgrimages to Mecca, yet never wore a veil. Who, she asked, is in a position to say which woman was the ""good"" Muslim? ""No government, no state has the right to interfere with the way an individual woman or man worships or does not worship his or her God."" And any political system that does not limit the state's ability to dictate the behavior and beliefs of its citizens, male or female, is at risk of backsliding into totalitarianism, no matter how often its citizens go to the voting booths. None of which is to say that Iraq, Iran or any other Muslim country should look like the United States, or that Muslim women should look like Western women, or that any Muslim country needs to implement an American-style separation of church and state. But Islamic constitutions vary, from the Turkish to the Moroccan to the Egyptian, and many do give women basic rights. At the very least, religious and political freedom must be guaranteed for women if Iraq is to remain a democracy, or even an open society, over time. We should use whatever limited influence we have to convince the Iraqis of this case. It was nice that the first lady chose to devote a major chunk of a major speech to the women of Islam. But it would make a bigger difference if her husband chose to do the same. applebaumanne@yahoo.com",2005,"Iraq"
"328","Women at War","MENA","THE HOUSE ARMED Services Committee is expected today to take up the emotional issue of women in combat. Given the large numbers of servicewomen risking their lives in Iraq, in a war with no front lines, this debate has a certain detachment from reality. President Bush has said that his position on the subject is clear  --  ""No women in combat""  --  but such an edict isn't simple to apply. Though theoretically banned from combat, women in today's military routinely find themselves in combat situations. As one female sergeant leading a search team that guards the gates of Baghdad's Green Zone told The Post's Ann Scott Tyson, ""If he said no women in combat, then why are there women here in Iraq?"" The narrow question before the committee is whether the Army, in reorganizing to create more flexible, deployable units that combine combat soldiers and support troops, is stealthily violating the ban on women in combat. Existing policy prohibits women from serving in units that are ""assigned a primary mission to engage in direct ground combat"" or that routinely operate alongside such units. Having women in such forward-support companies, some lawmakers argue, runs afoul of that second category. An amendment to the defense authorization bill  -- sponsored by committee Chairman Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) and approved by a subcommittee last week  --  would bar women  from serving in such companies. Proponents of the amendment argue that it would affect only a handful of women, but the Army staff director, Lt. Gen. James L. Campbell, estimated that it would close about 22,000 positions to female soldiers, and the Army considers that a conservative estimate. The Army may be stretching the limits of the no-combat rule. But the more critical question is whether it makes sense to exclude women from these forward-support positions. Even if the prohibition on women in combat still makes sense  --  which isn't clear to us  --  why apply that ban in a way that limits the military's flexibility  when its ranks are already stretched? Why, when the services are having trouble recruiting, tell women that their options will narrow as the Army modernizes? Since female  soldiers aren't being kept out of harm's way in any event, why not let them perform the jobs for which they trained? At a minimum, lawmakers ought to consider this issue thoughtfully, with hearings and informed debate. Instead, Mr. Hunter's amendment was sprung on the subcommittee last week in a last-minute surprise. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has been silent on the issue, but the Army's leadership vehemently opposes the amendment. Lawmakers should pause to understand why before acting precipitously.",2005,"Iraq"
"329","Saudi Women Rise in Defense of the Veil; Some Conservatives Fear U.S.-Led Erosion of Traditional Islamic Values","MENA","More than 500 women packed the Saudi capital's Maimouna Center on a recent evening to attend a lecture. The women, some still in their full black wraps, filled the rows of plum-colored plastic chairs, while late arrivals sat in small clusters on the carpet and against the wall. ""Whom do we love?"" asked the lecturer, a woman, seated behind a desk on a raised platform. ""God,"" the women answered in unison. ""Then we must obey Him."" She went on to urge the audience members to dress modestly and raise their daughters to do the same. She explained that, despite what some Saudis are now saying, it is a sin for men and women to mix. ""Even if people don't see you sin, God is watching,"" she warned. ""On Judgment Day, your own skin will testify against you."" As she took copious notes, Mashael al-Eissa dabbed at tears, overcome by the extent of her religious responsibilities. Eissa, a fiery young Internet writer, and the lecturer, Afrah al-Humaydi, are among a group of conservative Saudi women trying to redress what they view as an erosion of traditional values in the kingdom and a dangerous shift in the status of women. ""Saudi women are the luckiest in the world and Saudi Arabia is the closest thing to an ideal and pure Islamic nation,"" Eissa said. ""We don't want imported Western values to destroy that."" The changes that have so riled Eissa and other conservative women followed the intense scrutiny that Saudi Arabia received after the discovery that 15 of the 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States were Saudis. The lack of personal liberties in the kingdom  --  an absolute monarchy that imposes a strict form of Islam  --  was widely held to be an underlying part of the extremist ideology the attackers shared. Shortly afterward, strict censorship of the media was loosened and subjects that the religious establishment had placed off-limits for decades, such as the ban on women driving or working alongside men, were openly debated. Women, previously hidden, started appearing as television newscasters, and their photos became daily staples in the press. King Abdullah, crowned in August, called for increased work opportunities for women and started including female journalists, professors and business leaders on his trips overseas. And during regional tours last year, both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Undersecretary of State Karen Hughes said Saudi women needed broader political rights to make changes in their lives. But the new atmosphere has alarmed conservative women who are suspicious of U.S. interference and warn that changes in their status could destroy the country's Islamic framework. Though no figures are available, conservative, religious women seem to constitute a sizable portion of the country's female population, belying notions that most Saudi women are unhappy with their lot and waiting to be liberated. On the contrary, the black veil and the prohibition against women driving are embraced by many women here as a form of protection and an integral part of their religion. Faiza al-Obaidi, a biology professor, says she thinks the attempts at Western-style female emancipation are part of a religious war being waged by the United States, ""an intellectual rather than physical colonization."" Sitting at the food court at the Basateen Mall in the coastal city of Jiddah one weekend, lifting her veil to take bites from a tuna sandwich, she said the West was targeting women, the core of society, as a means of eventually controlling the whole country. ""They fear Islam, and we are the world's foremost Islamic nation,"" she said. Obaidi shows pride in her religion and resists foreign interference, she said, by maintaining her veil, or niqab. ""Just because this is closed,"" she said, tugging at the black material that covered her face, ""doesn't mean this is,"" pointing to her head. Samia Adham, a statistics professor seated beside her, also in a veil, added: ""This is a choice. We choose to be ruled by Islam. We will make changes, but within our religion and in our own way."" Two young men with long hair and wearing bright T-shirts and frayed jeans entered the food court and sat at a table with a young woman. Obaidi shook her head. ""You wouldn't have seen that several years ago,"" she said. Many Salafi women here, who follow the school of thought that calls for a return to Islam as practiced by the prophet Muhammad and the following two generations, shatter the stereotype of women in black niqab as meek and submissive. Often well educated, articulate and sometimes downright aggressive, they include award-winning scientists, writers and college professors. Khadija Badahdah, a university administrator who holds a doctorate in chemistry from the University of London and wears a veil, said she recently started to grant television interviews because women calling for change were dominating coverage on the airwaves and in newspapers and giving the wrong impression of Saudi women. ""They are a minority but they appear to speak for all of us,"" she said, sitting in her comfortable home in Jiddah on a recent weekend. ""This is the beginning of a cultural erosion, and if we don't fight it now, it will continue."" The Salafi women have also used lectures and Internet and newspaper campaigns to combat what they view as negative developments. Though they appear to be fighting against women's rights, they say they are actually fighting for the rights granted to women in Islam. Humaydi, the lecturer, says she counsels women to educate themselves for at least half an hour a day about their rights under Islamic law. The problems faced by Saudi women, she said, are not because of Islam, which she calls a perfect religion that honors and values women. The fault lies in its improper implementation. ""We were given rights by Islam 1,400 years ago that women in the West only got at the beginning of the 20th century,"" said Humaydi, a middle-aged college professor. ""Muslim women can work, and inherit, and be financially independent."" But working alongside men, taking leadership positions or removing the veil are choices that the religious women say are not open to them. This year a Gallup poll in eight predominantly Muslim countries found that only in Saudi Arabia did the majority of women not agree that women should be allowed to hold political office. Last summer, 500 women addressed a letter to Abdullah asking him to save the country from the onslaught of Westernized ideas regarding women and to maintain the ban on women driving and working with men. Men and women should not share work spaces, Humaydi contends, because Islam says not to place oneself in an environment where adultery can occur. ""People are wonderful, but the devil doesn't sit still,"" she said, adding that even Bill Clinton, while president, ""couldn't resist him."" At Jiddah's King Fahd Medical Research Center, a small Casio recorder played Koranic verses in the background as Faten Khorshid peered through a microscope, her niqab falling past her shoulders over her long white lab coat. Khorshid, who received a government grant for cancer research, says that her conservative views have not held her back and that the niqab makes it easier for doctors to concentrate on work instead of one another. ""I don't want to be the equal of a man,"" she added. ""In many ways, I am better than him.""",2006,"Saudi Arabia"
"330","In Brief","MENA","Muslim women should be allowed to vote, drive and work outside the home, but gender inequality is not a primary problem, a majority of Muslim women said in a new Gallup poll. The 2005 poll, released Tuesday, questioned 8,000 women about their perceptions of life in Muslim and Western countries. Women were polled in Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. A majority said women should be allowed to vote, ranging from 68 percent in Pakistan to 95 percent in Egypt. A majority also said women should be allowed to work at any job they are qualified for, serve in high levels of government and drive  unaccompanied. Most of these countries allow women to conduct these activities, said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. A vast majority of Muslim women surveyed most admired their society's adherence to Islamic values. Those sampled said lack of unity, extremism and political corruption were the main problems with their societies. Inequality between the sexes, criticized by many in the West, barely registered with Muslim women. No more than 2 percent of women in Egypt and Morocco said it was an issue. In the more-westernized countries of Lebanon and Turkey, 11 percent said gender inequality was a problem. The survey was conducted in the women's homes, in rural and urban areas, between August and October. --  Religion News Service The United Methodist Church is facing a showdown on gay-policy decisions in 2008, similar to those that the Episcopal Church and Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) will be dealing with in coming weeks. That is because the annual meeting of Minnesota Methodists approved several petitions to the denomination's next general conference that endorse openly gay clergy and same-sex marriage. The closest vote, 358 to 356, backed a proposal  to define marriage as between ""two adult persons"" rather than ""a man and a woman"" and cease supporting civil laws that require heterosexual definitions of marriage. A separate bill encouraged secular laws to ""ensure full civil and economic rights for persons in civil unions and marriages without regard to the gender of the partners."" Other measures would delete a Methodist rule that bars ""self-avowed practicing homosexual"" clergy and prohibits church blessings for homosexual unions, and would delete a policy statement that homosexual practice is incompatible with Christian teaching. Each quadrennial Methodist conference since 1972 has debated gay issues. --  Associated Press Research released Tuesday by Mission Aviation Fellowship analyzes 364 isolated areas whose inhabitants are considered the hardest to reach for evangelistic work and social services. Of the world's 20 ""least-reached"" ethnic groups, 15 were in Asia, including five each in Afghanistan (Hazara, Pashtun, Tajik, Turkman, Uzbek) and China (Han, Han-Gan, Kham, Salar, Tu) and two in Nepal (Magar, Rai). Other groups were located in Djibouti, Guinea, India, Iraq, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Pakistan. A broader index of the most difficult areas for Christian missionaries to reach showed 173 in Africa, 97 in Latin America and 94 in Asia. In all, two-thirds of the regions had little or no Christian ministry in place. The Operation Access report had been in preparation since 2000. It focuses on ""pockets of people who are either forgotten or unreached"" and on the problems that ""prevent or impede peoples' access to the Gospel,"" such as inaccessible locations, language barriers, economic factors, laws and religious opposition. It also lists any Christian agencies with contacts in each area. The Protestant fellowship provides 40,000 flights a year, as well as communications and other support for missionaries and nongovernment organizations in remote areas. It conducted the study to set its own plans for the next 15 to 20 years and help other evangelical groups with strategy. --  Religion News Service",2006,"Egypt"
"331","With Divorce Rate Rising, Saudis Are Turning to Courses on Married Life","MENA","Khulud Abdul-Aziz enrolled in a course on manners, fashion and cooking that prepares young women to be good wives because she does not want to end up another statistic in Saudi Arabia's rising divorce rate. ""I want to be qualified for marriage in every respect,"" said the 19-year-old university student who is getting married in a few months. The increasing divorce rate has alarmed many here, but some argue that Saudi men can be part of the problem, unable to deal with a female population that is more educated and assertive. The course Abdul-Aziz takes at al-Shaqaiq Society in the western seaport of Jiddah is just one of the ways social organizations are trying to help curb the number of divorces,  up 20 percent in recent years, according to government estimates. While courts and marriage officials register about 70,000 marriage contracts annually, they also process more than 13,000 official divorce papers, said the Planning Ministry, according to media reports. Fahad al-Yahya, a psychiatrist who counsels married couples, estimates that at least 30 percent of Saudi first marriages end in divorce. The rate is comparable to that in the United States, where, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, 33 percent of first marriages are disrupted either by separation or divorce. So alarming is the problem that Saudi newspapers often carry stories discussing the issue, citing examples of the trivial incidents that lead to some of the divorces. Newspapers reported that a man divorced his wife after he found out she had owned a camera phone for two years. Another left his wife because she insisted on waiting for a flight at the airport that kept getting delayed, rather than return home, as the husband had suggested. Experts say the rapid technological change the kingdom witnessed as a result of the 1970s oil boom is one of the major reasons for the rise in divorce rates. Oil money rapidly turned desert expanses into slick urban centers and gave a boost to women's education, introduced only in the 1960s. But this jump into the 21st century has not been accompanied by a parallel change in traditions and attitudes, such as views that wives should be meek and undemanding. Some men, experts say, don't know how to cope with educated women. ""The Saudi woman has joined the workforce and has become more educated,"" said al-Yahya. Stringent rules segregating the sexes have remained in place despite the modern facade that has brought malls, satellite television and the Internet into the kingdom. Boys and girls are separated once they reach puberty and are often not prepared to live with a member of the opposite sex after they get married. Women, who must wear veils and black cloaks called abayas, are kept away from men who are not husbands, brothers or uncles. Very rarely do couples go out before they get married, and some don't see their spouses until their wedding night. Even after they get married, it is difficult for couples to go out together. For instance, a married couple cannot go out to dinner with other married couples because the wives would be in the presence of men who are not their husbands. At family gatherings, women and men sit in separate rooms. The institution of marriage also has been rocked by the introduction of other forms of marriage, sometimes called weekend marriages, that have grown in popularity in Saudi Arabia after influential clergy issued edicts supporting them earlier this year. These marriages relieve men of financial responsibilities and other obligations, including having to reveal them to family or other wives. Islam allows men to have up to four wives. The proponents of such marriages say they decrease the number of unwed Saudi women, but critics say such unions destroy the family structure and encourage men to take additional wives who are usually younger ""ornaments"" rather than older unmarried women. ""I wonder if the virtuous men issuing such edicts do not pause to ponder the effects of such righteous proclamations on our fragile society,"" wrote Tariq al-Maeena in Arab News recently. Al-Yahya said one way to save marriages is to make divorce more difficult. In Islam, a man can dissolve a marriage just by telling his wife, ""You are divorced."" Women, meanwhile, must go to court to get their marriages dissolved and can do so only under exceptional circumstances such as the husband's mental illness. ""If there were strict laws, they would make men think twice before divorcing their wives,"" al-Yahya said. At a recent al-Shaqaiq Society class, Abdul-Aziz and 17 other young women sat at a horseshoe-shaped table to hear a lecture on ""Discovering the Treasures for a Happy Life."" The society offers similar courses for men. ""What do you want out of married life?"" instructor Almass al-Hijn asked the group. ""Is your goal to find someone to spoil you and take you out to restaurants or to find a man who will protect you and with whom you can build a family?"" One student, 19-year-old Sara Bawahhal, who recently got engaged, said she just hopes the course gives her the tools she needs to be a good wife. ""Girls don't know what is expected of them in marriage,"" she said. ""This course expands a girl's horizons so she can go into marriage with open eyes.""",2007,"Saudi Arabia"
"332","Saudi Women See a Brighter Road on Rights; Group Says King May Lift Driving Ban by Year's End","MENA","Buoyed by recent advances in women's rights, advocates for the right of women to drive in Saudi Arabia -- the only country in the world that prohibits female drivers -- say they believe the ban will be lifted this year. The women's group has collected more than 3,000 signatures in the past five months and hopes that King Abdullah will issue a royal decree giving women the right to drive. Since taking the throne in 2005, Abdullah has championed women's right to work and often takes official trips overseas with delegations of female journalists and academics. The king has said that he does not oppose allowing women to drive but that society needs to accept the idea first. ""I think the authorities want people to get used to the idea and will lift the ban before the end of the year,"" said Wajeha al-Huwaider, 45, an educational analyst and co-founder of the group. The group, which sent the king petitions in September and December asking him to lift the ban, is working on a third. ""Every time we gather 1,000 signatures, we will send them,"" Huwaider said. She and co-founder Fouzia al-Ayouni said they were encouraged by the recent easing of certain strictures on women and statements from senior officials saying the driving ban is more social than religious or political. In November, the foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, told Britain's Channel 4 news that there was no Saudi law prohibiting women from driving. ""Myself, I think they should drive,"" he said, but added: ""For us, it is not a political issue, it is a social issue. We believe that this is something for the families to decide, for the people to decide, and not to be forced by the government, either to drive or not to drive."" Saudi Arabia follows a strict form of Islamic law that does not allow women self-guardianship, mandating a male guardian for women of all ages. A woman cannot travel, appear in court, marry or work without permission from a male guardian, sometimes her own son. Until recently, women were also barred from checking into hotels and renting apartments unless they were with a male guardian. But a royal decree announced this month now allows women to stay in hotels and furnished apartments unaccompanied. The newspaper Al-Watan reported last week that a circular has been issued to hotels asking them to accept women who show identification. The hotel is then required to register the women's details with the police. But in this deeply religious and patriarchal society, many believe that allowing women the right to drive could lead to Western-style openness and an erosion of traditional values. Many women complain that driving is a necessity and argue that not everyone can afford to hire foreign drivers, whose salaries range from $300 to $600 a month, plus room and board. Live-in chauffeurs, often from the Philippines or the Indian subcontinent, are considered unlikely to develop relationships with the women. Several times a week, Haifa Osra, 31, one of the first members of the group, walks 10 minutes from her apartment to an Internet cafe to sort through the details of the women who have signed the latest petition. This week, she approached four women at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and asked them to add their names. Haifa Khashoggi, 48, a homemaker, agreed that women should be allowed to drive, ""but with conditions."" The other women concurred, saying that initially only women older than a certain age should drive, and not at all hours. ""It's safer and more Islamic for me to drive myself than to sit with an unrelated male driver,"" said Nadia Nusair, 45, a consultant on educational and family issues. ""It will be chaos at first,"" said Ibtisam al-Sharif, 47. ""But pretty soon, driving will be accepted and everyone will find it normal.""",2008,"Saudi Arabia"
"333","Afghan Law on Women Brings Societal Conflict Onto World Stage","MENA","Outside the gates of Kabul University, young Shiite women in fashionable black jackets and scarves hopped off city buses each morning last week, then strolled to biology and law classes alongside clusters of male students, chatting about career plans. But in a carpeted mosque a few blocks away, the Shiite imam admonished male worshipers Friday to keep close watch on their wives and daughters, saying it is ""Satan's work"" when women visit public places such as shrines wearing attractive clothing. Behind a curtain, female worshipers enveloped in burqas listened in silence. Like Afghan society at large, the country's Shiite Muslim minority is grappling with conflicting pressures between a strong tradition of male family dominance and a gradually evolving acceptance of women's modern rights. Usually, this struggle takes place out of the public eye, within families and religious communities. In the past few days, however, the legal repression of Afghan Shiite women has created a global uproar, bringing condemnation from Western governments and U.N. officials, just as Washington and NATO are debating their military and economic commitment to Afghanistan and the faltering war against Islamist insurgents. Critics charge that the new Shiite Personal Status Law, signed last week by President Hamid Karzai, would enshrine the rights of Shiite men to sexually enslave their wives and keep them imprisoned at home. Western leaders have compared the law to the Taliban era of 1996 to 2001, when Sunni extremists ruled Afghanistan and banned women from work and school. Karzai defended the law at a news conference Saturday, saying he had seen nothing in it that justified international concerns and suggesting that Western critics had misinterpreted the contents. However, he said he would have his justice minister review the law ""very carefully"" to make sure it does not contradict the Afghan constitution. ""I have studied the law. . . . What I saw did not reflect what has been said in the Western media,"" Karzai told reporters in his palace. Reading from one section, he said, ""a woman may leave home for legitimate purposes . . . it does not say she is not allowed to go out."" But the contretemps has raised questions about the government's commitment to women's rights, the degree to which Afghan society is capable of cultural and religious change, and whether the president is sacrificing democratic progress to court support from conservative Shiite leaders in order to run for reelection in August. Much like previous controversies over the legal prosecution of Afghans who converted to Christianity and questioned aspects of the Koran, the foreign furor over restrictive Shiite family law has highlighted a startling disconnect between this conservative Muslim society and its  supporters in the Western world. The controversy has also drawn attention to the diversity within the Afghan Shiite populace, a minority of mostly ethnic Hazaras that has long been looked down upon by majority Sunnis. Shiites live in some of the poorest rural areas, where female literacy is near zero, and in some of the most progressive urban districts, where girls and women participate in education and professions at a far higher rate than Sunnis. In interviews here over the past several days, Shiite men and women of all ages and backgrounds said it is their belief that men should rule over female family members. But while some said women need to be sheltered from danger and that men know what  is best for them, others said women's freedoms  are expanding naturally with the times. ""It is a man's right to tell the woman where to go and what to do. For us, this is normal; it is common sense,"" said Farishta, 21, a psychology student at Kabul University. ""In older times, the husband or father controlled 100 percent. Now, in more modern times, the control is about 20 percent. We go to college and courses. We respect our fathers and husbands completely, but it is only God who gives human beings freedom."" Syed Hussein Alemi Balkhi, a Shiite legislator who helped draft the new law, said it offers  Shiite women extensive freedoms and that it was needed because current Afghan family law follows Sunni Muslim guidelines. He asserted that the new law does not require wives to submit sexually to their husbands or seek their permission to leave home for culturally acceptable activities, including school, jobs, weddings, family visits and medical appointments. ""There needs to be a law for Shiism in Afghanistan, so that 20 percent of the population can solve their family problems according to their own law,"" Balkhi said, noting that the legislation was debated, revised and approved in parliament. ""I am amazed that no one is mentioning all the good things we provided for women in the law. If there are problems, we can solve them without foreign interference."" But foreign governments are not the only critics. Afghan human rights groups and female legislators fought for months to include such provisions in the law  as older minimum ages for marriage and more children's custody rights for divorced women. They said some Shiite leaders were using the need for a national minority ""identity"" as an excuse to legally impose regressive restrictions on women. Nader Nadery, a member of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, pointed out that Afghan prisons contain many women who were sent there for disobeying their husbands, and that in rural areas where people are less educated, a Shiite man may forbid his wife to visit a male doctor in the belief that it is culturally and religiously unacceptable. ""We are extremely concerned that this law would give a legal basis to the further victimization of women,"" Nadery said, adding that some liberal Shiite clerics and scholars had also raised objections. ""It seems to define women in sexual terms and to further narrow and suppress their role in family life. This is extremely disturbing.""",2009,"Afghanistan"
"334","Role of Women In Iran Protest Kindles Hope; Female Muslims Abroad Say They Draw Inspiration For Own Struggle at Home","MENA","Over the past two weeks, Marcelle George has watched with amazement as legions of Iranian women, most wearing black, full-length Islamic garments, defiantly protested Iran's leadership. Even in her native Egypt, where some opposition to the government is permitted, most women would never dare cross that line. ""To actually see Iranian women fight for their rights is inspiring,"" said George, a college student in jeans and a long-sleeve blouse. ""I never imagined that it could happen there."" As Iran's theocracy appears on the verge of silencing the biggest challenge to its authority since it was established in 1979, female activists in the region say they are inspired by the prominent role women are playing in the country's opposition movement. Many hope it will have a crossover effect on the struggle for women's rights in their own countries and help shatter Western perceptions of Middle Eastern women as subjugated in a male-dominated culture. In a region that reveres men who die in battle, some of the major icons to emerge from the Iranian demonstrations have been women. Neda Agha Soltan, the music student whose bloody death on June 20 was videotaped and broadcast around the world, became an instant symbol of the opposition movement and sparked widespread outrage. Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi 's wife, Zahra Rahnavard, has also taken on a prominent role as she accompanied her husband on the campaign trail and more recently spoke out against an election result that the opposition says was fraudulent. ""This is our time, women's time,"" said Khoulod Al Fahed, a Saudi businesswoman and blogger. ""It is the time for women to speak up and demand the rights that have been stolen from us in the name of religion and culture."" Middle Eastern women have long played active roles in the struggle for democracy and human rights. In recent months, women have won small yet unprecedented victories. In Kuwait, four female lawmakers were elected to parliament last month, the first time women have won seats in the nation's legislature. In Egypt, election law was recently changed to give women a quota of 64 parliamentary seats. Palestinian women have launched protests to free prisoners held by Israel, while Egyptian women have organized labor and pro-democracy strikes in recent years. But few events in recent memory have drawn as much attention as the sight of thousands of Iranian women taking to the streets, defiantly challenging their leaders and the election results. Grainy cellphone video and photos of the female protesters have flooded the Internet and the blogosphere, especially the haunting images of Agha Soltan as she died. ""Everyone is so shocked to see that beautiful young girl dying and looking so modern and secular,"" said Azar Nafisi, author of ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" and a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. ""What's happening in Iran is much more on a larger scale, with huge repercussions and risks,"" said Baho Abdula, 31, an Egyptian activist. ""It does break the stereotype of the Middle East women. And it shows the contradictions inside Iran. ""People trusted themselves, believed in something. And that feeling will live on long, especially with women. It was a huge empowerment to lead the protests,"" she added. ""They didn't fear the state. Images like that live on."" In Iran, such a prominent role is less surprising. Although women face discrimination in legal realms such as inheritance, custody and court testimony, they have a more visible, and more vocal, role in society and politics than in many countries in the region. In fact, some women found themselves with more opportunities after the 1979 Islamic revolution, as more traditional families began educating their daughters when the schools became segregated and Islamicized. The result has been the best-educated generation of women in Iranian history. More than 60 percent of university students are women, and female lawyers, doctors, athletes and politicians are not uncommon. There are female taxi drivers and even women in the Basij, a pro-government militia. A woman, Shirin Ebadi, won Iran's first Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. Many Iranians remember the participation of women in the revolution -- and afterward, when the ruling clerics sought to limit their rights. ""When Imam Khomeini first imposed edicts for veiling, women came in with such force that he had to take it back"" and introduce it more slowly, Nafisi said. At the time, the middle and working classes joined forces to oppose limitations on their rights, she said. ""It created a unity between different strata of women because they realized these laws applied to all of them."" This time, many prominent women joined the opposition movement because of Rahnavard, who campaigned alongside her husband. Rahnavard, a former chancellor of Tehran's Alzahra University for women, held hands with Mousavi as the couple entered auditoriums. ""The world there looked at women here as if they are all under the Taliban rule. For the first time, they are seeing that the Muslim woman is also a leader and a partner,"" said Sawsan Zakzak, head of the League of Syrian Women, in Damascus. In Iraq, which fought an eight-year war with neighboring Iran, many women say they have long admired the strong roles Iranian women played during the revolution. Once among the Arab world's most liberated, Iraqi women today are frequently targets of extremists or harsh tribal codes, with few rights or freedoms. ""We want Iraqi women to imitate Iranian women in boldly and courageously expressing their views, especially since Iraqi women do not lack courage or daring,"" said Samira Musawi, a lawyer and member of parliament with Iraq's ruling Shiite alliance. Aliya Nusayef, another Iraqi member of parliament, said many female lawmakers were voting on issues, including women's rights, based on ""what their political parties are telling them, not what they believe in."" ""Let us hope that Iranian women would spur our women to become involved and active in securing their rights,"" she said. But in ultraconservative parts of the Arab world, the Iranian uprising has underscored the immense obstacles women face in the region. In Saudi Arabia, women cannot vote. Nor are they allowed to drive. Although the government has enacted some changes, such as appointing the kingdom's first female deputy minister, clerics control the courts and apply an austere version of Sunni Islamic law. Fahed, the Saudi blogger, said many similarities exist between Iran and Saudi Arabia in their treatment of women. ""But women's battle in Iran is with the government. In Saudi Arabia, it is with the religious authority,"" Fahed said. ""I really believe that the Saudi government is in favor of change. But the religious authorities here are so powerful. Religious men are resisting any change in favor of women's rights."" Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese columnist who has produced a series of documentaries about Iran, said Iran's Shiite doctrine is less strict about the concept of female participation in society than the Sunni doctrine of most of the Arab world. Others say a mostly Sunni Arab society would not be influenced by Shiite Persian culture. ""What's going on will sure set an example, but I don't expect it to be reflected in any similar action,"" Moukalled said. ""It is much more difficult to stir change here."" Abdula, the Egyptian activist, said younger women will probably be the most influenced by the situation in Iran. Many have followed the events through blogs and social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. In interviews outside the gates of Cairo University and in cafes last week, a dozen young Egyptian women expressed solidarity with Iran's female protesters. They had all heard about Agha Soltan's death and expressed outrage and sympathy. Yet most doubted whether they as women could bring any meaningful reform to an authoritarian government such as Egypt's. Some said they were willing to try. ""It encourages me, but I don't know how to translate that into action,"" George said. ""We have to find ourselves a role to play here.""

"335","Afghan Law Ignites Debate on Religion, Sex; Cabinet Members, Other Leaders Protest Constraints on Minority Shiite Women","MENA","When Afghanistan's government quietly enacted a sweeping law last month restricting the rights of minority Shiite women, few Afghans were aware of what it said. But since the law's contents became known here just over a week ago, it has provoked an extraordinary public debate on the once-taboo topic of religion and sex in this conservative Muslim nation and spurred an unprecedented protest by senior officials. The law, which was approved by parliament and signed by President Hamid Karzai, codifies proper behavior for Shiite couples and families in the most intimate detail. It requires women to seek their husband's permission to leave home, except for ""culturally legitimate"" purposes such as work or weddings, and to submit to their sexual demands unless ill or menstruating. Initially seen as a political gesture to the country's Shiites, who make up 20 percent of the population and have long sought legal recognition of their religious beliefs, the law has become a political nightmare for a government struggling to balance conflicting pressures from traditional and modernizing forces at home and abroad. Not only has the law been denounced by the major Western governments on which the poor, insurgent-plagued country depends for economic and military aid, but it has also spurred a formal protest by several cabinet members and more than 200 other Afghan leaders, who said it treats women as ""objects"" and could lead to a new ""Talibanization"" of Afghanistan. ""I could not keep silent any longer,"" said Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta, one of the most prominent figures to sign the protest statement. In an interview, Spanta said he remained loyal to Karzai but could not bear to see Afghan democracy and human rights come under continued assault from religious extremists. The Shiite law, he said, had a ""totalitarian orientation that does not accept the difference between what is private and public. It identifies some Afghan citizens not as human beings but as slaves."" The law was approved after some debate and revisions, but Afghan human rights activists who reviewed the legislation in advance said most of their objections were ignored. They said a handful of conservative Shiite leaders pressured other legislators and Karzai into supporting it, on the grounds that the Shiite minority in this predominantly Sunni Muslim country deserved its own religious laws. ""That was supposed to be an achievement: to recognize Shias' legal rights so Hanafi [Sunni] laws would not be imposed on them,"" said Sima Samar, a Shiite woman who chairs the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission. ""But it was also used by a few leaders who want to put chains around half the population. It is good to have rules for marriage and divorce, but if I want my wife to wear pink lipstick and she wants to wear red, why should that be a matter of law?"" Conservative Shiite legislators and clerics who drafted and promoted the law have asserted that it protects women and guarantees wives ample rights, especially in areas such as child custody. They point out that several sections were modified after debate, loosening the restrictions on women leaving home and raising the minimum age for marriage. But another group of more moderate Shiite scholars said they had urged numerous changes that were never made. Their central argument was that certain aspects of family life, especially marital relations, should be kept private. They also said that Shiite jurisprudence allows for flexibility and modification in keeping with societal evolution. ""Sexual relations should be between a husband and wife. If they can solve their problems, the government has no right to interfere,"" said Amin Ahmadi, the president of a new Shiite college in Kabul, the capital. ""Nothing we proposed was against Islamic sharia, but in favor of human rights. There can be a more modern interpretation of these issues."" Mohammad Mohaqiq, a legislator and leader of the Shiite Hazara ethnic group who visited Washington this week, strongly condemned the law, saying it was a ""discriminatory and inhuman"" version proposed by ""radical clerics"" and not a more moderate negotiated version that had been approved by the upper house. He said it was ""in contradiction with human values common all over the world."" In addition to exposing differences among Shiite leaders, the controversy has also highlighted the conflicting pressures on Karzai, who is expected to run for reelection in August. The president is caught between the conservative senior clergy -- both Sunni and Shiite -- whose support he may need to win, and his Western backers, which promptly condemned the new law. ""I've expressed my concerns and objections about this law directly to President Karzai, and our president, President Obama, has spoken about the fact it truly is not in keeping with the direction that Afghanistan has been following,"" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said this week. Several other Western governments, NATO and the United Nations expressed similar outrage. Sources said Karzai was stunned by the foreign criticism. He has now promised to have the law thoroughly reviewed and to change any aspect that conflicts with the 2004 Afghan constitution, which endorses women's rights. The law is not yet being enforced, although Shiite clerical instructions follow its basic tenets. Meanwhile, the international outcry has prompted a nationwide discussion among Shiite and Sunni Afghans, mostly via call-in radio shows, about the long-taboo topics of sex and religion. Both the majority Sunnis and the minority Shiites espouse strong male authority over the family. But Shiites, who are mostly ethnic Hazaras, are considered more progressive than Sunnis, especially the ethnic Pashtun group that spawned the repressive Taliban movement in the 1990s. In the flurry of debate, some Afghan men have expressed concern that women might be tempted to have affairs if they are allowed out in public or have expressed outrage at what they see as foreign interference in their religious beliefs. But some women, especially those from an emerging, better-educated generation, have seized the opportunity to express their views on the need for more women's rights within Islam. One is Habiba Saddiqi, 23, an engineering student who has collaborated closely with UNIFEM, the U.N. women's organization that has a large program in Kabul and was among the first groups to raise alarms about the Shiite law. Saddiqi, who is Shiite, said she and her friends had collected thousands of signatures in the past week, calling for a more moderate version of the law. ""We need such a law, but it should be a democratic one,"" she said. ""This law is made by men for their benefit. If a father can order a daughter to marry whomever he likes, it means she has no rights. That is not good for women, and it is not good for society.""

"336","Saving the world, one woman at a time","MENA","If your impression of an Afghan woman is of a shapeless, frightened form engulfed in yards of heat-trapping fabric, you haven't met Shafiqa Quraishi. Make that Colonel Quraishi, who earned her title as one of 900-plus female members of the Afghan National Police. Quraishi, who today is director of gender, human and child rights within the Afghan Ministry of the Interior, was one of nine women in town last week to receive the International Women of Courage Award from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She and fellow Afghan award recipient Shukria Asil sat down Thursday for lunch and conversation with members of the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council to discuss ways to help women and children struggling for rights and security. Whatever you think you know about Afghanistan, the reality is probably far better -- and far worse. And though many women still wear burqas, they are less visible these days on city streets as women assume new roles. Speaking through interpreters, the two women reiterated a dominant theme that was repeated over and over during several days of events honoring brave women around the world. ""We are not victims."" Yes, of course, many have been victimized by brutal regimes in some cases, or by cultural forces, or by men who have hijacked religion to justify actions that would be treated as crimes in our part of the world. But these women are not seeking restitution; they are seeking empowerment. This is a crucial distinction that underscores the courage they display in the routine machinations we call everyday life. Female judges kiss their families goodbye in the mornings and make peace with their maker just in case they don't return. Parents send their daughters to school despite assaults such as the acid attacks on 15 schoolgirls and teachers in 2008. I heard the ""not victims"" refrain a day earlier from another group of women -- from Bahrain, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kenya, Brazil and Haiti -- here to be honored by Vital Voices Global Partnership, a nongovernmental organization that works to empower female leaders and social entrepreneurs around the world. Vital Voices, which grew out of the U.N.'s Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, focuses on advancing women as a U.S. foreign-policy goal. Translation: Empowering women will lead to greater prosperity and world peace. One cannot sit and talk with these women and escape inspiration. On one end of the spectrum is Afnan al Zayani, a chief executive from Bahrain who leads the Middle East and North Africa Businesswomen's Network. On the other is Rebecca Lolosoli, matriarch of Kenya's Umoja Village, an all-women's community she created to support women, girls, orphans and widows who had been abandoned by their families or were fleeing domestic violence, forced marriage or genital mutilation. It sort of puts that bad-hair day in perspective, doesn't it? But, again, they refuse to be victims. Roshaneh Zafar, who founded the first microfinance organization in Pakistan focusing on low-income women, is adamant on this point. She doesn't want to be rescued (nor does she have any interest in apologizing for her religion). ""Like all women everywhere, we want to be empowered."" That means jobs, money, security and government protection. And no, said the colonel, women do not need to do handicrafts. When you think of an Afghan woman, in other words, don't think of an embroidered tapestry; think of a cop. Tapestries are lovely, and we all want one, but Quraishi prefers that women have guns. Her immediate goal is to expand the number of women in the police force to 5,000. Hers is a daunting task in part because of cultural barriers. Both men and women have to be convinced that police work, as well as other nontraditional professions, is ""respectable"" for a woman. And before women can become professionals of any sort, they have to be educated. Only 30 percent of Afghan girls attend school, in part because of the danger but also because of poverty. Children are needed to work, if they are not already heads of household, as many are. Asil says that with $100 a month, a child can feed his family for a month. But where does one get that kind of money in a nation struggling to reinvent basic institutions? From people like those who are part of the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council and Vital Voices. If you can spare a dime, you could save a girl. Save a girl, save the planet. kathleenparker@washpost.com",2010,"Bahrain"
"337","Feminism, by way of the Koran","MENA","How Women Are Transforming the Middle East By Isobel Coleman Random House. 315 pp. $26 After Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, women were barred from working as judges or attending soccer matches, forced to wear hijab, and declared unequal to men in the realms of inheritance, testimony and divorce -- all under the pretext of hewing to Islamic tenets. But something interesting happened on the way back from the revolution, as Isobel Coleman describes in her new book, ""Paradise Beneath Her Feet."" As Iran's mullahs tightened control, women from conservative religious families who had never had a voice began to ride the very Islamic wave that seemed to be rising against them. Those who had been active in the revolution now elbowed their way into political and civil society, and universities were soon packed with women. Though it did so unintentionally, ""the Islamic takeover made formal girls' schooling acceptable to even the most conservative families,"" Coleman writes. ""Now that society was Islamized -- with girls wearing hijab and schools and many public places segregated -- how could a father say no?"" As fathers began to say yes, Iran's male-dominated leadership was busy isolating iteself from the international community. But Iranian women were connecting with the outside world: Their One Million Signatures campaign against discriminatory laws drew global recognition; the human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel Peace Prize; and one year ago last week, when Iranians took to the streets to protest suspicious election results, the symbol of the Iranian resistance became Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman whose death was broadcast on YouTube. It's not what the mullahs had in mind, but the trajectory of Iran's women gives Coleman hope that even in Muslim societies that present cultural and political obstacles, women are finding opportunities to rise up -- and to bring their countries up with them. The key, she writes, is to do so within Islamic paradigms. The director of the Council on Foreign Relations' Women and Foreign Policy program, Coleman traveled throughout the Muslim world, visiting relatively egalitarian societies such as Indonesia but focusing especially on five countries where women's rights are most tenuous -- Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq -- to support her view that while keeping women down keeps a nation down, the battle for gender equality is a continuing process and women are becoming smarter about engaging it. She introduces us to female politicians, journalists, entrepreneurs and educators, urban and rural, who are making impressive inroads, and she cites studies showing that societies that educate and invest in women become ""richer, more stable, better governed and less prone to fanaticism,"" while those that limit women's opportunities ""are poorer, more fragile, have higher levels of corruption and are more prone to extremism."" Despite the advances of women in places such as Iran, she argues that such countries are not nearly as advanced as they could be if women's opportunities were equal to men's. Women's rights have been slow to blossom in the Middle East, Coleman writes, in part because the principle is often associated with Westernization. Twentieth-century West-leaning modernizers such as Mustafa Kemal Ataturk bluntly denounced the veil without acknowledging its complex effect on society, while current politicians seek legitimacy by catering to anti-Western religious conservatives and sacrificing women's rights along the way. ""Islamic feminism"" can be a loaded term among those who see feminism as an illegitimate Western import. But according to Coleman, reform within an Islamic framework is the most promising avenue toward women's advancement. She introduces us to Muslims, both religious and secular, who engage in ijtihad, ""the process of arriving at new interpretations of Islamic law through critical reasoning, rather than blindly following the views of past scholars."" They use the Koran to show that gender inequality isn't an Islamic concept so much as a cultural one, and that extreme practices against women represent ""a subversion of Islamic teaching, its corruption by tribal customs and traditions."" Traditional societies do not tend to tolerate change imposed from the top, however, and turning ijtihad into action requires delicate maneuvering by insiders who can work with mullahs and politicians and resist the urge to superimpose Western-style feminism on Eastern societies. ""I don't want to criticize the work of foreigners,"" says Sakena Yacoobi, an Afghan woman Coleman meets who runs a women's health and education nonprofit, ""but when they come here and start teaching the women about their rights, the women often go home and criticize their husbands and their life just gets worse. We are helping the women learn how to negotiate with their husbands. The Quran is most helpful for that."" Coleman's feminists use modern technology to promote their message: Advocacy groups bombard policymakers with e-mail, and activists use YouTube to broadcast abuses captured on cellphone videos. An Egyptian television sex therapist who is popular across the Arab world uses the Koran to recommend foreplay, and an actor portraying a religious leader on a radio soap opera in rural Pakistan deprecates women to spark discussion among the show's characters and listeners. Coleman acknowledges the fragility of women's advancement. Hard-won rights have withered in the face of war, revolution and restrictive religious trends. In Iraq, for example, women in the early secular years of Baathist rule enjoyed some of the region's highest levels of female literacy and workforce engagement. But after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, when women's rights were subverted in an attempt to gain clerical support for the Baathist regime, female literacy plunged from 75 percent to less than 25 percent. Nor do all of Coleman's Islamic feminists succeed; some are killed or forced into exile, and even the successful ones have little hope of eradicating the ""strain of nihilism running on the fringes of Islam today."" Some grudgingly view the marriage of Islam and feminism as one of convenience, and they despair of achieving true equality in a religious context. Still, Coleman believes the Middle East's small but persistent streams of female activists are more likely to swell than to subside, and that with time they have the capacity to erode the barriers that have held them and their countries back.

"338","As partners in the revolution,Egypt's women foresee change","MENA","CAIRO - Women think as differently as they dress here, but they have emerged from the barricades agreeing on one thing: This is their moment in history, and they cannot afford to lose it. During 18 days of demonstrating for freedom and democracy, Egyptian men and women walked into Tahrir Square separate and unequal, divided by gender as they passed through checkpoints. Men were scrutinized by men, and women had their bags and person searched by other women. There were several lines of men to every one for the fewer numbers of women. Beyond the checkpoints, distinctions vanished and they stood side by side, defying the police, challenging the government, one and the same before the thugs throwing rocks and molotov cocktails. They died next to men and did not falter, steadfast for freedom and democracy. Now, as they leave the square behind them, they want to use the strength they revealed to address long-standing inequities, to make sure women have the equality in day-to-day life that they earned in Tahrir Square. ""It was amazing to see men and women together when we took to the streets,"" said Marwa Faroak, a political activist. ""A lot of people were saying Tahrir Square was the future of Egypt, men and women equal, fighting for freedom. And now we have to translate this into action and change."" Soha Abdelaty, deputy director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said Egyptians are building a new country, and women must be at the forefront so they can be effective advocates for their interests. She is optimistic but not yet ready to predict that women will indeed achieve more rights. ""There's a long way to go,"" she said. Women are far better off in Egypt than some parts of the Arab world. There are no religious police enforcing dress codes as in Iran, or prohibitions against driving as in Saudi Arabia. But Egyptian women are greatly underrepresented in public life and inferior to men before the law. They hold cabinet posts, but no judgeships. They are members of parliament, but have few seats. They occupy many professions, but not all. Divorces are difficult to obtain and favor men, as do property rights. Women are encouraged to marry and have children early: The legal age of marriage was only recently raised from 16 to 18. And, every day as they walk down the street, they are reminded of their low status - until Tahrir Square. Egyptian women are sexually harassed to an astonishing degree, groped, ogled, followed by catcalls, behavior that no law forbids. In a 2008 survey, the Egyptian Center for Women's Rights in Cairo found that 83 percent of Egyptian women and 98 percent of foreign women had been harassed at some point. Though the American television reporter Lara Logan was beaten and sexually assaulted as pro-Mubarak forces whipped up anti-American and anti-journalist frenzy in Tahrir Square, that attack was the brutal exception. Egyptian women who were in the square say they were treated with a tolerance they hardly expected. Woman after woman marveled at that. ""One of the things that gave me an incredible sense of wonder was how safe I felt,"" Faroak said. ""I spent the night there, with all kinds of different people, and Tahrir Square became safer than anywhere else for a woman to be."" Faroak, a 30-year-old lawyer, said that she feels more confident now as she goes to work and that an air of tolerance has persisted and must be maintained lest it dissipate along with the euphoria of victory. ""We were equal partners in this revolution,"" she said, ""and we are respected as such. Now we have to use the moment effectively, to make sure women participate in daily political life, to make sure they are involved in the development of political parties and labor movements."" A new generation Abdel Ibrahim Hassan, a man who came to Tahrir Square on Friday to celebrate the revolution with untold thousands of his fellow citizens, argued that women have an enviable standing already and that Western prejudices should not assume they need change. ""Islam respected the role of women before any other culture,"" said Hassan, a math teacher. ""Before Islam women were bought and sold. But men and women are not equal, a woman is a weak creature. She cannot bear arms."" His wife, Samah, bearing an Egyptian flag and wearing a black niqab covering her face with only small slits for her eyes, spoke up - strongly. ""I'm hoping our young people will be able to develop a democracy,"" she said, as she photographed the square with a sleek cellphone. ""Men and women will play an important part in the elections."" Their 15-year-old daughter, Sarah, her face and hands the only parts of her body visible from her enveloping black garments, interrupted. ""We demand seats in parliament for young people,"" she said, ""men and women. Women will play an important role in society after participating in the revolution of January 25th."" Hassan, who had brought his family from their home 50 miles away in the Sixth of October District, did not contradict her. ""A woman is not as physically strong as a man,"" Sarah said. ""But she has emotional virtues that he does not. A man can carry a wounded person to the hospital, but the woman will nurse him back to health."" Her life, Sarah said, will be different from the lives of her parents. ""We will campaign to change the role of women, to improve our education. This is our country, and we will build it with our own hands."" 'It is up to us' Elsewhere in the square, Noha Wagih, a 31-year-old woman with long flowing hair, was handing out information about volunteer and community groups. Earlier she had spoken excitedly about plans to hold classes to teach the constitution, ways to get women politically involved and organizing so that citizens can figure out how to take responsibility after 30 years of being told what to do and think. ""Women have been passive,"" she said. ""This has empowered us. Now we can achieve our dreams. It is up to us."" Wagih, who has been working in television and public relations, has been tweeting, sending cheerful Facebook messages and trying to mobilize women to work together for democracy - and their own rights. Professional urban women such as Wagih live in a different universe from poor village women, many of whom are forced by society or family to have children at an early age, preventing them from having choices about work or education. Domestic abuse is frequent, and social constraints prevent poor women from leaving their husbands. Many toil at low-paying jobs, supporting entire families. Although they know many obstacles lie ahead, and prospects of success are less than they hope, women here say they have been transformed, whether they were in the square or not. Ghada Shabandar, who is 48 and works for the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, was in the square with her 27-year-old daughter. She watched as her daughter grew more adamant, more courageous, more assertive day by day, refusing entreaties to leave, embarrassing her mother into staying. Back at home, Shabandar's 67-year-old mother worried constantly, calling six or seven times a day on her cellphone, frantic but supportive - and proud. ""Women were in the square,"" Faroak said. ""They cannot go back home."" lallyk@washpost.com",2011,"Egypt"
"339","Is revolution bad for women's rights?","MENA","On Friday, Egyptians again gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square, this time in a victory celebration, one week after their revolution http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/11/AR2011021102386. html-URL-unseated President Hosni Mubarak. Tunisians have also been sampling new freedoms of speech and press along a boulevard that is no longer a war zone. But even as the exultation lingers, women in both countries have launched new protests. They want to make sure that democracy does not erode their rights. In Tunisia, several hundred women have already taken to the streets to voice their concern about what an Islamic revival, should it come, could mean for them. In Egypt, women's rights activists immediately mounted a petition drive when the committee named to draft a new constitution included not a single woman (although many noted female Egyptian lawyers could easily serve on that committee). In both countries, there is popular support for a broader establishment of sharia, or Islamic law, developed from the Koran and religious writings. Of course, there is no single sharia; interpretations vary throughout the Middle East and are subject to change. Morocco, for example, sets the legal age of female marriage at 18, based on its more progressive version of sharia, whereas in Saudi Arabia girls as young as 8 are married to much older men, based on its version. As new leaders in the region grapple with how to blend some version of sharia with some version of democracy, women's rights will become a central element of the debate. The laws affecting women in Tunisia, and to some extent in Egypt, are among the most progressive in the Middle East, so the potential for backsliding in those countries is real. And women in Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Iraq, where the spreading unrest has been met with government force, have also struggled for their rights  and likewise have reason to be concerned if their governments fall or start handing out concessions. Tunisia, in particular, has been a bastion of women's rights in a region known for the opposite. Shortly after independence in 1956, President Habib Bourguiba, the country's secular authoritarian leader, pushed through a Personal Status Code which was remarkably liberal for its time. It granted women equal divorce rights to men, abolished polygamy, set minimum marriage ages, allowed access to birth control and even some access to abortion. Bourguiba modeled himself on Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's founder who force-marched his country into the modern age through a painful process of secularization - ""for the people, despite the people,"" as he once quipped. The result is that Tunisian women today enjoy relatively high literacy and have achieved broad gains in law, medicine, business, academia and media. Islam, meanwhile, has been tightly regulated; in Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali's police state, it was not uncommon for the authorities to question a person for switching mosques or attending one more than once a week. Popular Islamist leaders were arrested and exiled. Still, many women in Tunisia wear the headscarf despite its ban in public places. Enforced secularism never succeeded in stamping out religiosity. Democracy will inevitably bring Islamist groups into Tunisia's political mainstream. A few conservative voices have already made rumblings about revising aspects of the Personal Status Code, whereas moderate Islamists are quick to express support for women's rights and adherence to the current code. Rachid Ghannouchi, head of the formerly banned Islamist party Nahda, was once critical of the Personal Status Code and the country's anti-polygamy laws on religious grounds, but by the late 1980s he had come to terms with it. He recently returned to Tunisia after exile in London and has again reaffirmed his support for women's rights. The question is whether Ghannouchi's brand of moderate Islamism will carry the day in Tunisia. In Egypt, democracy will also create important openings for Islamist groups, especially the Muslim Brotherhood. In a 2007 Gallup survey, 64 percent of Egyptians polled said that sharia should be the only source of law in the country; an additional 24 percent said it should be a source of legislation. (There was little variation by gender.) Still, Egyptians' desire for sharia is balanced by a strong demand for modernization and a distaste for theocracy. Women's rights will be a litmus test for the new government - a sign of where the country is headed. The Muslim Brotherhood unleashed a sea of controversy in 2007 when it released its party platform excluding women (and non-Muslims) from the presidency, and calling for a group of Islamic scholars to review and veto legislation that does not conform to religious rules. These conservative positions confirmed critics' worst fears of the Brotherhood, and led to some soul-searching within the organization itself, especially among younger members who disagreed with the hard-line positions of their elders. So far, no women have been named to the small panel revising Egypt's constitution; hence the petition to the ruling Army Council. ""We collected more than 11,000 signatures in a few days,"" http://www.ashoka.org/staff_mena-URL-Iman Bibars, a prominent women's rights activist in Cairo, told me by phone. ""That's a huge number in such a short amount of time."" Bibars is sanguine about prospects for women in the new Egypt, although realistic too. ""We will have to fight for our rights,"" she said. ""It will be tough, and require lobbying, but that's what democracy is all about."" The constitutional reform process presents challenges for women's rights. Some role for sharia is inevitable in the new Egyptian constitution, as the existing one already establishes Islamic law as the main source of legislation. The real issue is what kind of Islam will exert most influence. The rise of Salafism, a particularly conservative form of the faith propagated by Saudi Arabia, should worry Egyptian women's groups. In recent years, tensions between secularists and Salafis have been rising, with Salafis calling for full veiling of women and gender segregation in universities. The Salafis' following is evident in the rising number of Egyptian women wearing the niqab, the face-covering veil, long black abayas and even gloves on their hands to avoid physical contact with men. Wearing the veil has become popular in Tunisia and Egypt for a variety of reasons, including as an expression of religious identity, conforming to social pressures and as a statement against the secular authoritarianism of the government. (The irony is that Egypt is the birthplace of Arab feminism, which in the first half of the 20th century put much energy into unveiling women.) With Hosni Mubarak gone, activists will now have to contend with hard-core politics in a way that has been missing from Egypt's Potemkin parliament. Controversial legislation, like the equal right to divorce that was passed in 2000, will come under pressure from Islamist lawmakers who fiercely opposed the bill. (Tunisia is the only other Arab country that grants women the right.) Women's groups can no longer fall back upon a sympathetic Mubarak regime, which often sided with their cause. In a more fluid democratic system, women's groups in Tunisia and Egypt will have to forge alliances with moderate religious leaders who promote progressive interpretations of sharia. Women's groups in countries such as Morocco, Jordan and, to some extent, Iran have succeeded in doing so, harnessing critical support on legislation affecting their rights. If a brave new world of electoral politics does emerge, women's rights activists will have to be savvy - commanding international support without raising fears of undue Western influence. When women in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, have faced disastrous rollbacks of their rights in the name of religion, they have called in the international media and shamed their governments into backing down. Tunisian and Egyptian activists should know that women's rights often become bargaining chips for some other agenda. In Iraq, the American-appointed Governing Council wasted no time in trying to rescind the Baathists' progressive family law and replace it with religious law. Only a backlash from women's groups, and a U.S. veto, prevented the move. In the months ahead, women in Tunisia and Egypt must be ready to face similar watershed moments. icoleman@cfr.org Isobel Coleman is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400066956?ie=UTF8&tag=slatmaga-20&linkCode=as2 &camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400066956-URL-""Paradise Beneath Her Feet: How Women are Transforming the Middle East.""

"340","Grabbing the car keys in the House of Saud","MENA","This month'sdriving protest by Saudi women, despite significant hype and international coverage, was a far cry from the massive demonstrationsthat have rocked other Arab countries this revolutionary season. Only a few dozen women got behind the wheel, roughly the same number as during the last public driving protest, 20 years ago. The government looks at the numbers and maintains, straight-faced, that women's rights are simply not a big deal to most Saudis. The party line remains the same as King Abdullah patiently expressed to Barbara Walters in a 2005 interview: While he personally believes ""strongly in the rights of women,"" he said, he would not issue a royal decree to allow them to drive. ""I cannot do something that is unacceptable in the eyes of my people."" The problem for the monarch now is that a lot of his people have been looking at YouTube, where the protest is amplified over and over. There, videos posted by protesters show that the world is not upended when women are in the driver's seat. In many of the videos, husbands, fathers and brothers are sitting in the passenger seat, beaming proudly. The women are simply going about their ordinary chores - and changing conservative mores along the way, as the very public debate over the protests makes clear. Saudi restrictions on women are not going to melt away. More likely, a growing middle-class acceptance of women's rights, promoted by activists, business leaders, educators, journalists and even moderate religious leaders, will exacerbate the long-simmering tensions between tradition and modernity, between fundamentalist and moderate Islam, that have gripped Saudi society for decades. Why? Because control over women is at the heart of the harsh version of Islam that Saudi theocracy imposes on the country. The 18th-century bargain struck between Muhammad ibn Saud, a direct forefather of today's ruling Sauds, and Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, the eponymous ""Wahhabi,"" persists: The Sauds have political control of the country, and the descendents of Wahhab exert social and religious control. As revolutions swept the region this spring, Saudi Arabia's ruling clerics offered up helpful fatwas and sermons against public demonstrations and in support of the monarchy. In return, the religious establishment was richly rewarded with about $200 million to their organizations, according to the New York Times. The Saudi government is not about to anger religious conservatives at this tenuous time by going soft on the touchstone issue of women's rights. But the Sauds'  bargain with the clerics that sustains the nation's medieval system will become increasingly unsustainable as more and more Saudis question the restrictions imposed on them in the name of religion. Twenty years ago, when the first group of intrepid women protested by driving around Riyadh, they were roundly denounced in the press and labeled ""whores"" and ""infidels."" Those working in the public sector were fired from their jobs by royal decree. The leading religious authorities quickly issued fatwas formally banning women from driving, saying it contradicts Islam by degrading women's dignity. This time around, Manal al-Sharif, the woman arrested in May for posting videos of herself driving, was quickly lauded as the ""Rosa Parks of Saudi Arabia."" The Facebook group she created, Women2Drive, had more than 20,000 members within a few weeks. It is no surprise that she and Wajeha al-Huwaider, the two most prominent female leaders of the Women2Drive campaign, have both been employed by Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, which plays an important role in Saudi modernization. Saudi critics have mocked the Women2Drive campaign and disparaged its leaders for being divorced and Shiite. A dueling Facebook site called Iqal- after the Arabic word for the cord that holds in place the headdress that men in the Persian Gulf region traditionally wear - urged men to beat women with the cord if they dared to drive. The site was taken off Facebook for inciting violence, but not before thousands ""liked"" it. Some Saudi women have also spoken out against driving and, indeed, against any expansion of women's rights. Rawdah Al-Yousif, for example, is the Phyllis Schlafly of Saudi Arabia. She launched a movement in 2009 called My Guardian Knows What's Best for Me. She argues that Islamic law and Saudi customs mandate the rules that require women to have a guardian's permission to do many essential activities, including accessing government offices such as courts, traveling, studying, seeking employment and getting health care. Her organization is headed by two princesses who, in a Saudi version of let-them-eat-cake, argue that life is easier when men take care of these tasks. Yousif calls her liberal opponents ""ignorant and vexatious,"" and she posted a video on Twitter describing the driving activists as ""Westernized rich brats."" However, several prominent men have urged in opinion pieces that women be allowed to drive, and some outspoken members of the advisory Shura Council have criticized the driving ban in economic terms. They decry the need to import nearly 1 million foreign chauffeurs, who send home more than $4 billion in annual remittances, as a drain on the Saudi economy. Important business leaders have stressed the inefficiencies caused by the ban and acknowledge that it is an embarrassment to them on the international stage. Even some moderate Islamic scholars have stated that there is no religious justification for preventing women from driving. One battle to repress women has already been lost. In the early 1960s, clerics strenuously fought girls' education, arguing that it would start the country down a slippery slope from which there was no return. They were right. Today, some 60 percent of the college graduates in Saudi Arabia are women, and increasingly they clamor for more than the 5 percent of jobs they hold. Several universities now offer engineering degrees for women. The female leaders who fought for those opportunities often said the driving debate was a distraction from their larger concerns. But recent events seem to have changed the minds of some. Saudi journalist and activist Sabria Jawhar says that while she used to think that the endless driving debate was trivial, now ""the driving ban is no longer a distraction to Saudi women's quest for their rights, but could very well be the centerpiece of our struggle to obtain rights long denied us."" She is right. The clerical establishment will not roll over on this issue or on any others pertaining to women's rights. So Saudi women - and men - will have to fight for them and force the royals to choose sides. The kingdom's octogenarian rulers have aligned with the clerics: Abdullah, widely seen as a reformer, made clear long ago that he was interested in only incremental changes for women, and his powerful half-brother, Interior Minister Prince Nayef, who oversees the religious police, takes an even harder line. (He was seen as responsible for arresting and detaining Manal al-Sharif for nine days.)

"341","Iranian Women Foresee More Battles With Moslem Clergy","MENA","In the forefront of the struggle against the shah and the first group to challenge the new revolutionary order, Iranian women seem determined to demonstrate anew if necessary to defend rights threatend by the Moslem clergy. Today Iranian women are watching with undisguised suspicion the Moslem clergy's efforts to regulate their professional and personal lives.  Their feelings are shared by many generally more cautious Iranian men fearful of other aspects of real or threatened clerical dictatorship. But unlike the men, Iranian women -- if a series of interviews accurately reflects the national mood -- appear willing to take to the streets again rather than knuckle under to the increasingly despised and mocked clergy. Many of the worst fears that prompted the women's marches in the winter of 1979 soon after the revolution have not been realized.  But the threat remains that the new parliament, dominated by the right-wing clerical Islamic Republican Party, will try to vote laws barring women from various occupations, restricting their rights and reducing them to second-class citizens. ""The clergy wants to put the country back 1,400 years by applying Islamic law,"" one prominent woman lawyer said in an interview.  ""But Iranian women are stubborn.  We will not sit with folded arms.  We will demonstrate if necessary."" Raising such suspicions have been various decisions by the government.  As was the case in motivating the 1979 marches, restrictions on dress have been the most obvious cause of dismay.  Yet women employes of the state railway reportedly are resisting orders that they wear head scarves and a uniform of tunic and pants. Segregation of the sexes now begins in school and applies to public bathing and even wedding receptions. A woman lawyer said she was convinced that the clergy is ""trying to get rid of women in government jobs."" She noted that all five senior women judges in Tehran have been removed from their jobs and quietly given less visible work in the Justice Ministry. A colleague criticized the women judges for accepting their fate without a fight and said they apparently feared being transferred to the provinces had they protested. Women lawyers have been in the forefront of the successful fight to prevent the clergy from simply abrogating the Family Protection Act passed in 1967 to safeguard women's rights. Divorce proceedings are still handled by civil courts rather than Islamic ones. Islamic law, in theory at least, allows a man to divorce his wife by repeating three times, ""I divorce thee."" Child custody proceedings now openly favor the father and, if he is not around or is considered incompetent, his family rather than the mother, according to women lawyers. ""It's out-and-out male supremacy,"" a lawyer said. If many Iranians of both sexes are increasingly outspoken about clerical interference in politics and everyday life, it is often the women who are more militant, possibly because they have borne the brunt of decisions ordered by Iran's new, self-appointed keepers of morality. Without exception, however, the women interviewed drew a clear distinction between the meddlesome clergy and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolution's leader.  He was not held responsible for the excesses. The only woman who felt fearless enough to be quoted by name was Azam Taleghani, daughter of the late nonconformist ayatollah widely respected for his tolerance of other religions and the political left.  She is one of three women elected to the 270-seat parliament. Other women interviewed were all more cautious.  A beautiful young upper-class woman, dressed in matching pink blouse, pants and shoes, was clearly upset by unsubstantiated rumors that fanatics had thrown acid on women who refused to wear the full-length chador or cover their heads. ""If I go downtown I think twice about what I wear,"" she said.  ""Maybe I've gotten more scared and paranoid, but if I have to go to government offices . . . I wear a dark skirt and no makeup.  Why takes chances?"" An older, well-established woman lawyer said she goes to court in short sleeves, considered dangerously erotic by the clerical purists, and without covering her head. ""No one can force me to put a scarf on my head or change my thinking,"" she said, ""but other women can wear the chador.  That doesn't bother me as long as they are not dominated by their fathers, husbands and brothers."" Like many of those interviewed she said she was counting on the three women members of parliament to defend women's rights. ""We are going to watch them like hawks and keep track of every little thing,"" she said.  ""And if the clergy go too far they'd better watch out."" Azam Taleghani, dressed in strict head scarf and a black, formless dress, said she had hoped that ""50 women would be elected."" She made clear she would defend not only women's rights, but also the open brand of Islam associated with her family. Imprisoned along with her father under the monarchy, reportedly tortured and raped before his eyes by secret policemen, she is enormously respected even by those who disagree with her politics. She pointedly refused endorsement during the parliamentary campaign by the Islamic Republican Party, which many Iranians hold responsible for the puritanical, narrow-minded and quasi-totalitarian tendencies in the revolution. Although she decried the party's hard-line tactics, she said the left, too, had been at fault in trying to take over the universities, bringing on clashes with Moslem fundamentalists. Choosing her words with the care of a practiced politician, she answered a question about the Islamic Republicans without naming the party. ""As long as there is blood in my veins,"" she said, ""we must fight against groups who do not let real Islam be established.""",1980,"Iran"
"342","Many Women Sharply Opposed; Feminists Seek Voice In Kuwaiti Politics","MENA","Undeterred by the rise of Islamic fundamentalism throughout the Persian Gulf region and several initial setbacks, Kuwaiti women are pushing ahead in their struggle to gain the right to vote in the national parliament. The women's liberation movement is under way, according to Lulwa Qattami, Kuwait's leading feminist and head of the Women's Cultural and Social Society of Kuwait, who seems to be unperturbed by the political storm brewing here over the issue. ""It is very important for women to be in parliament,"" she said in an interview at the society's headquarters. ""There are so many issues that deal with women--the family and such."" As for all other political reforms in the conservative Arab kingdoms and sheikdoms of the gulf, Kuwait is light years ahead of its neighbors in posing the question of women's voting rights. Elsewhere, men are still waiting to get the franchise. Furthermore, the ruling emir, Jaber Sabah, and Crown Prince Saad Sabah, the prime minister, are both on record as being in favor of women voting, giving the campaign an enormous boost. Typical of the divisions running through Kuwaiti society, however, the crown prince's wife, Latifa, has come out against it, saying few of the women involved in political activities ""have the necessary understanding in this regard."" If women here gain the right to vote in parliamentary elections, they could possibly form a majority of all voters since they constitute 52 percent of the roughly 600,000 Kuwaitis. But Kuwait's society, where almost every domestic issue is out in the open and heatedly debated, remains deeply divided. So far as one can glean from the public discussion, a majority of women is still either indifferent or actively against the idea--not to mention the men. For instance, when Qattami led a group of women on parliament in January 1982 to get the issue on its agenda, a countermovement sprang up among Kuwaiti women opposing their right to vote. ""There is no agreement about their rights or the approach to this issue,"" said Moudi Hamoud, head of Kuwait University's Faculty of Commerce, who regards it as the ""main issue"" facing Kuwaiti society today. ""They are very organized,"" she said, referring to the women's lobby against the vote. ""We as liberal women are not so organized. They have the support of religious groups in society while we don't have any such group as liberals."" Hamoud said she felt the first step the liberals should take was to organize ""to speak as one voice"" and that it was still ""too early"" in the women's movement to press for the vote. The two main Sunni fundamentalist groups are the Islamic Reform Society and the more radical Islamic Cultural Heritage Society. Khaled Sultan, who leads the latter, said he did not believe Kuwaiti society had reached the stage in its political evolution where women should participate in national elections. ""It's too early in the game,"" he remarked in an interview during which he made clear he felt the women's place was in the home. Besides, he added, ""There is no consensus among women themselves. Very few have asked for women to vote."" Qattami dismisses the antivote sentiment among women and men as natural and unimportant. ""It is normal to have people for and against it,"" she said, adding that she felt the strongest opposition was still among the men. ""It's a matter of mass education,"" she said. ""Our job is to raise the consciousness among women."" Qattami, whose father was a strong advocate of female education in the 1920s, noted that Kuwaiti women participated in voting for the councils that head the cooperative societies in Kuwait City's 57 districts as well as those for the country's 42 social or cultural societies. Qattami has headed the Women's Society since 1966. She believes she has a strong constitutional case for her cause and seems now to be concentrating on this rather than a program of ""mass education."" She cites in particular Article 29 of the constitution, which states all Kuwaitis are ""equal in human dignity, public rights and duties before the law without distinction as to sex, origin, language or religion."" Having given up on parliament after a heated row during one session in February 1982, she is now turning to the courts to redress the grievances of those in favor of the vote. Until recently, however, the problem was how to make a legal issue out of them. This was solved on Feb. 11, when she and other like-minded women stormed the voting registration offices at police stations in the capital's 25 electoral districts. All were forbidden to register by confused and embarrassed officers. This allowed them to challenge on legal grounds Article 1 of the voting law, which says only men have the right to participate in parliamentary elections. Qattami's Women's Society is now preparing a case to take before the constitutional Supreme Court with the help of volunteers from the Lawyers Society. She said the case would probably be heard in the next few months. Whether or when women may finally obtain the right to vote in Kuwait is not clear. It will not be in time for the next parliamentary elections, which will probably take place next February or March. But Qattami confidently predicts that Kuwaiti women will be on the registration lists by the time the following elections take place in 1989--""God willing,"" she quickly added.",1984,"Kuwait"
"343","Iraq Opens New Doors For Women War With Iran Helps Climate for Equality","MENA","Women wearing the floor-length black robe of the devout Moslem female make bricks at a rural kiln, taking the place of men who have left to fight Iran. Government offices have hired hundreds of women for administrative as well as secretarial jobs. The Air Force Academy has graduated several women as fighter pilots, although they apparently have not flown any combat missions yet. With a generation of men at the front, new doors are opening for women in wartime Iraq. A severe labor shortage in a country that already is underpopulated has pulled women into the work force and accelerated their emancipation from traditional roles. The experience of Iraqi women is similar to that of American women during World War II, when ""Rosie the Riveter"" became the nickname for the woman war industry worker. Women here enjoy the support of their secular government, which is publicly committed to female liberation. The situation is distinctly different on the other side of the 26-month-old Persian Gulf war. In Iran, the Islamic revolutionary government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urges women to stay at home and to accept a subordinate position generally. ""There is nothing in the Koran that says that women should not work,"" insisted a member of the executive council of the state-backed General Federation of Iraqi Women. ""The war has pushed us out more into society, because so many jobs have been left open."" No figures are available on how many women have taken jobs during the war, but residents say that the change has been dramatic. Women today make up about three-fourths of the workers in some government ministry offices in Baghdad, where previously they constituted only one-fourth of the employes. Women work on assembly lines making heavy vehicles, in textile factories and at tile-making plants. ""The women's jobs are not necessarily the low-ranking ones,"" said a West European businessman who lives in Baghdad. ""At my bank, the male teller will ask me to get the approval of his female supervisor to change money."" Jobs have been plentiful in Iraq -- the land that was ancient Mesopotamia -- since the oil boom that began in 1973. With petroleum reserves second only to neighboring Saudi Arabia and fertile plains between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the country has more resources than its 14 million citizens can handle. About 2 million foreigners, mainly from Egypt and other poor Islamic countries, are employed here. The labor shortage became dire, however, with the wholesale conscription of men. Virtually all Iraqi men between the ages of 18 and 34 are in the armed forces or the nation's extensive security services. The government has encouraged the hiring of women. The ruling Baath Party, which espouses an ideology blending socialism and Arab nationalism, seeks to uproot many traditional Islamic practices that restrict women. ""Women make up one-half of society. Our society will remain backward and in chains unless its women are liberated, enlightened and educated,"" said President Saddam Hussein in a comment that frequently is quoted by Iraqi women's groups. Despite women's gains, no woman belongs to the ruling, nine-member Revolutionary Command Council or heads a government ministry. The women's federation, a mass organization funded by the government, operates more than 50 nurseries to care for children of working mothers. Since the start of the war, the nurseries have begun staying open until 7:30 p.m. instead of closing at 3 p.m. as before. The government, committed to increasing the population, outlaws contraceptives and abortion. With the war, however, it has trimmed some maternity benefits to encourage women to stay at their jobs. Nursing mothers, who once received fully paid leaves for six months after the birth of a child, now receive only half pay for that period. In Iran, women are punished for going outside their homes without covering themselves according to the rules of orthodox Shiite Islam. Women in Iraq are permitted to wear the abayah, as the head-to-toe black robe is called in Arabic, but it is seen mostly in the countryside. Women in the capital tend to wear sleek, European fashions with high heels, jewelry and plenty of makeup. In a landmark 1979 act, the Iraqi government liberalized laws on divorce and polygamy. Men -- who previously had been able to dump their wives merely by saying, ""I divorce you"" -- now must go to court. For the first time, women received the right to seek divorce from their husbands for cruelty or other grounds. The law also made it necessary for men to obtain permission from their first wife or wives before taking additional ones. Under Moslem law, a man may have four wives at once. The flood of women into the work force has raised some objections. Men in some small towns protested that their wives, daughters or sisters should not walk home alone in the evening after work. Economic pressures have prevailed, however, and women regularly work both day and evening shifts. ""If the war goes on, we're going to have to put them on overnight as well,"" said an undersecretary at the Economics Ministry.",1982,"Iraq"
"344","Egypt Passes Law On Women's Rights; Polygamy Still Allowed for Men","MENA","Vowing to make ""no encroachment on a man's right to polygamy,"" the Egyptian government passed a new law today recognizing certain basic rights for women. The new legislation is a milestone for women here, but also demonstrates President Hosni Mubarak's desire to avoid a major confrontation with Egypt's Moslem fundamentalists. Its passage comes in the face of growing political pressure from fundamentalists who have joined to demand that Islamic law, or the sharia, be strictly applied here. In another development concerning the issue of Islamic law, the government today dismissed Sheik Hafez Salama who had tried to stage a march to demand the strict application of sharia. The government appointed another sheik for his mosque in the Cairo suburb of Kubbeh. Because it touches on issues of family and deep tradition as well as religion, the law dealing with marriage is at the emotional center of this debate. ""For some of these sheiks,"" or religious leaders, said one American scholar here, ""this issue is as emotional as the abortion question in the United States."" The main effect of today's action was to reinstate the law on marriage passed in 1979. The 1979 law, decreed by then-president Anwar Sadat without the consent of parliament, was ruled unconstitutional two months ago. But public discontent with the law had been mounting for months. Often called the ""Jihan law,"" because it was pushed by Sadat's westernized wife, the 1979 law declared that polygamy was legally harmful to a first wife and automatically gave her the right to divorce her husband. The wife also had the right under the 1979 law to keep custody of young children and the family dwelling after the divorce. In Cairo, a city of at least 12 million people, each square foot of living space is valuable. The idea of giving up an inch of space in a divorce makes the whole issue of divorce extremely sensitive. Until 1979 a man could divorce his wife by saying, simply, ""I divorce you"" three times. And he was under no legal compulsion to inform her of what he had done. The 1979 law required that all divorces be legally registered and that the wife be informed. When the 1979 law was repealed, however, these rights went out the window and the effective law was the one passed 50 years before. ""Medieval,"" is the way one woman intellectual described it. But there were many men and some women here who considered it appropriate in this society where religious fundamentalism is ever more conspicuous. Its provisions are closely linked to the standard interpretations of the sharia. Today's action was criticized by many women activists, who had proposed new legislation. Shahida Baz of the Committee for the Defense of Women and Family, called the new law ""a kind of avoidance,"" adding: ""The government did not want to be accused of being anti-Islamic."" Yet even its liberal critics concede that from their perspective the new law could have been much worse. ""It wasn't the best,"" said Aziza Hussein, one of the most prominent activists for women's rights in Cairo. ""But it is better than nothing.""",1985,"Egypt"
"345","Canada Court Says Pornography Harms Women","West","The Supreme Court of Canada yesterday ruled that although the nation's criminal obscenity law infringed on the freedom of expression, it was legitimate to outlaw pornography that was harmful to women. In a unanimous decision, the court also redefined obscenity as sexually explicit material that involves violence or degradation. ""This makes Canada the first place in the world that says what is obscene is what harms women, not what offends our values,"" said Catharine A. MacKinnon, a University of Michigan law professor who worked with the women's advocacy group that argued for the new standard. ""In the United States the obscenity laws are all about not liking to see naked bodies, or homosexual activity, in public. Our laws don't consider the harm to women. But in Canada it will now be materials that subordinate, degrade or dehumanize women that are obscene."" The court acknowledged that women and children are usually the subjects of pornography, but it said that materials that degrade men would also be covered by the law. The decision was issued in the case Butler v. Her Majesty the Queen, which involved the owner of a Manitoba shop that sold and rented out sexually explicit videotapes and magazines. The owner, Donald Victor Butler, was prosecuted under laws prohibiting the manufacture, sale or distribution of obscene material, possession of obscene material for distribution or sale, or public display of obscene material. Defining Obscene Material The Canadian criminal law provides that any publication that has as a ""dominant characteristic"" the ""undue exploitation of sex"" is obscene. Offenders are usually fined rather than jailed, and the law does not cover those who keep such material for their private use. Mr. Butler challenged the charges on the ground that the material was protected by the guarantee of freedom of expression provided in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, passed in 1982. In the Butler case, the trial judge ruled that some of the material in question was indeed protected by the guarantee of freedom of expression in the charter, and Mr. Butler was subsequently acquitted of some charges but convicted of others. The crown then appealed the acquittals. In its decision in the case, the court of appeal ruled that the materials in question were not protected by the charter because they involved undue exploitation of sex. Yesterday the high court upheld that view and in so doing provided a new standard for judging such materials. ""This case is the first test of the obscenity laws under the charter's provision on freedom of expression"" said Kathleen Mahoney, the lawyer who argued the case for the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund, a nonprofit women's advocacy group in Toronto. ""But the charter also has a strong equality section. The court said that while the obscenity law does limit the charter's freedom of expression guarantee, it's justifiable because this type of expression harms women personally, harms their right to be equal, affects their security and changes attitudes toward them so they become more subject to violence."" In its decision, the high court acknowledged that the effect of its ruling would be to restrict the protections provided in the nation's charter to a citizen's right of free expression. But, addressing the nature of pornography, the court said the harm caused by ""the proliferation of materials which seriously offend the values fundamental to our society is a substantial concern which justifies restricting the otherwise full exercise of the freedom of expression."" Indeed, the court recognized a growing concern that the sexual exploitation of women and children, depicted in publications and films, can lead to abject and servile victimization. The court set a precedent in expressly accepting the argument that pornography harms women. ""If true equality between male and female persons is to be achieved, we cannot ignore the threat to equality resulting from exposure to audiences of certain types of violent and degrading material,"" the opinion said. ""Materials portraying women as a class as objects for sexual exploitation and abuse have a negative impact on the individual's sense of self-worth and acceptance."" In the United States, Ms. MacKinnon and others have led several attacks against pornography on the ground that it harms women, but they have not been successful. Those efforts have not involved criminal obscenity laws, but rather proposed new ordinances that would allow civil suits for the damages caused by pornography. And this has caused a bitter polarization among feminists. Feminist leaders, including Betty Friedan and Kate Millett, and a number of groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Booksellers Assocation, denounced as censorship a proposed anti-pornography ordinance in Minneapolis that would have allowed women to sue the makers and distributors of pornography if they could prove that they had been harmed by the materials. The ordinance, which was vetoed by the Mayor, covered pornographic material that depicted, in pictures or words, the ""graphic, sexually explicit subordination"" of women. That could include, for example, women portrayed as sexual objects who take pleasure in being raped. Indianapolis Case Cited A similar ordinance was adopted in Indianapolis but was invalidated in 1985, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, said the law was an unconstitutional violation of the guarantee of free speech. The ruling was later affirmed without comment by the United States Supreme Court. But even so, Judge Frank H. Easterbrook, who wrote the Seventh Circuit opinion, apparently accepted the argument, as did the Canadian high court, that pornography could harm women. ""Depictions of subordination tend to perpetuate subordination,"" he wrote. ""The subordinate status of women, in turn, leads to affront and lower pay at work, insult and injury at home, battery and rape on the streets."" Ms. MacKinnon said yesterday that the fight for anti-pornography laws based on harm to women would be continuing and would soon move to the Federal level. ""There are going to be several pieces of legislation in Congress soon, predicated on the harm approach and recognizing that both the making of pornography and its use do harm to women,"" she said. Community Standards The Canadian decision still allows individual prosecutors to decide which materials violate community standards of tolerance and meet the test of ""undue sexual exploitation"" required by the law. But the court recognized the difficulty of deciding which pornographic materials meet that test. In its decision the court offered new guidelines. ""The portrayal of sex coupled with violence will almost always constitute the undue exploitation of sex,"" it said. But it added that some explicit sexual material that was nonviolent could also be prosecuted, if it was degrading or dehumanizing. ""Degrading or dehumanizing materials place women (and sometimes men) in positions of subordination, servile submission or humiliation,"" the court said. ""They run against the principles of equality and dignity of all human beings."" Moreover, the court said, the fact that the subjects of such materials consent to participate in their production does not mean that the materials are not degrading. ""Consent cannot save materials that otherwise contain degrading or dehumanizing scenes,"" the opinion said. ""Sometimes the very appearance of consent makes the depicted acts even more degrading or dehumanizing. This type of material would apparently fail the community standards test not because it offends against morals, but because it is perceived by public opinion to be harmful to society, particularly to women."" Canadian law provides that explicit sexual material that has an artistic purpose or is part of the serious treatment of a sexual theme will not be prosecuted as obscene.",1992,"Canada"
"346","France Rethinks Its Wink at Sex Harassment","West","For decades, the gap between French and American cultures could be measured through sex -- the French made saucy movies, kissed in public and boasted of extramarital affairs, while Americans treated sex as something between a secret ritual and an embarrassing necessity. That, at least, was how many of the French saw things. Indeed, as recently as last fall, when the problem of sexual harassment dominated Judge Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court, a good many French men viewed the scandal as a display of, if not puritanism, certainly hypocrisy. Now, however, it seems that not all is well behind France's facade of sexual freedom. Some French men may think they are the natural heirs to ""le droit de cuissage"" -- the squire's right to spend the wedding night with the new brides of his estate -- but more and more women think otherwise. This week, the Government finally came to the defense of women. Under a new bill approved by the Cabinet and soon to be taken up in Parliament, sexual harassment in the workplace would become a crime punishable by up to 12 months' imprisonment and fines between $360 and $3,600. The law is a direct result of the Thomas case, which stirred France's first debate about the use of power or position to extract sexual favors. Polls showed that at least one in five people in France felt that they had been victims of sexual harassment. French Government officials assert that the new law is the toughest of its kind in Europe, going far beyond the code of conduct drafted by the European Community last November. The code has been sent to employers, labor unions and workers in the community's 12 member nations with a view to increasing awareness of the problem. Already in January, at the insistence of Yvette Roudy, a Socialist lawmaker, the French Parliament amended the penal code to make sexual harassment punishable by a jail sentence of up to one year and a fine of up to $18,000. The significance of the new law, which will be part of the labor code, is that the campaign against sexual harassment now has full Government backing. ""Obviously, most harassment is by men against women,"" said an official at France's Ministry of Women's Rights, which promoted the new law. ""But this is not a sexist bill and we did not specify men when defining sexual harassment."" Perhaps the biggest concession to French ways is that the law will apply only to sexual harassment by hierarchical superiors in the workplace, with the idea of differentiating between sexual blackmail and old-fashioned -- albeit unwanted -- flirtation by colleagues. Veronique Neiertz, the Secretary of State for Women's Rights, has even criticized attitudes in the United States, where she says ""the slightest wink can be misinterpreted."" Her ministry's advice to women who feel harassed by fellow workers is ""a good slap in the face."" Certainly, a recent poll in the magazine Le Point suggested that French women are less sensitive than American women to some forms of harassment. Responding to a series of questions about hypothetical situations, 20 percent of the women surveyed said they would not consider themselves harassed if they were asked to undress during a job interview. In another scenario, a male manager suggests that a woman employee spend a weekend with him to discuss her request for a promotion. Among women, 47 percent considered this to be harassment and 45 percent did not, with the balance giving no answer; 45 percent of the men thought it was harassment, while 51 percent did not. But conversations with working women in Paris point to rapidly changing attitudes toward long-entrenched male practices. ""All too many men think they are being charming when they're being a pain,"" a journalist said. Marie-Victoire Louis, who leads an association against violence inflicted on women in the work place, is among those who are unhappy that the new law deals only with sexual harassment by superiors. ""In the name of progress, we're being disarmed against other forms of harassment,"" she said.",1992,"France"
"347","Greystones Journal; Irishwomen, Just Talking: The Topic Is Abortion","West","In 1983, Maureen Casey and most of her friends, wives of professional men in this seaside town 18 miles south of Dublin, favored the constitutional amendment that was supposed to be a comprehensive ban on abortion in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. The women felt that abortion was sinful and followed the church's urging for a yes vote, as did two-thirds of the country. But abortion is again the center of an impassioned national debate and, like an increasing number of Irishwomen of all ages, Mrs. Casey and her friends, now about 50 years old and mothers of four or five children each, are being introspective again. Many women of Greystones, a suburban town ideologically between the conservatism of rural areas and the liberalism of Dublin, reject groups calling either for a categorical ban on abortion as murder or for abortion on demand as an inherent female right. The new debate among Irishwomen involves a changing attitude toward the traditional Catholic prohibition not only of abortion but also of contraception and divorce. Recent polls show that most Irish now favor some form of legal divorce, limited abortion and freedom to travel abroad for abortions and receive printed abortion information here. 'A Big Change' ""There is a big change in Ireland,"" Mrs. Casey said. ""Priests don't have the influence they used to."" ""Particularly in the bedroom,"" said her neighbor, Mary Killeen, in a recent afternoon discussion at the Casey home. In Dublin, Frances Fitzgerald, head of the Council for the Status of Women, a middle-of-the-road amalgam of women's organizations, said: ""We've come a long way since 1983. I voted against it, but my mother was for it. Now she sees the need for flexibility."" Abortion rose to haunt the nation again in February when a Supreme Court decision appeared to open new grounds for legal abortion. The court overruled a Government order forbidding travel to Britain for an abortion by a 14-year-old girl who said she had been raped. Opponents of abortion are calling for a new, ironclad constitutional amendment to ban abortion in all situations. On the other side of the issue, liberals want at least to make sure that women are free to receive abortion information in this country and the right to travel abroad, which was not guaranteed by the court decision. The liberals note that 4,000 Irishwomen a year go to Britain for abortions. The debate has become entangled in the referendum on June 18 on the Treaty on European Union, which has an abortion protocol that could bring changes in Irish law. The Government is gambling that the abortion dispute will not bring about defeat of the treaty, which it strongly favors, and has promised to deal with the question of legal abortions in a referendum and with new legislation in November. Europe's Highest Birth Rate The debate is taking place in a country of 3.5 million where, more so than in most of Europe, women stay in the home as childbearers. The birth rate is declining, but is still the highest in Europe. Only 30 percent of married Irishwomen have jobs outside the home, but the number is rising as the economy falters. But in recent years, despite Catholic teaching, married couples are using contraceptives. At the same time, out-of-wedlock births have risen from 1 in 60 births about 10 years ago to 1 in 10 today. ""We're all pro-life,"" Mrs. Casey said, ""but there have to be exceptions. It's not opening the floodgates like England or America. We have a different culture here. I don't know how you deal with limited abortion, but the life of the mother has to be taken into consideration. Legalize it in some situations, but not so it could be used as a contraceptive."" Mrs. Killeen said: ""It's wrong for me, but why should I legislate for anybody else, who may be desperate? Half of these women wouldn't go if they had proper information and counseling. If they weren't so lonely."" The women, all regular churchgoers, said the priests had not been haranguing them on abortion from the pulpit. ""I definitely think the church has lost it on contraception, on divorce, on abortion,"" Mrs. Casey said. Florence Fitzmaurice said of hard-line anti-abortion groups, ""The way they talk they don't love God at all."" Mrs. Casey said of the hard-liners: ""The church is delighted with them.  They're doing all the work and taking all the flak."" She said the resignation of Bishop Eamonn Casey of Galway, amid charges that he fathered a child, was an indication that church practices and policies needed change, in this case reconsideration of the rule of celibacy for clergy. Some critics of the church, including Government officials and priests, say the Casey situation has weakened the church's image as a moral authority. Changing Attitudes Mrs. Fitzgerald, 41 years old, who has a degree in social work from the London School of Economics, is considered too liberal by the conservatives and too conservative by the liberals. ""I'm pro-life,"" she said. ""I have three boys."" The Irish families are changing, she said, using contraceptives, which are readily available to adults, but are illegal for sale to people younger than 18. ""Now there is family planning and smaller families are the norm,"" she said. She said she was a churchgoing Catholic, and added, ""I don't think the church has changed."" ""But women's attitudes are changing,"" she said. ""We are demanding more from our church. But the church is very powerful and many Irishwomen are very devout. There is an unconscious redefinition going on, of the relationship between women and the church, but women are not losing the relationship with the church.""",1992,"Ireland"
"348","THE WORLD; Sweden Redefines Sexual Revolution","West","These days, foreign journalists come to Katarina Lindahl's office searching for sin. ""There was a man here not long ago from Holland, writing about Sweden and sex,"" said Ms. Lindahl, who is the executive director of the Swedish Association for Sex Education. ""He said he couldn't find it himself, so he asked me for help. I had to tell him, things aren't like they used to be."" From the 1950's through the early 1970's, Sweden was synonymous with the idea of an unfettered and open sexuality, a permissive, even promiscuous, society at the cutting edge of the sexual revolution. In Stockholm, there were clubs with live sex acts that drew tour groups from Asia and America. In the cinema, there were films like ""I am Curious (Yellow),"" a 1969 movie that candidly explored the sexual and political awakening of a young woman, and provoked the wrath of censors in the United States. But over the last decade, Sweden, like the rest of the world, has taken a wide turn toward the right. AIDS is part of the reason, but so is a kind of broader public revulsion against excesses of the past. During the 1980's, new laws were adopted barring live sex shows and sharply restricting the profusion of pornography. The new legislation was a result, in part, of the vigilance of women's groups; they had begun to argue, with growing vehemence, that pornography was exploiting women and children rather than liberating people's sexuality, as some had once thought it would. The climate is now marked by greater personal and public rectitude. Some here describe the trend as Sweden's ""white wave,"" or a growing emphasis on morality and ethics, that has given a different cast to national politics. For example, the new conservative coalition voted into power in Sweden last year includes the Christian Democrats, a splinter party with an aggressive pro-family, pro-religion agenda. In the national elections last fall, it won 7.1 percent of the national vote, more than twice the total it received in 1988. Shop Windows Change The sex clubs are gone, replaced by shops selling shoes and clothing.  On the back pages of the city's tabloid newspapers, the only sex a foreign tourist will find advertised these days is in the form of telephone services, in which callers pay for sexually explicit conversations. Even so, some beyond Sweden still speak of the Swedes with a nudge and wink, the way the Victorians used to titter about the French. In Germany, the phrase ""Schwedenfilm"" is interpreted, quite literally, to mean a pornographic movie, and in the United States, advertising copywriters cannot resist the lure of Sweden as an instantly recognizable metaphor for sexual abandon. In the 1960's, a cosmetics company used a wide-eyed former Miss Sweden to sell shaving cream (""Take it off, take it all off,"" she murmured seductively, as a man shaved). Now, the Stroh Brewery Company has risked the ire of American feminists by inventing what it calls, tongue-in-cheek, the ""Swedish bikini team"" -- several blonde women who appear in television commercials wearing skimpy blue bathing suits, to market Old Milwaukee Beer. By now, the Swedes are used to such mindlessness. Nils Petter Sundgren, a Swedish film critic, says the notion that Sweden is some kind of fools' paradise for the promiscuous was celebrated as long ago as 1963, in an Italian film called ""The Devil,"" or ""Amore in Stockholm."" It told the story of a businessman from a small town in Italy who eagerly travels to Sweden, anticipating sexual encounters of the blonde kind. ""It is the perfect metaphor for Sweden: A foreigner arrives dreaming of sexual adventures but finds the girls he is meeting are really quite private or innocent,"" said Mr. Sundgren. ""I still meet foreigners just like that, who come here expecting that sex and women will be readily available. They usually go away disappointed. There is much more sin in New York or London."" Candor Survives In part, the image of Sweden as a bastion of free love and sexual abandon endures as a memory of the 1960's, a period of open sexual experimentation that was a precursor to the sexual revolution in the United States in the late 60's and early 70's. ""It was a time of radical politics, a time when people believed quite wholly in the idea of personal freedom,"" said Ms. Lindahl. ""Women too joined the debate, saying it was important to be open because there was nothing to be ashamed about. The argument was that people should see what they want and do what they want."" But while Ms. Lindahl says that the excesses of the 1960's did provoke a sharp reaction, and stricter limits on what could be shown or sold, the ensuing debate also served to illustrate what many say is another, perhaps more enduring, truth about Sweden: Swedes remain willing to openly discuss sex and sexuality without the shame, guilt or religious self-consciousness that so often clouds the discussion in the United States or other parts of Europe. There is little stigma attached here to cohabitation outside marriage, and nearly half of all births in Sweden last year involved children born to mothers who were not married. In part, Sweden's comfort in dealing with such matters underscores the dynamic of a relatively small, homogeneous and secular society, which lends itself to a kind of intimacy and tolerance impossible in larger, multicultural societies. At the same time, there is a long tradition of public awareness about sex. Compulsory sex education has been a fixture in Swedish schools for nearly 60 years, and some educators say this openness about sex pays dividends: There is a decreasing rate of both abortions and teen-age pregnancies. ""I think it is appropriate for other countries to think of Sweden as a nation that is open about sex, but they often misinterpret what that means,"" said Ms. Lindahl. ""It is not about taking your clothes off in front of cameras, or blonde women in beer commercials. It is something else: It is a question of openness among people, of what we are willing to discuss among ourselves and our children about sex.""",1992,"Sweden"
"349","ANTI-WOMAN BIAS MAY BRING ASYLUM","West","Canada has announced that it will consider granting refugee status to women who are persecuted because of their sex. In connection with what is seen here as a landmark change in Canada's immigration rules, the Government said on Friday that it had given permission for a Saudi woman to remain in Canada after she said she would be in grave danger if she returned to Saudi Arabia because of her views on the status of women there. The woman told immigration officials that she had tried to go without a veil in Saudi Arabia, to travel alone and to pursue a university education in a field of her choice, but was threatened with punishment if she persisted, her lawyer said. The woman's name has not been published. Her lawyer asked that she not be identified because of fears of reprisal against her parents, who are still in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Sees No Danger A spokesman for the Saudi Embassy in Ottawa said he did not think it was ""dangerous"" for the woman to live in Saudi Arabia, adding that not all Saudi women wear veils. The woman did not respond to a request for an interview. But she told The Canadian Press that she was ""excited and happy and relieved"" at the decision. She also said she was happy that Canada was looking at the whole issue of refugee women. The Immigration and Refugee Board had turned down her first request for asylum, and she has been in hiding in Montreal for 21 months. The changes in refugee standards, announced by Bernard Valcourt, the Minister for Education and Immigration, were also welcomed by feminists and human-rights groups, which have sought such action for years. ""Canada may be leading the world in finally realizing that women suffer violations on the basis of their sex and that the well-founded fear of those violations constitutes grounds for asylum,"" said Dorothy Q. Thomas, director of the Women's Rights Project of Human Rights Watch in Washington. Janice Stein, a political science professor and specialist on the Middle East at the University of Toronto, said the implications were ""staggering."" ""If taken literally, the decision could mean that any woman who leaves Saudi Arabia is a potential refugee,"" she said. Many other Islamic countries impose the kind of restrictions on women that Saudi Arabia does. Precedent on Homosexuals Ed Broadbent, president of the International Center for Human Rights and Democratic Development in Montreal, called Canada's action ""a clear move in the right direction,"" adding, ""There is no turning back on the principle that our refugee policy must recognize the full equality of men and women."" A year ago Canada broke ground with a similar action regarding homosexuals: A gay man fearing persecution in his homeland, Argentina, because of his sexual preference was granted asylum. United States law lays out categories under which people suffering well-founded fears of persecution may be admitted. But sex is not a category. The tendency has been to admit women on the traditional basis of persecution for their political views. European nations do not recognize sex-based persecution as grounds for asylum. In a case last year, for example, France rejected a petition from a woman from Mali who fled her family and country rather than undergo a clitoridectomy, the removal of the clitoris and inner labia, which is a widespread ritual. The Government finally gave her a residence permit but declined to recognize that she was being persecuted on the basis of her sex. Broadening the Term 'Refugee' In his statement, Mr. Valcourt noted that new guidelines, which are to be developed within a month, would represent ""appropriate responses to the complex and interrelated issues of state-sanctioned abuse abroad, conjugal violence against women and assistance to female refugees in times of world crises."" The Immigration and Refugee Board has reportedly produced a draft recommendation that the word ""refugee"" include women who can demonstrate that their countries do not provide adequate protection from sexual abuse, domestic violence, genital mutilation and other torture. But there is another way to proceed legally, Canadian officials said: to classify women protesting sex-based persecution as a ""particular social group"" under the United Nations Refugee Convention of 1951, which sets general rules for refugees. European and U.N. Guidelines If such new rules were accepted, women who transgress social customs, for example, by refusing arranged marriages, could claim they were part of a particular group that fears persecution. In 1984 the European Parliament determined that women fearing cruel or inhuman treatment as a result of violating social customs should be considered such a group. The next year Canada endorsed a similar resolution of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which indentified ""women asylum-seekers who face harsh or inhumane treatment due to their having transgressed the social mores of the society in which they live"" as a ""particular social group.""",1993,"Canada"
"350","THE WORLD; How Women Moved Up in Canada","West","A BARRIER fell in North America last week when Canada's governing Progressive Conservative Party elevated Kim Campbell as its leader and the first woman to become Prime Minister. But in Canada, obstacles to women in politics and society have been tumbling for years. When the Liberal Party leader, Jean Chretien, takes to the hustings for elections likely this fall, he'll be the only man of the three national party leaders. Four years ago, the New Democrats elected Audrey McLaughlin. Accentuating his isolation is Sheila Copps, chosen as the Liberals' first female deputy leader two years ago. ""Campbell is no accident,"" said Glenda Simms, president of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. ""This is part of the outcome of the struggle of our women over many years."" ""In the political process,"" she added jubilantly, ""we are now achieving a critical mass."" While Canadians are generally more culturally conservative than Americans, they are well ahead of the United States in the achievement of feminist goals, in part as a result of Canadian traditions of social welfare and a stronger union movement. Canadian women incorporated an equal rights amendment into their constitution in 1982. The sort of vehement opposition from the religious right and other groups that killed the E.R.A. in the United States never materialized in Canada. A Canadian maternity-leave statute has been on the books since 1972, allowing 17 weeks off, 15 of them paid through unemployment insurance. In the United States, it was only this year, under the new Democratic Administration, that Congress gave workers the right to take unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks. Women have 13.5 percent of the seats in the House of Commons, relatively low by the standards of northern Europe but well above the 8.5 percent of seats held by women in the United States Congress. A strong and committed women's movement is leading the Canadian rights charge. There are rape-crisis centers, interval houses for battered women, immigrant women's working groups. All major universities finance women's studies programs. ""I am not so sure the women's movement in the U.S. is as strong or united as in Canada,"" says Kay Armatage, professor of women's studies at the University of Toronto. ""You don't have the political extremes here, or the fragmentation."" Not only is the religious right less active; there is less anti-feminist backlash. Lacking the individualistic bent of their southern neighbors, Canadians take more to quiet collective action. The main women's organization, the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, has 500 member groups representing 3 million Canadian women. Canada's total population is only 27 million. Thirty percent of the committee's $1 million annual budget comes from the Government. In contrast, the National Organization of Women, the largest women's rights organization in the United States, gets no Federal money. The Canadian organization has evolved dramatically over the past two decades. It used to be an exclusively white, middle-class network of professional women. Now a third of its members are from minorities or native groups. Native women seeking greater rights on reservations, strongholds of male domination, are among the more vocal members. The organization's new president is a 35-year-old single mother from Vancouver, Sunera Thobani, who reflects Canada's multicultural character. Born in Tanzania of a family that came from India, she is the first non-white to lead the organization. In both English- and French-speaking Canada, the women's movement gained strength in the 1960's, as in the United States, with an influx of women in the work force, the formation of advocacy groups and wide availability of the pill. A royal commission was set up in 1967 to look into women's needs. This led to the establishment four years later of a Cabinet minister responsible for the status of women.  The involvement of senior levels of government differentiates the movement here from the United States. Canada's feminists won the main tool of their struggle, the equal rights amendment, in the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which says the human rights of the charter are ""guaranteed equally to male and female persons."" It makes specific allowance for affirmative action. Marilou McPhedran, a lawyer who helped draft the amendment, said, ""When a situation arises in any area of government policy or law and we are able to demonstrate an unequal result being borne by women because they are women, then we have the tool of our Constitution to challenge and have our law or policy either struck down or modified."" The Government has put up millions of dollars to help feminists finance court tests of discrimination. One result was a landmark 1988 decision by Canada's Supreme Court declaring unconstitutional criminal penalties against a Quebec doctor for performing abortions at his private clinic in Montreal rather than at a hospital (90 percent of abortions are performed in hospitals and paid for by national health insurance). The judgment left abortion a civil matter of personal choice. Another defining moment was the massacre of 14 women by a gunman in Montreal on Dec. 6, 1989, which resulted in a public outcry and gun control legislation shepherded through Parliament last year by Ms. Campbell as Justice Minister. The killings put intense focus on the issue of violence against women. While ahead of the United States on equal pay, maternity leave and representation, Canadian women lag behind northern Europe. French, Belgian, Italian and Scandinavian women get child care that ""North American women would die for,"" says Doris Anderson, author of ""The Unfinished Revolution: The Status of Women in Twelve Countries,"" which was published last year. Still, hope is high for further change here. Feminist studies show that women in office, regardless of affiliation, tend to be more supportive than men of so-called women's issues like abortion and day care. Polls now even show that women have a better chance than men of winning elections, and in the coming elections Canada's parties are expected to field a record number of women. Ms. Campbell, who describes herself as a feminist, was nevertheless criticized by many in the women's movement when as Justice Minister she walked a fine line between progressive policies and the conservatism of her Tories. Yet even one of the critics, Ms. Thobani of the National Action Committee, called her elevation ""a historic moment for all the women of Canada.""",1993,"Canada"
"351","JAN. 31-FEB. 6: Asylum in Canada; In a Landmark Change, Refugee Status May Be Given to Persecuted Women","West","Last week a young Saudi Arabian woman who had tried to travel alone, drive a car and go without a veil in her native country won asylum in Canada in a landmark change of policy. Canadian immigration officials laughed at the woman when she first requested refugee status 21 months ago, based on her fears of persecution as an outspoken opponent of Saudi discrimination against women. There certainly was nothing in the official guidelines to give her any hope. Two immigration board members, both male, ruled that her treatment was within the law of Saudi Arabia and did not represent persecution. Bowing to human rights groups, women's groups and others, the Canadian Government said it will revise its guidelines and consider granting refugee status to women fleeing state-sanctioned abuses based on gender, including domestic violence. Neither Europe nor the United States recognizes sex-based persecution as a rationale for asylum in and of itself, and Canada, which has a long tradition of humanitarian assistance, may now be leading the world. Still, even Canada may have a long way to go to right an immigration system that many consider sexist. An estimated 80 percent of the world's refugees are women and children. Yet two-thirds of those Canada accepts are male.",1993,"Canada"
"352","OLYMPICS; Muslim Women's Exclusion Is Target of New Campaign","West","Charging that there is growing discrimination against women in sports in a number of Muslim countries, European women's groups have launched a campaign demanding that countries barring women from their Olympic delegations be excluded from participating in the Summer Games in Atlanta in 1996. The groups say sex discrimination is analogous to the racial discrimination that resulted in South Africa's being banned from the Olympic Games between 1964 and 1992. The Olympic charter states that ""any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, sex or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement."" ""What's going on is not acceptable and we must alert the public,"" said Annie Surgier, a nuclear physicist in a French Government agency and one of the organizers of the campaign. ""In Barcelona in 1992, people were celebrating the end of apartheid and the return of South Africa to the Games. But no one was saying anything about the 34 countries that had no women athletes representing them. ""It's shameful that the Olympic organizers went along with this."" The protest movement, which calls itself Atlanta Plus, announced its campaign plans after a meeting at the French Senate on Tuesday night. Organizers said they had already written to the International Olympic Committee and to a number of athletes as well as to Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, who is from Georgia. The Atlanta Plus group includes women's groups from France, Belgium, Germany and Sweden and is now seeking support in Canada and the United States. ""This fight is new and it will be tough,"" said Anne Marie Lizin, Belgium's former minister for European affairs and an Atlanta Plus organizer. ""But nothing will discourage us."" The next stage, the organizers said, was to mobilize sports federations and to pressure the large corporations that are sponsors for the Atlanta Games. At the meeting in the French Senate, speakers said that throughout Europe, politicians and teachers were becoming sensitized to the issue of the growing discrimination against women by Islamic fundamentalists because they see it happening among immigrants at home. At schools in France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, a number of Muslim immigrants in recent years have begun insisting that their daughters not participate in sports. Atlanta Plus members say that Iran is the only country they know of that has explicitly banned women from most sports but that others are doing so quietly, including Pakistan and Kuwait. Chahla Chafiq, an Iranian sociologist, said that in Iran women can participate only in those Olympic sports in which they can wear head-to-toe robes and veils. ""They are just allowed to do archery, equestrian sports and skiing,"" said Chafiq who has recently published the book ""Women and the Return of Islam."" According to the 1992 Olympic yearbook, of the 169 countries that sent athletes to the Barcelona Summer Games, 34 had no female participants. Atlanta Plus members said they were aware that among these 34, some delegations had only half-dozen or even fewer men because they said they lacked talented athletes or funds. ""But others had the funds and clearly barred women,"" said Linda Weil-Curiel, a Paris lawyer, citing Iran, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. In 1992, the largest all-male delegations were Iran with 40, Qatar with 31, Pakistan with 27 and Kuwait with 36. Of the 9,959 athletes listed as participating in the 1992 Summer Games, 2,851 were women. In Algeria, where Islamic fundamentalists are waging an open war against the Government, scores of women's sports teams have been disbanded in the last few years. Fundamentalists strictly interpret the Koranic admonition that women may uncover only their hands and face. Moroccan and Tunisian female athletes have said that social pressures against them are hard to bear. In Algeria, Hassiba Boulmerka was widely celebrated in her country after winning an Olympic gold medal in the 1,500-meter race in 1992. But she and her teammates have said that as they trained on the streets at home, people have also shouted obscenities at them. Boulmerka has also been denounced in several mosques for ""scandalous"" behavior ""not worthy of a Muslim woman."" Asked for its policy on women's equal rights, a spokeswoman for the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, said the committee must uphold the Olympic charter. But Michele Verdier said the participation of women was not in the hands of the committee. ""It's in the hands of the international federations,"" she said.",1995,"France"
"353","Eroticizing Violence","West","To the Editor: Abbe Smith's review of Nadine Strossen's ""Defending Pornography"" (Jan. 22) tried to explore fairly both Ms. Strossen's pro-pornography campaign and the campaign of feminists working to raise consciousness about the documented effects pornography has on women's lives. First, however, Ms. Smith falls into the trap of equating ""anti-pornography"" with ""anti-sex."" In fact, ""anti-porn feminists"" who criticize that $11-billion-a-year industry understand that pornography is a form of propaganda eroticizing violence and degrading the amity and delight of good sex. Second, I doubt most nonlawyer readers would grasp that the ""law"" drafted by Andrea Dworkin and Catharine Mac Kinnon was in fact an ordinance permitting civil -- not criminal -- action toward obtaining relief from pornography's violent effects. This is a vital distinction. Having legal recourse to defend one's civil rights is a far cry from censorship. Third, about Canada's ""anti-pornography law"" (actually, the first definition of pornography based on the harm it causes, as opposed to the old moralism-based one, which nobody but the fundamentalist right wing wants): This new law has not been used to censor lesbian, gay or feminist books. On the contrary, individual Customs officers using the old definition were to blame -- a story exposed by the Toronto Star columnist Michele Landsberg but omitted by Ms. Strossen. Last, a personal note. In her book, Ms. Strossen identifies me as having coined an ""oft-quoted epigram"": ""Pornography is the theory, rape is the practice."" For once, she's correct. But she misleadingly quotes out of context from an essay of mine first published in the 1970's, claiming this manipulated excerpt as evidence that I have ""subsequently repudiated [my] earlier support for censoring pornography."" She just doesn't get it, does she? I have never supported censorship (nor has Ms. Dworkin or Ms. MacKinnon). And that essay urges women not to rely solely on patriarchal law, but also to consider witty, militant actions to discomfit porn sellers and buyers. For the record, I have never repudiated my anti-pornography position, knowing as I do how pornography destroys many women's lives and serves as an instrument of social control over all women. Serious scholarship always cites the most up-to-date source -- in the case of my essay, it would have been from ""The Word of a Woman,"" my recent essay collection, where my prefatory note clearly praises both the Dworkin-MacKinnon strategy and the precedent-setting Canadian legislation. It's sad that a civil libertarian would produce a book so uncivil and so uncomprehending of what might constitute liberty for female human beings. ROBIN MORGAN New York",1995,"Canada"
"354","Immigration Case Exposes Cultural Ignorance","West","To the Editor: Re ""Woman's Plea for Asylum Puts Tribal Ritual on Trial"" (front page, April 15): While you rightly draw attention to Fauziya Kasinga's experience of seeking asylum in the United States, you fail to place this situation in a global context. Female genital mutilation, which is practiced throughout Africa and the Middle East, has a higher profile in the immigration debate in Europe. In 1993 Ingrid Katz, the undersigned, worked in France's Ministry of Women's Rights. France had just outlawed female circumcision and was prosecuting African mothers who allowed the operation to be performed on their daughters on French soil. The legal enforcement bypassed the issue of why this ritual persists and shifted the problem from daughter to mother. We need to learn from the experience of England, France and other countries that receive large numbers of immigrants from countries where the ritual is practiced and formulate rational policies for women seeking asylum.

"355","OUT THERE: TORONTO; Shirts On, Shirts Off","West","Some women have been baring their breasts at a series of public rallies aimed at persuading Canadian society to accept new legal standards on indecency. The demonstrations, which have taken place on Parliament Hill in Ottawa among other places, have resulted in dozens of arrests on indecency charges. The appearance in court of the women who were arrested kicked off additional protests. As in the United States, surveys indicate that most Canadian women do not care to go topless in public, yet feel strongly that their dress code is no business of the state -- and certainly should not prompt penal action. ""The cops are here to arrest us for taking off our shirts,"" said Les Tager of the Montreal Women's Defense Committee. ""Where are they when women are being beaten and raped on the street?"" Denise Reaume, a law professor at the University of Toronto, said that the protesters ""do not want to be bound by the sexual meaning that our society attributes to their breasts, and question why criminal law must be used coercively to support such social conventions."" She called it ""a way of controlling women's bodies."" The public does not back the protesters. A poll by the Angus Reid Group showed that 55 percent of Canadians want women to keep their shirts on. While half of the men surveyed said women should be allowed to go topless, two-thirds of the women opposed it. Although the demonstrations have yet to result in any changes in the country's indecency law, women's groups in recent months have scored advances in other areas, making Canada in some cases among the most progressive countries in women's rights. In February, Canada's Supreme Court found that although the country's anti-pornography law infringes on freedom of expression, it can legitimately be used to suppress materials that harm women. Canada thus became the first country to define obscenity as what hurts women. In June, legislation cleared the House of Commons that makes it more difficult for a man accused of sexual assault to defend himself by saying, ""I thought she meant yes."" The measure defines consent as the ""voluntary"" agreement ""to engage in the sexual activity in question."" Women's groups applauded the measure as a landmark victory. In mid-August, a federal-provincial task force made recommendations to rid the justice system of sexism. It recommended appointing more women as judges and encouraging more judicial education on sex bias and on sexual and domestic assaults. Yet, for women's groups there have also been disappointments. For example, the Supreme Court ruled a year ago that the sexual history of rape victims may be offered as evidence in court at the judge's discretion. In striking down the law shielding rape victims from intrusive questioning, the court also found that evidence that could be relevant to the defense might be excluded. In the debate over breast-baring, one issue is fairness. Why should a man be allowed to take his shirt off on a hot day and a woman not? Feminist groups organized the protests to mark the arrest of Gwen Jacob, a 20-year-old student at the University of Guelph, who doffed her shirt on a sweltering day in July last year as she walked in the small Ontario town. She was charged under the Criminal Code with committing an indecent act, found guilty and fined $75. In July of this year, her petition to appeal the ruling was denied. Ms. Jacob argued that breasts are not sexual organs and that the charge violated Section 15 of Canada's Bill of Rights, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, guaranteeing that individuals are equal under the law.  But Judge Bruce Payne of Ontario Court rejected both arguments, contending, ""Anyone who thinks that the male breast and the female breast are the same is not living in the real world."" Although Canadians generally consider themselves more progressive than Americans on social issues, many here see the United States ahead on this one. ""One of the problems may be that while it's hard to generalize because both countries are so big and diverse, Canadian culture, with its strong Protestant ethic, tends to be more prudish than American,"" Professor Reaume said. She and others think that Canadian courts, as they tackle a spate of cases brought on by the most recent arrests, could be influenced by a ruling by the New York State Court of Appeals in July. The New York judges found that two women who went topless in a Rochester park six years ago were not violating the state's anti-nudity law because that law was intended to apply to lewd behavior, not just exposure. The New York ruling has produced scattered demands for topless bathing zones at some state beaches. Ms. Jacob, who led a group of shirtless women across the Peace Bridge into Buffalo on July 12, said she had chosen that route to ""thank New York for getting rid of this archaic, stupid law."" She added, ""Now it's Canada's turn."" Although there were many male gawkers with video cameras at this summer's rallies, backers of the demonstrations insisted that they had achieved their main goal of raising public awareness. ""People are more conscious of the contradictions -- that it's O.K. for a woman to be bare-breasted in a striptease, but not O.K. for a woman to sit on a park bench and breast-feed her child,"" said Huguette Leger, parliamentary liaison officer for the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, in Ottawa. ""Not too many years ago,"" she reminded a reporter, ""women were arrested in Canada for wearing pants.""",1992,"Canada"
"356","Madrid Journal; Feminism Bursts Out Of Closet, Into Cabinet","West","It would never have happened on General Franco's watch, but in the Spain of today it was hardly shocking for a new-car advertisement to be illustrated by a photograph of a young woman in a short skirt revealing a provocative glimpse of underwear. After all, as far back as the late 1970's, the sale of pornographic material on newsstands was open proof that the dictatorship was over. And even today, the sexual dalliances of the rich and famous still provide the main fodder for gossip magazines with huge readerships. But if the revolt against puritanism was long justified as a celebration of freedom, Cristina Alberdi Alonso, the feminist who is now Spain's Minister of Social Affairs, believes it has gone too far. And, at risk of being accused of censorship, she is determined to call a halt to excesses. Asserting that exploitation of the image of women is one more form of repression, she said the suggestive car advertisement that appeared last November was an example of ""subliminal discriminatory advertising."" And after she threatened legal action, the advertisement was withdrawn. More recently, when a photograph of the belly of a pregnant woman was used to publicize a magazine's imminent rebirth, the Government's Institute of Women protested that it was demeaning to women. This campaign was also canceled. Ms. Alberdi, a 48-year-old Socialist and lawyer, was delighted. As a Cabinet minister, she wants to make her mark, not only by eliminating titillating or offensive advertising, but also, more ambitiously, by setting in motion a second women's revolution in Spain. ""There have been other women ministers, but none from the feminist movement,"" she said. ""This is very important because it means there is willingness to give priority to women's issues. In the Cabinet, we act collectively, but now I can raise how our decisions affect women."" In truth, much has been achieved since the days of Franco, who died in 1975 after 36 years as Spain's absolute ruler. Once brought up to be wives and mothers, women now routinely study, work, go out at night without men as escorts, and take part in politics. Discrimination on the basis of sex is illegal and, today, women represent more than half the country's university students and are more present than ever in public life. ""It's remarkable that such a rapid change in the role of women should have been so easily accepted in a country with a deep tradition of machismo,"" Ms. Alberdi said. But women have still not achieved true equality, she said, ""and that's our objective."" As Minister of Social Affairs, she has identified three areas as priorities -- to give women equal opportunity in the workplace, to gain access for women to positions of responsibility in government and society as a whole, and to combat stereotyping by creating new female role models. At present, two out of three jobs are held by men and, as unemployment has climbed over the last three years, women have been hurt most. Among men, the official jobless rate is 20 percent; among women, it is 30 percent.  The average wage for women is still 30 percent lower than that for men. ""Women should be given an equal chance but also equal treatment,"" said Ms. Alberdi, who as a lawyer specialized in women's issues. ""This relates to the kinds of employment contracts that are being developed as a result of the crisis. For example, part-time work is something that suits women and should not be exclusively for men."" She is also sponsoring ""positive action"" programs in both private business and government with a view to freeing women from their traditional roles as secretaries and personal assistants and promoting them to more senior positions. Women now hold 42 percent of Government jobs, but only 13 percent of top jobs are held by women and these are concentrated in the Ministries of Culture and Social Affairs, which are both headed by women. In politics, Ms. Alberdi said the objective is parity between men and women, but she conceded that this would not be easy. ""Women still resist entering politics because it's difficult to run a home at the same time,"" she said. ""The rules of the game in politics are also still very masculine, and, in order to rise, women have to adjust."" Her favorite campaign, though, involves the image of women. ""We have to change the stereotyped idea of the dependent woman,"" she said. ""We have to create a new image in harmony with reality. On television, the typical woman is still a housewife, but there are lots of new female role models that can be promoted."" She disapproves of the term ""senorita"" to describe unmarried women. And in the absence of a Spanish equivalent of Ms., she said, all women should be addressed as ""senora."" Has she been surprised by the effect she has had as a feminist in government? Apparently not. ""I am just doing what people expected of me,"" she said quietly.",1994,"Spain"

In fact, one of Professor Paxton's Columbia colleagues, the Barnard College historian Rosalind Rosenberg, was a key witness in a 1984 sex discrimination suit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Sears, Roebuck & Company. Professor Rosenberg argued that women have always been motivated by concerns other than economic ones and in the Sears case were underrepresented in high-paying commission jobs on account of their preference for less pressured positions. Alice Kessler-Harris, another feminist historian, countered that women have opted for higher-paying jobs when they became available. The trial, which Sears won, spurred debates among historians about the meaning and obligations of feminist history.

And if a group of men argued that women should have certain rights, but no women were consulted on this and no women would have any knowledge of these supposed rights or choice in exercising them, I wouldn't call them rights.

Women enter the mixed-gender world of politics with a handicap. As girls and young women, they were probably socialized to serve rather than to lead. Moreover, they likely learned early that boys avoid girls who assert themselves, and that personal ambition in females is not ""ladylike."" In contrast, boys who exercised leadership were probably rewarded with admiration from girls and praise from educators and parents. Most of the women who succeed in politics are pushed into it by circumstances -- the death of a spouse or other kin -- or by the encouragement of someone outside their families who recognizes their leadership qualities. Perhaps the new equity system in France will be just what women need to gain the confidence to run. ELISABETH ISRAELS PERRY St. Louis, Feb. 5, 2001",2001,"France"

"363","Doctor in Italy Tries to Ease Pain of an African Tradition","West","Week after week, scarred women came to Dr. Omar Abdulcadir's gynecology clinic here for help, and while the ways in which they suffered differed, the reason was always the same. They were immigrants to Italy who had been subjected back in Africa to a brutal girlhood ritual, common throughout much of the continent, in which part or all of their external genitalia had been sliced off. Dr. Abdulcadir treated their infections or inflammation and then, earlier this month, took an unusual step -- intended, he said, to protect their daughters from the same fate. He publicly proposed that the hospital where he works let him perform a much less severe version of -- or alternative to -- female genital cutting. His goal, he said, was to ease the physical toll of a tradition that was not going away. ""My proposal isn't ideal,"" he said. ""But is there a better answer for how to save the children?"" Health officials in the region of Tuscany are seriously considering that question and have yet to reject his proposal, which he says may prevent immigrants from bringing girls under 10 years old to Africa or to illicit places here for more extreme operations. Opponents have denounced the doctor's proposal, calling it an implicit endorsement of an unacceptable practice. But as an intense debate plays out in Italy, it encompasses more than a medical issue and touches on the same quandary that France confronts in regard to Muslim head scarves and that other European countries face in other ways. How far can, and should, Europeans bend to accommodate so many new immigrants with such a wide variety of cultural traditions? Italians' difficulties in coming up with an answer were reflected in the positions articulated by Cristiana Scoppa, a spokeswoman for the Italian Association for Women in Development, an education and advocacy group. She adamantly opposes Dr. Abdulcadir's proposal. ""It would undermine the fight of hundreds of thousands of women throughout Africa who have said that no form of genital manipulation can be permitted and that it symbolizes a culture that submits women to the control of men,"" she said. But she also said she opposed a bill in the Italian Parliament that would explicitly criminalize genital cutting. She said that more general laws against violence covered the situation and that a law against genital cutting would represent ""a specific attack against a culture."" Marzia Monciatti, a Florence city official, said certain cultural traditions wereat such odds with Italian values that accepting them in any form was impossible. Genital cutting was one example, she said. Marriages of Romanian Gypsy immigrants in their early teens, which also happen here, was another. But she said she sympathized with efforts by some Muslim immigrants to have crucifixes removed from classroom walls. That, too, has been the recent subject of fervent debate in Italy, where an estimated 85 percent of the population is at least nominally Roman Catholic. Public buildings, Ms. Monciatti asserted, ""are places where people with diverse origins, cultures and traditions gather."" That diversity warranted respect, she said. Female genital cutting is practiced in more than two dozen African countries, as well as in countries with immigrants from those places. It has become enough of a concern in Europe that Denmark, Britain and Sweden, for example, have enacted laws that expressly criminalize it. Broader laws in other countries also serve to ban the procedure. Immigrants who want their daughters to submit to it either return briefly to Africa or have the operation done illegally, outside of a licensed medical setting, said Dr. Abdulcadir and other health officials who have studied the issue. Dr. Abdulcadir said he did not know how frequently that was happening in Italy because most of the 500 new patients he saw yearly were grown women whose genitals were cut in Africa at least a decade ago. He treats them for menstrual problems, swelling and chronic infections, among other problems. But he said he did indeed know, from his conversations with those patients, most of whom come from Somalia, that a change in country did not necessarily mean a change of thought. ""Whether they live in Italy or Britain of France or America, they don't want to let go of their traditions,"" he said as he sat in his office on Monday afternoon. ""So I'm trying to give them a way to save that tradition."" He developed his proposed alternative in consultation with immigrants from Somalia, which is also where he was born and reared. Female genital cutting there is widespread, and he said his seven sisters, who now live outside Somalia, were all subjected to it. That alternative, as he described it, would be a piercing of the tip of the clitoris that would draw just a drop or two of blood and would be largely symbolic. He said he would use a topical anesthetic. But whether immigrant women would actually use the procedure, which would probably not violate any law, remains unclear. Several opponents said immigrants who were deeply invested in tradition would probably deem the alternative insufficient, while immigrants who were liberated from that tradition would feel no need for a substitute. Other opponents said his proposal tacitly approved genital cutting. ""We will teach our daughters that this doesn't have to be done and that's that,"" said Ghanu Adam, an immigrant from Somalia, at a recent news conference in Florence. There has been an outpouring of reaction to the doctor's proposal, and the force and range of it partly reflect relatively sudden demographic changes in Italy, whose population of about 57 million includes an estimated 1.5 million legal immigrants and hundreds of thousands of illegal ones. Italians are still absorbing that reality and sifting through the related challenges, both practical and philosophical. A front-page article in the Turin daily La Stampa on Jan. 23 asked why a symbolic alternative to genital cutting would validate that practice any more than the symbolic consumption of the body of Jesus ata Catholic Mass would validate cannibalism. A front-page article in the Rome daily Il Messaggero on Monday mulled the process of cultural integration, concluding that ""to consider people as if they were irredeemable prisoners of their customs"" was its own kind of offense. ""This is all difficult, very difficult,"" said Marisa Nicchi, a regional official in Tuscany, in an interview in Florence on Monday.

"365","When Women Rule","West","Maureen Dowd is off today.  While no woman has been president of the United States -- yet -- the world does have several thousand years' worth of experience with female leaders. And I have to acknowledge it: Their historical record puts men's to shame. A notable share of the great leaders in history have been women: Queen Hatshepsut and Cleopatra of Egypt, Empress Wu Zetian of China, Isabella of Castile, Queen Elizabeth I of England, Catherine the Great of Russia, and Maria Theresa of Austria. Granted, I'm neglecting the likes of Bloody Mary, but it's still true that those women who climbed to power in monarchies had an astonishingly high success rate. Research by political psychologists points to possible explanations. Scholars find that women, compared with men, tend to excel in consensus-building and certain other skills useful in leadership. If so, why have female political leaders been so much less impressive in the democratic era? Margaret Thatcher was a transformative figure, but women have been mediocre prime ministers or presidents in countries like Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines and Indonesia. Often, they haven't even addressed the urgent needs of women in those countries. I have a pet theory about what's going on. In monarchies, women who rose to the top dealt mostly with a narrow elite, so they could prove themselves and get on with governing. But in democracies in the television age, female leaders also have to navigate public prejudices -- and these make democratic politics far more challenging for a woman than for a man. In one common experiment, the ''Goldberg paradigm,'' people are asked to evaluate a particular article or speech, supposedly by a man. Others are asked to evaluate the identical presentation, but from a woman. Typically, in countries all over the world, the very same words are rated higher coming from a man. In particular, one lesson from this research is that promoting their own successes is a helpful strategy for ambitious men. But experiments have demonstrated that when women highlight their accomplishments, that's a turn-off. And women seem even more offended by self-promoting females than men are. This creates a huge challenge for ambitious women in politics or business: If they're self-effacing, people find them unimpressive, but if they talk up their accomplishments, they come across as pushy braggarts. The broader conundrum is that for women, but not for men, there is a tradeoff in qualities associated with top leadership. A woman can be perceived as competent or as likable, but not both. ''It's an uphill struggle, to be judged both a good woman and a good leader,'' said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor who is an expert on women in leadership. Professor Kanter added that a pioneer in a man's world, like Hillary Rodham Clinton, also faces scrutiny on many more dimensions than a man -- witness the public debate about Mrs. Clinton's allegedly ''thick ankles,'' or the headlines last year about cleavage. Clothing and appearance generally matter more for women than for men, research shows. Surprisingly, several studies have found that it's actually a disadvantage for a woman to be physically attractive when applying for a managerial job. Beautiful applicants received lower ratings, apparently because they were subconsciously pegged as stereotypically female and therefore unsuited for a job as a boss. Female leaders face these impossible judgments all over the world. An M.I.T. economist, Esther Duflo, looked at India, which has required female leaders in one-third of village councils since the mid-1990s. Professor Duflo and her colleagues found that by objective standards, the women ran the villages better than men. For example, women constructed and maintained wells better, and took fewer bribes. Yet ordinary villagers themselves judged the women as having done a worse job, and so most women were not re-elected. That seemed to result from simple prejudice. Professor Duflo asked villagers to listen to a speech, identical except that it was given by a man in some cases and by a woman in others. Villagers gave the speech much lower marks when it was given by a woman. Such prejudices can be overridden after voters actually see female leaders in action. While the first ones received dismal evaluations, the second round of female leaders in the villages were rated the same as men. ''Exposure reduces prejudice,'' Professor Duflo suggested. Women have often quipped that they have to be twice as good as men to get anywhere -- but that, fortunately, is not difficult. In fact, it appears that it may be difficult after all. Modern democracies may empower deep prejudices and thus constrain female leaders in ways that ancient monarchies did not.",2008,"United Kingdom"
"366","Sarkozy Says He Supports Bill Banning Full Veils","West","PARIS -- President Nicolas Sarkozy of France told his cabinet on Wednesday that he would put forward a bill in May to ban the wearing of the full veil in public places in France, despite a warning from senior legal authorities that the bill may be unconstitutional. Mr. Sarkozy wants a bill that goes farther than initial proposals, including a ban on wearing the full veil -- the niqab, which leaves only the eyes uncovered, and the burqa, which is almost unknown in France -- from streets, markets and shops, according to his spokesman, Luc Chatel. The full veil ''hurts the dignity of women and is unacceptable in French society,'' Mr. Chatel quoted Mr. Sarkozy as telling the cabinet. The idea of a ban is popular with the French and with his own political party, while Mr. Sarkozy's own standing in the opinion polls has rarely been lower. An earlier proposal from a panel of the National Assembly suggested a bill banning the full veil in public places belonging to the state, like schools and public buildings, and in areas where facial recognition is vital for security reasons: airports, banks and even public transport. Mr. Sarkozy's push for broader restrictions was seen as a challenge to the Council of State, France's top administrative authority, which warned in March that ''a general and absolute ban on the full veil as such can have no incontestable judicial basis'' and that it  could be thrown out by the courts. The council said it would be clearer legally to simply issue an order that women would have to uncover their faces for identity checks as required. A law had to be based on the protection of public order, the council said, not on the grounds of personal dignity. Jean Leonetti, a deputy of the ruling party, said, ''The ban must be total, or it's incomprehensible.'' The prime minister, Francois Fillon, said, ''We're ready to take the legal risks because we think the game is worth the candle.'' Fewer than 2,000 women in France wear a version of the full veil, and many of them are French women who have converted to Islam. The full veil is seen here as a sign of a more fundamentalist Islam, known as Salafism, which the government is trying to undercut. On the left, the veil is seen as repressive and a violation of women's rights, even though many women who wear the veil insist that they are doing it as a free choice and see a ban as a restriction of their liberty. In 2004, France banned the wearing of head scarves in public schools, but at the same time banned all signs of religious affiliation, so the law did not legally at least single out Muslims, as a ban on the full veil would seem to do. Belgium is also preparing to vote on legislation to ban the full veil, with a fine of up to $35 and possible seven-day jail term for offenders who do not have police permission to wear it.",2010,"France"
"367","Lady Macbeth, Where Are You When We Need You?","West","Why aren't there more female leaders? Chrystia Freeland asks in her latest Page Two column. Some reasons, according to two researchers in Canada, are cultural strictures on what comprises appropriate behavior and who makes suitable leaders. Soo Min Toh and Geoffrey Leonardelli, researchers at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, describe ""tight"" cultures and ""loose"" cultures, Chrystia writes. They argue that conformist ""tight"" cultures - with their clear, rigid rules  and harsh sanctions for those who break them - keep women leaders from emerging because traditional notions of leadership are male. Think Japan, Norway, Pakistan and Malaysia, the researchers say. Loose cultures, by contrast, do not have clear norms and are more tolerant of deviation from the rules. Heterogeneous societies and countries in the midst of social and political transition, like Australia, Israel, the Netherlands and Ukraine are loose cultures. These are cultures in which ""societal members tend to be more open to change, and this openness may become manifest in changing expectations and attitudes about the masculinity of leadership."" Chrystia argues that even in loose cultures, it is still up to women to be ""ruthless"" to force change. Pointing out that the researchers found, for instance, that among ""female entrepreneurs in Malaysia, women often have to 'lead as if they were mothers or teachers,' "" Chrystia writes, ""the final frontier for women, even in societies that allow them to lead established institutions, is to be ruthless and to take big risks, essential qualities in world-changing entrepreneurs."" Now, you may be thinking: Norway and Pakistan in the same breath when it comes to women? Norway? With the quotas for female candidates for political office and corporate board seats? Read Chrystia's column to understand. Then come back and tell us if you agree with the researchers' analysis about loose and tight societies. Are there exceptions to their rules? Do you agree with Chrystia that even in loose societies women have not been aggressive enough about taking charge?",2012,"Canada"
"368","When Égalité Meets Gay Marriage","West","In everything but name, France's Parliament system is in the throes of a filibuster. Since Feb. 2, when the Socialist majority in the National Assembly voted to redefine marriage as an agreement between two people of the same or opposite sex, the conservative opposition has filed more than 5,000 amendments, none of which they expect to pass into law, in order to drag out the nation's seemingly ineluctable march to legal recognition of gay marriage. Many of the proposed amendments are meant to outrage: A member of the U.M.P., the neo-Gaullist party leading the resistance, demanded that incestuous and polygamous marriages also be legalized in the name of equal rights. But, of course, the impact of such provocations can only be diluted when so many are launched. During the first weekend of the debate, the transcript of the proceedings, announced Le Monde, weighed in at more than 240,000 words. For all of its excess -- one of the opposition's leaders is Frigide Bardot, the stage name of brash comedian who describes herself, after a pilgrimage to Lourdes, as ''Jesus' press attachée'' -- the debate reflects a deep and abiding moral and ideological divide in France. At the heart of the matter is the meaning of the trio of revolutionary values -- liberty, equality and fraternity -- that France has made its own since 1789. In essence, how are these powerful but abstract rights to be applied when it comes to sexuality and parenting? And nowhere is the complexity and importance of the affair better and more brilliantly expressed than in the debate between two of France's most influential intellectuals: Elisabeth Badinter and Sylviane Agacinski. Both are professional philosophers, both are republicans, both are on the political left, and both are married to towering political figures. Robert Badinter was minister of justice under François Mitterrand, while Agacinski is the wife of Lionel Jospin, who served as a Socialist prime minister. And yet, despite -- or perhaps because of -- these commonalities, Badinter and Agacinski have repeatedly clashed over the character and implications of equality. In particular, they have fiercely disagreed over the role of gender and sex in the republican scheme of things. The two first crossed swords in the 1990s during the debate over ''parité.'' A number of women's groups, exasperated by the persistently small percentage of women in political office, argued for a law imposing sexual parity in political office. Agacinski rallied to the cause: She felt that the Enlightenment conception of equality, abstract and universal, superbly ignored the flesh and blood realities of human existence. Yet it was only ''natural,'' given the revolution's emphasis on ''fraternity,'' that 18th century men believed they were more equal than women. Can one blame them? As Agacinski observed, no matter how much you try to abstract equality from the world, the world -- or, more precisely, our biology -- will always pull you back. Life's fundamental dichotomy is the biological difference between a man and a woman. Rather than pretending that this difference can be transcended, Agacinski insisted on its recognition. Hence the importance of political parity: Only by acknowledging the difference between the sexes could inequitable situations be remedied. The law was passed in 1999, despite the formidable barricade thrown up by Elisabeth Badinter. On the eve of the vote, she published an open letter in which she denounced the anti-republican essence of the proposed law. In fact, essence was the problem: Badinter rejected what amounted to Agacinski's ''essentialist'' claims concerning sexual differences. If France were to mandate political parity, she warned, it would mock revolutionary France's liberating credo, one based on the universal character of human rights. Attributing rights based on difference instead of sameness would reduce the nation to a motley collection of tribes, each pursuing its own instead of the nation's interest. France would become little better than America, where the range of hyphenated citizens would be as varied as the coffees at Starbucks. A decade later, the political context has changed, but the positions staked out by these antagonists are the same. For both women, the struggle is less over gay marriage -- Agacinski has overcome her earlier diffidence on the subject and now supports its legalization -- than over gay adoption and parenting. In a number of books and articles, Agacinski worries that the legal and medical advances that allow homosexual couples to adopt or procreate will unravel society's fabric. The family, she affirms, is yoked to biological filiation. If we truly sought what is most universal in our lives, we could go no further than the fact that ''a child can only issue from a father and mother, that is to say a man and a woman.'' We ignore this ''fundamental value'' only at our own and society's peril, Agacinski warns. Most alarming, in her eyes, is the burgeoning market in surrogate mothers, women engaged in what she calls ''a commerce in human beings.'' Where Agacinski glimpses the end of civilization as we know it, Badinter sees civilization as we should know it. ''I'm fed up with those who label this an economic exchange,'' she says. Desire, not biology, is essential: The family, she contends, is the ''convergence of individual liberty and shared goals.'' It is immaterial whether a couple's child issues directly from the couple or a surrogate mother. If anything is sacred, it is not the womb, but a couple's desire, whether they are infertile or gay, to raise a child. The irony, for Badinter, is that scarcely a generation ago parents were compelled by law to have children they did not want, while parents who do want children today are prevented by law from doing so. The distance from anti-abortion to anti-gay legislation, she suggests, is shorter than we might think. In fact, the distance between these struggles and 1789 is also shorter than it might first appear. Both Agacinski and Badinter, after all, claim their respective positions have universal foundations. For Badinter, our common humanity is founded upon human reason, whereas for Agacinski it issues from the universal character of human nature. It turns out that even universalism is not universal. Badinter lost the first round of her debate with Agacinski when the parity law passed; if public opinion polls on the issue of gay marriage and adoption are reliable, it seems certain Agacinski will lose the second round.

"369","Davos Needs Parents of Both Sexes","West","Reporting from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Nicholas Kristof describes a ""sea of men."" In ""She's (Rarely) the Boss,""he writes that female participation at the ""annual conclave of the presumed powerful"" is 17 percent. No word on how many of those 17 percent are mothers of young children, or how many of the 83 percent of male attendees are fathers who made sure to arrange for suitable child care before they came. Why so few women? Mr. Kristof offers Sheryl Sandberg's ""provocative"" general answer to the question of why women are underrepresented in positions of power from her forthcoming book, ""Lean In"": ""We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in. We internalize the negative messages we get throughout our lives, the messages that say it's wrong to be outspoken, aggressive, more powerful than men. We lower our own expectations of what we can achieve. We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care. We compromise our career goals to make room for partners and children who may not even exist yet."" There is something real and important in what she says, Mr. Kristof argues, citing his experiences of men asking questions more readily, along with a McKinsey survey (36 percent of male employees at major companies aspired to be top executives, compared with 18 percent of the women) and a study of Carnegie Mellon M.B.A. graduates in 2003 (57 percent of the men, but only 7 percent of the women, tried to negotiate a higher initial salary offer). Neither Ms. Sandberg nor Mr. Kristof blames women for the numeric effect of their many failures and compromises, and both give significant weight to history, nature, social mores and the fact that, as Mr. Kristof puts it, ""the modern job was built for the distracted father."" But there is so much more to the story of why women are underrepresented in Davos, in boardrooms and in corporate executive roles. In a complex, forthcoming study from the researchers Serena Chen at the University of California, Berkeley and Melissa Williams of Emory University, women who were asked to imagine a life in which they made most of the household decisions for a family consisting of a small child and a spouse showed less interest in  achieving power in the workplace than women who imagined sharing those household decisions with a spouse, whereas men asked to imagine the same situations showed no change in their workplace ambitions. A (male) writer, considering this data, produced a piece for The Huffington Post with the headline ""Working Moms Study: Household Managers Found to Have Less Ambition at Work"" (The short line in the link? ""working-moms-less-likely-leaders""). The researchers theorized that women were more likely to value household power, and therefore to feel less hypothetically in need of workplace power (unlike The Huffington Post writer, I find it hard to extrapolate from the imagined desires of research subjects to the real world), but the result was still yet another negative headline about women in the workplace. This research seems to support Ms. Sandberg's argument: even women imagining managing a household with a child ""lean back."" But we have to consider the extent to which that household (even the hypothetical household) pushes mothers back. From birth to age 5 or 6, that single child will need someone present to care for her during every one of her waking and sleeping hours. That care has to be provided by a parent or paid for (and the parent who works at home caring for his or her child is ""paying"" for child care in lost earnings elsewhere). Only when she's old enough for public school does society support - in the purely economic sense - the idea that both of that child's parents could work outside the home, and then one parent is expected (again, in the economic sense of a publicly provided alternative to the child being at home with the parent) to be present after 3 p.m. Those are cold, hard economic facts (and please understand that they aren't meant to reflect the very real emotional pleasures and even economic gains of having children). Men, who are accustomed to having women deal most fully with the consequences of that unavoidable requirement, may be more able to see it as less limiting.  The fact that the men in the above hypothetical study weren't daunted by the proposition of being wholly responsible for arranging that care may show an admirable level of ambition, but it may also show a poor grasp of reality. The most salient line in Ms. Sandberg's words was this one: ""We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care."" We - as in, we women - do, and that makes it difficult. But do we women continue to do the majority of the housework and child care because we want to? Because we have to? Because we're expected to? I'm not even sure we know the answer to that question. Regardless, until that greater household burden on women changes, the number of mothers in Davos won't change. Two things could help: more fathers taking on real equal roles in child-rearing, and more structural support, not for women, but for families. Families who need paid sick leave. Families who need paternity and maternity leave. Families who need access to affordable, high-quality day care, and to birth control, and to preventative health care. (And unless you sprang from the brow of Zeus fully formed, those issues affect those without children as well.) All of those are economic issues, and they certainly have an economic impact, in different ways, in different societies, worldwide. Lifting families from poverty requires all of those things. So they'll probably be at least touched on in Davos. But will they be discussed in the same way as if 50 percent of the attendees were women, and if the other 50 percent were men who had always had, and expected to have, a gender-neutral equal role in family life? No.",2013,"Switzerland"
"370","The Rights of French Women","West","The French National Assembly's approval on Jan. 22 of an amendment that frees women seeking an abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy from having to justify their decision is a refreshing step forward for reproductive rights. The bill deletes language from a 1975 law that gave women the right to an abortion within 12 weeks if the pregnancy caused ''distress.'' France's minister for women's rights, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, said that in light of the Spanish government's proposal to severely limit abortion, it was more important than ever for France to reject any presumed moral justification for depriving women of the freedom to manage their own bodies. The amendment is part of a gender-equality bill that is the most comprehensive legislation on women's rights in the history of France. The bill seeks to give women parity with men by improving wages, strengthening laws against domestic violence and providing for equal representation in politics. The bill also encourages fathers to seek parental leave to care for a new baby by offering six additional months of paid leave if taken by the second parent. In addition, it bans beauty pageants for girls under 13 and expands support for single mothers. Companies that do not show progress on workplace equality face monthly fines of up to 1 percent of their wage base. The bill enjoins the media from broadcasting sexist or demeaning images of women. The French Senate passed the bill last September. Women in France earn, on average, 25 percent less than their male counterparts. They make up only 27 percent of the Assembly and 22 percent of the Senate. Only 3 percent of chief executives in France are women. This bill puts France at the forefront of efforts to address persistent discrimination against women. Given threats to women's rights elsewhere in Europe and the world -- including access to legal abortion -- lawmakers' commitment to back pieties about equality with strong legislation is a welcome example of what governments can do to support equal rights and equal opportunities for women.",2014,"France"

"372","French Film Goes Viral, but Not in France","West","PARIS -- The main character is a harried parent just trying to slog through the routine of the day: dropping off the toddler at day care, picking up the mail, running errands. But in ''Oppressed Majority'' (''Majorité Opprimée''), a provocative short film by the French screenwriter and director Eléonore Pourriat, the parent doing the chores is a man, and all the gender roles are reversed, creating a world in which men confront what it would be like to face the daily indignities, compromises and risks that women often face because of their appearance, second-class status in the workplace and gender bias. The 11-minute film was originally released online four years ago to little notice. In February, Ms. Pourriat added English subtitles, and viewership on YouTube took off, attracting nearly 8.5 million hits within less than a month of its release. With the new attention came the conversation about sexism that Ms. Pourriat (pronounced poo-ree-AH) had hoped to provoke when she first released the film. The comments ranged from Twitter messages like ''Watch this film'' or ''Try doubting sexism after watching this video'' to longer discussions on news and feminist sites. The Guardian featured it on its Women's Blog, where it prompted talk about what women should do about everyday sexism. ''What's happened to my film is fantastic,'' Ms. Pourriat said. ''I don't know if it's just the subject or the buzz.'' One question that neither Ms. Pourriat nor French social critics have a clear answer for is why ''Oppressed Majority'' seems to have had so much more resonance outside France. For the first three years that the film was posted in French, it had only about 20,000 views. Now, after widespread attention on mostly English-language social media, that number has reached 700,000, still far less than the 8.96 million views, and counting, of the version with English subtitles. Although several French social critics said that they thought the subject matter was one that French audiences generally were open to, they noted that other films on sexism have done far better here. One explanation offered by French feminists is that the film is uncompromising and fearless in confronting French attitudes toward gender and ethnicity. The film unfolds in a series of brief vignettes that follow a frumpy house husband, named Pierre. They are in part parody: Women jog past him bare-chested. But then the film takes on a menacing turn. The man is accosted and molested by an armed gang of young women. When he goes to the police station, it is almost entirely staffed by women. The female officer hearing his account of the attack interrupts the interview to send her young male assistant for coffee; as he leaves, she comments on how attractive the assistant looks in his new jeans. When Pierre, humiliated at having to describe the attack, finishes explaining how the women accosted him and how one of them bit his penis, the policewoman looks at him skeptically and says: ''It's absurd. Broad daylight, and there were no witnesses?'' At the end, his wife comes to pick him up, but she is late because she's been at a business meeting. ''Oppressed Majority'' is Ms. Pourriat's first short film; she previously worked as a screenwriter and actress, often with her husband, Benoit Cohen, who is also a filmmaker. ''I was raised with the idea that men and women were equal,'' said Ms. Pourriat, 42, who considers the work of the New Zealand director Jane Campion as an inspiration. ''And when I grew up, I saw that they weren't, even if there are laws saying they are. ''When I issued the film in 2010 and said I was a feminist, people would look at me as if there was no point to this, as if it was not the most important thing to fight about and to talk about. In France, nothing was in danger.'' ''Today there's been a debate about gay marriage, about abortion,'' she continued, ''and this makes people more conscious and engaged.'' While the response to the film abroad has been mostly positive, as shown in the comments and the growing number of viewers. The still relatively small number of French viewers and their more skeptical critiques, Ms. Pourriat argues, is another sign of how deeply sexism remains embedded in French society. Many French feminists do see the film as an incisive commentary. Michèle Horlaville, a member of La Barbe, a group that advocates for more women in public life, said in an interview that France was ''a country of male domination,'' adding, ''It is a Latin country, and there's a lot to be done when it comes to gender.'' She said that the movie may have struck people as violent because of its bluntness and its direct ''appeal to conscience,'' forcing men to put themselves in women's shoes. ''The struggle for social rights for women does not always go with the struggle for human rights. We are the country that does not speak of 'human rights' but of 'the rights of man,' '' Ms. Horlaville said. The film has found plenty of critics in France, both male and female. ''The gender inversion was interesting and unusual, but I was not enthusiastic about the movie,'' Eric Fasson, a sociologist in Paris, said by telephone. ''It ridicules men.'' Mr. Fasson said he did not like a scene in which the French couple's babysitter, a Muslim man, is shown dressed as a woman wearing an abbaya and hijab at the request of the babysitter's wife. Mr. Fasson objected to the depiction of Muslim women as subservient. ''It's a cliché about veiled women,'' he said. ''They aren't necessarily submissive and stupid.'' But Ms. Pourriat's point, or one of them, is that gender trumps religious faith and ethnicity. Some women in France disagreed with their male counterparts and said they liked that scene but objected to others. Michèle Fitoussi, a French writer and former columnist for Elle magazine, found fault with the way the man was depicted as ''a victim of everyone.'' ''It's too much,'' she said. Ms. Fitoussi also suggested that although it has become acceptable for women to act like men at work, to be bosses, even to become the president of France, the opposite is not true of men. ''We do not feel comfortable with the idea of a man feminizing himself,'' she said. Beyond the political, Ms. Pourriat said she had a personal motivation for making the film as well: As the mother of a 15-year-old daughter (she also has a 13-year-old son), she said, she is all too aware of the vulnerability of adolescent girls to male peer pressure. ''I can see that in her generation boys try to impose their point of view on girls,'' she said.",2014,"France"
"373","A Fistful Of Hostility Is Found In Women","West","In the old Punch and Judy shows of the last century, Punch would batter Judy under the stage while the audience roared. But now it seems likely that in their private moments together Judy gave Punch back a bit of his own. Researchers studying human aggression are discovering that, in contrast to the usual stereotypes, patterns of aggression among girls and women under some circumstances may mirror or even exaggerate those seen in boys and men. And while women's weapons are often words, fists may be used, too. In a large-scale review of dozens of studies of physical hostility in heterosexual relationships, Dr. John Archer, a psychologist at the University of Central Lancashire in Great Britain, has found that although women sustain more serious and visible injuries than men during domestic disputes, overall they are just as likely as men to resort to physical aggression during an argument with a sexual partner. Dr. Archer compiled interviews with tens of thousands of men and women in Canada, Great Britain, the United States and New Zealand, and discovered that women who argued with their dates or mates were actually even slightly more likely than men to use some form of physical violence, ranging from slapping, kicking and biting, to choking or using a weapon. The pattern was particularly pronounced among younger women and women who were dating a partner rather than married to or living with him, he said. ""Whatever the base rate of physical aggression in the population, women tended to have a slightly higher rate than men,"" Dr. Archer said. In contrast, though, most instances of serious violence in his study were caused by men, as were most injuries that required medical care: Women accounted for 65 to 70 percent of those requiring medical help as a result of violence between partners. Still, ""the large minority of men who got injured is fascinating,"" Dr. Archer said. ""It counters a certain entrenched view of partner violence as being exclusively male to female."" Dr. Archer's study was reported at a meeting of the International Society for Research on Aggression held at Ramapo College in Mahwah, N.J., earlier this month. It is an extraordinary study, said Dr. Anne Campbell, a psychologist at the University of Durham in Great Britain, because it lends support to an emerging theory that women may respond to certain environmental stresses with physically aggressive behaviors that are analogous to men's, although often on a different scale of intensity. For instance, she said, criminologists know that although men are more likely to commit crimes than women, crime rates in the genders are also strongly correlated. In other words, in impoverished, ""high crime"" areas, rates of both violent and nonviolent crimes increase proportionally among men and women. ""Unlike men, though, women tend to view crime as work rather than adventure,"" Dr. Campbell said. For example, women spend more of the proceeds of nonviolent crimes on staples rather than on luxuries. And women often commit violent crimes against other women with the very pragmatic purpose of attracting the protection and financial support of a ""well-resourced"" man. Patterns of domestic homicide also indicate that women are capable of significant violence, although often only as a last resort. Although the vast majority of all murders are committed by men, ""intimate partner"" homicides were split about equally between the sexes until about 20 years ago, said Dr. Daniel Nagin, a public policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. In the last two decades, intimate-partner homicides have declined by about 30 percent. Dr. Nagin noted, however, that the decline has been primarily in rates of women killing men, and correlates strongly with several environmental changes. ""The decline appears to be related to an improved relative economic status of females, and a decline in exposure to violent relationships,"" Dr. Nagin said. This drop also correlates with the availability of alternatives to violence for women: In an ongoing study of domestic homicides in 29 cities in the United States, the availability of resources like shelters for battered women and legal advocacy for them has correlated strongly with lower rates of domestic homicide committed by women. ""The resources for women seem to be saving the men's lives,"" Dr. Nagin said. The experts in human aggression are now aware that even in childhood similarities between male and female aggression are more substantial than is usually recognized. Until about five years ago scientists studying aggression tended to include only direct physical or verbal efforts to injure another person. Then they discovered that great damage can be done to another person so subtly that even the victim is unaware. The badmouthing, gossip and smear campaigns that can demolish an opponent as well as direct verbal or physical assaults are now formally known in psychological circles as ""indirect aggression,"" and their patterns are tracked as carefully as punches and kicks. With indirect aggression factored in, aggression in childhood is no longer primarily a male affair. In a large observational study of ""trajectories of aggression"" in children, Dr. Richard E. Tremblay of the Universite de Montreal has found that physical aggression in both sexes seems to peak around age 2, then decline steadily, although it remains consistently more common in boys. Indirect aggression, however, becomes more prevalent as children grow older and is consistently more common in girls. The effect of external stimuli on these trajectories is still under intensive speculation, but one long-term study suggests that the omnipresent influence of television violence may correlate with overall aggressive behavior in boys and girls in both the short and the long term. In a 20-year study of more than 300 Chicago-area children, led by Dr. L. Rowell Huesmann at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the more violent television a child watched at ages 6 through 8, the more aggressive behavior that child displayed, no matter what the child's sex. And in interviews 15 years later with the grown-up study participants, the correlation between the television viewing habits of childhood and adult behavior patterns persisted, Dr. Huesmann said at the Ramapo College meeting. The more television violence the child watched, the more aggressive the man or woman became. The correlation was especially marked among those children who told researchers that they identified with the characters on the television screen, and thought the events depicted were real. For instance, 16.7 percent of the young women who had been ""high violence"" television viewers as girls reported having punched, beat or choked another adult, in contrast to 3.6 percent of others. Thirty-seven percent of the ""high violence"" viewing women had thrown something at a spouse during an argument, in contrast to 16 percent of the others. ""The evidence is pretty compelling that there is a strong longitudinal effect,"" Dr. Huesmann said.",1998,"United Kingdom"
"374","GAY GAMES; Event Founded to Fight Bias Is Accused of It","West","The Gay Games, founded 16 years ago as a way to bring together through sports competition people who were being excluded from mainstream life, have found themselves on the eve of the fifth ""Gay Olympiad"" in Amsterdam being accused of the very thing they were created to fight: sexual discrimination. From within the Games' ranks, newly vocal sexual minorities -- led by athletes who have changed their sex -- have arisen to denounce what they say is bias against them by tradition-minded Gay Games organizers. The problems are in many ways a result of success. The Games began in San Francisco in 1982 as a purely local event with 1,300 athletes and a budget of $120,000, and they have evolved into perhaps the most visible vehicle for gay pride and identity in the world -- an institution of sport and culture expected to draw 15,000 participants from 64 countries, beginning in full this weekend. But along with growing impact has come a conflict over what the Games are meant to achieve -- what face for gay culture they should present to the world, and how the complications of becoming an institution, from the protection of the event's image to the consciousness of potential legal liabilities, should be managed. Rules about gender are where that conflict plays out. This year, for example, local organizers in the Netherlands have banned mixed-sex couples from competing in the ballroom dance competition -- an event that will also be held at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, as a demonstration sport. The goal, they say, is to present the event as a kind of international showcase for homosexual athletes -- men dancing with men, women with women. What that means, however, is that a lesbian schoolteacher from Brooklyn and her gay male dance partner will not be allowed onto the floor. Gay or not, they are of the opposite sex, and that has been deemed inappropriate. The change that is drawing the most fire and discussion among the gay participants, however, is a rule that affects only a tiny minority: a requirement that athletes who have changed their sex provide, for the first time, proof of what the rules call ""completed gender transition."" Organizers say that concerns over fairness and legal liability have made it imperative that so-called transgender athletes be put into the proper category, especially so that men, with their greater body strength -- whether born or created -- do not compete unfairly, or perhaps even dangerously, against women. A man on the path to becoming a woman, but not there yet, they say, might still have superior physical strength and weight that could prove decisive in an event like power lifting or tennis, or dangerous to opponents in single-sex women's team sports. ""On the soccer field, a 100-pound waif of a girl has the right to participate in a safe environment,"" said Roz Quarto, co-president of the Federation of Gay Games. But while critics of the new policies agree that fairness and safety are important, the central issue, they say, is larger: who is allowed to participate freely in the Games without being challenged about their private lives, and who is not? ""The Gay Games were formed because gay athletes could not compete openly -- how ironic that they are now forcing another group of athletes to go back into the closet or face a barrage of stigmatizing obstacles,"" said Riki Anne Wilchins, the executive director of Gender PAC, a public advocacy coalition for the transgender community, and author of ""Read My Lips: Sexual Subversion and the End of Gender"" (Firebrand Books, 1997). Games officials said that rules about ""gender transition"" were initially proposed by the Federation of Gay Games, the event's governing body, when the Games were last held, in New York in 1994. The idea was ultimately scrapped in favor of a policy that let applicants simply declare their sex with no further questions asked. The re-emergence of the issue -- local officials in the Netherlands, unlike their New York counterparts, decided to implement the federation's more restrictive proposals -- has made the Games an object of attack even from traditional gay rights organizations. ""Where is their sense of fairness and justice -- where does discrimination stop?"" said Sydney Levy, research and advocacy director of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, a San Francisco-based organization. ""Singling out transsexuals means singling out people who vary from the norm and asking a lot of private questions,"" he said. Under the new policies, transsexuals must provide documentation that includes, for example, a letter from a doctor stating that the transgender applicant has undergone hormone treatments for at least two years without interruption, and other proof, through photographs, correspondence or an employer's declaration, that the applicant has lived actively in his or her new sex for at least two years. The dance competition rules on gender, are, if anything, even more exacting. Officials have said that a man may legally dance with another man who is dressed as a woman. It is also fine if both are dressed as women. Two women can similarly compete looking like a mixed-sex or same-sex couple so long as both are, beneath their costumes, of the same gender. ""We think it is quite unique in a dance competition to have all same-sex couples -- it will be one of the most interesting things in the Gay Games,"" said Niek van der Spek, the director of operations for Gay Games 5. The Gay Games, which have from their inception been a mix of sport and pageantry, have 29 events this year ranging from hockey to a marathon along the route of the 1928 Amsterdam Olympic Games, plus cultural and arts workshops. And while Games organizers say they expect only about two dozen transgender participants at this year's Games, gay rights officials say there are probably many more like Loren Cameron who were dissuaded from going at all. Mr. Cameron, a professional photographer and author who changed sex to male from female, trained for six months preparing for the bodybuilding competition. He said he felt that the gender documentation requirement was intrusive and that he could not in good conscience comply with it. ""Basically they're singling out certain people -- they're not asking every competitor for proof of gender identity, and I felt that was wrong,"" Mr. Cameron said. ""Isn't it the whole spirit of the Games to celebrate inclusivity out of the 'normal standard?' "" Lee P. Sharmat, the Brooklyn schoolteacher and erstwhile dance competitor, who was on the board of directors for 1994 Gay Games in New York, said that striking the right balance between the role of the Games as a showcase for gay culture and its function as unifying force for gay men and women was hard then, too. The games in New York, she said, were harshly criticized by some who said it had become an event for mainstream society. Ms. Sharmat, even though she disagrees with the policy that is keeping her out of the dance competition, said she thinks that bringing the Games into broad acceptance -- and thus helping break down barriers between homosexuals and heterosexuals -- is important. ""You do want to mainstream it -- the question is, to what extent?"" she said. Ms. Wilchins, the transgender group leader, said the opposite question is more germane: what elements of the mainstream should you avoid taking with you? ""When minorities set up their own structure, they take the best -- and the worst -- of the majority culture with them,"" Ms. Wilchins said. Testing of athletes to determine their actual sex is nothing new to sports. In the 1970's, a battle raged in the courts over whether Dr. Renee Richards, who underwent a sex change to become a woman, could legally compete in the women's division of the United States Open tennis tournament without taking a chromosome test. She won her legal case and did not have to take the test, but lost in the tournament's first round in 1977. In the Olympics, chromosome testing has been required since 1968. Gay Games officials also said that ballroom dancing plays a bigger symbolic role in Europe, where the image of hundreds of dancers, all same-sex pairs, would be a statement that gay men and women had fully, and openly, arrived. Games officials are divided about the gender rules, especially on the dance competition. The tradition of the Games has been to allow wide latitude by local organizers, but officials at the Federation of Gay Games said the time may have come to exercise more centralized control. ""There's a lot of people unhappy about not being able to perform -- heterosexual and homosexual,"" said Scott Mandell, the federation's executive director. ""But they are the host city, and hopefully when we move on to Sydney in 2002 it will be a different story.""",1998,"Netherlands"

And she quite correctly castigates the Vatican for its undue interference in the Italian body politic. But Ms. Volpato's screed against Italy's ''famously patriarchal culture'' has the whiff of hyperbole. Yes, the glass ceiling in ''il bel paese'' needs more full-fledged cracks and fewer hairline fissures. But Silvio Berlusconi's silly flirtations are not the issue. Nor is anti-feminism a national character flaw. Italy's low birthrate -- like Spain's, Japan's and Germany's -- is a choice. The reproductive rights of women in China are well-nigh nonexistent. Women in Saudi Arabia live in a state akin to apartheid. Ironically, in ''The Emancipation of Women in Ancient Rome,'' Roger Vigneron and Jean-Francois Gerkens explain how the Italians of antiquity forged a polity where ''the rule of juridical equality was the duty to be pursued.'' According to the authors, the Romans believed men and women to be inherently equal. Rosario A. Iaconis   Vice Chairman    Italic Institute of America   Mineola, N.Y., Aug. 27, 2009 To the Editor: I am heartened to hear that more and more Italian women are fighting the misogyny and racism that reign in Italy. I am, however, surprised that Chiara Volpato  cites a petition addressed to ''the first ladies'' of countries participating in the G-8 as evidence of resistance to the status quo. Was the petition also sent to Angela Merkel's husband? Why was it not addressed to the men and women who head the G-8 states? Ms.  Volpato is right to suggest that the Catholic Church bears a huge responsibility for the condition of women and minorities in Italy, but the Italian left and Italian feminists are not immune from blame. Unless the Italian left takes on these matters with the necessary conviction and sophistication, misogyny, homophobia and racism will surely outlive Silvio Berlusconi.

"377","Burqa Furor Scrambles the Political Debate in France","West","It is a measure of France's confusion about Islam and its own Muslim citizens that in the political furor here over ''banning the burqa,'' as the argument goes, the garment at issue is not really the burqa at all, but the niqab. A burqa is the all-enveloping cloak, often blue, with a woven grill over the eyes, that many Afghan women wear, and it is almost never seen in France. The niqab, often black, leaves the eyes uncovered. Still, a movement against it that started with a Communist mayor near Lyon has gotten traction within France's ruling center-right party, which claims to be defending French values, and among many on the left, who say they are defending women's rights. A parliamentary commission will soon meet to investigate whether to ban the burqa -- in other words, any cloak that covers most of the face. The debate is indicative of the deep ambivalence about social customs among even a small minority of France's Muslim citizens, and of the signal fear that France's principles of citizens' rights, equality and secularism are being undermined. French discomfort with organized religion, dating from the 1789 revolution and the disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church, is aggravated by these foreign customs, which are associated in the Western mind with repression of women. Andre Gerin, a Communist Party legislator and mayor of Venissieux, a Lyon suburb with many Muslims from North Africa, began the affair in late June by initiating a motion, signed by 57 other legislators, calling for the parliamentary commission. ''The burqa is the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Gerin said. ''Islamism really threatens us.'' In a letter to the government, he wrote: ''It is time to take a stand on this issue that concerns thousands of citizens who are worried to see imprisoned, totally veiled women.'' A few days later, President Nicolas Sarkozy said that ''the burqa is not welcome on the territory of the French Republic.'' He did not say how it would be made unwelcome, however, or whether he intended to extend existing laws that already ban head scarves or any other religious symbol from public schools. For Mr. Sarkozy, who defends participation in the Afghan war as a matter of women's rights, ''the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem,'' he said. ''It is a problem of liberty and the dignity of women. It is a sign of servitude and degradation.'' There is a strong suspicion that Mr. Sarkozy, who has supported religious freedom, is playing politics in a time of economic unhappiness and social anxiety. But he also seems to want to restrict more radical and puritanical forms of Islam from gaining further hold here. The French press has been full of heated opinion pieces, charts about different Islamic veils, stories about public swimming pools and the burqini, an Islamic swimsuit that covers the body and the hair (but not the face). Women wearing the niqab, many of them French converts to Islam, have said that they have freely chosen to cover themselves after marriage. Others say solemnly that to stigmatize or ban the veil would only cause more women to wear it, out of protest. Last year, Faiza Silmi, now 33, was denied French citizenship in part for wearing the niqab, bringing a legal judgment about personal dress into the home. In an interview with Le Monde, Ms. Silmi said that she chose to wear the niqab after her marriage, even if her own mother thought it was ''a little too much.'' ''Don't believe for a moment that I am submissive to my husband!'' she said. ''I'm the one who takes care of the documents and the money.'' Passions have been so high that when domestic intelligence issued a report saying that only 367 women in France wore a full veil, it seemed to make no difference. For many French Muslims, the entire discussion is an embarrassment and an incitement to racial and religious hatred. M'hammed Henniche is the secretary for the private Union of Muslim Associations of Seine-Saint-Denis. He is French first of all, he said, and he is appalled. ''There's nothing but confusion,'' he said. ''What they're talking about is the niqab, but I think choosing to use burqa instead is not an accident. They chose a word that is associated with Afghanistan, and that spreads a negative, scary image. ''There are laws in France that force women to show their face, in certain situations, at the town hall, at the bank,'' Mr. Henniche added. ''Women who wear niqab take it off when they must. But in the streets, everyone is free. They're spinning this story in order to stigmatize a community.'' Even existing laws are misunderstood, he said, with a woman  refused entry to a bank because employees thought a head scarf was illegal. ''It's a dangerous slip, going from a ban in school to a ban in the streets,'' he said. John R. Bowen, who wrote ''Why the French Don't Like Headscarves: Islam, the State and Public Space,'' has been asked to testify by the parliamentary commission. ''French political discourse is internally conflicted,'' said Mr. Bowen, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. There is confusion about different kinds of public space, he said -- the street, and places that belong to the state but are not freely open to the public, like schools. France took from Rousseau the principle that no intermediate group or affiliation should stand between the citizen and the state, which represents the general interest, Mr. Bowen said. But Rousseau also championed the right to form private associations, or clubs.  It was not until 1901, however, that the state allowed some unions or associations, Mr. Bowen said, and not until 1981 that foreigners could form them. Muslim groups then started religious tutoring, seen as promoting Islam, and clubs based on ethnicity or religion are viewed with great suspicion, Mr. Bowen said. ''There is a sense that people who are publicly displaying their religious or ethnic characteristics are a slap in the face of French applied political theory.'' Mr. Bowen does not think there will be a law banning the niqab. Nor does Yazid Sabeg, Mr. Sarkozy's commissioner for diversity and equal opportunity, who said it would be unenforceable. ''Even if they ban the burqa, it will not stop there,'' Mr. Henniche, of the Muslim group,  said. ''There is a permanent demand for legislating against Muslims. This could go really bad, and I'm scared of it. I feel like they're turning the screws on us.''",2009,"France"
"378","Italian Women Rise Up","West","Chiara Volpato is a professor of social psychology at the University of Milan.  MANY outside Italy seem to assume that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi gets away with his sexist behavior because Italian men condone it and the women at least tolerate it. But this is no longer true. Today there are two Italys: one Italy has soaked up Mr. Berlusconi's ideology either out of self-interest or an inability to resist his enormous powers of persuasion; the other is fighting back. It's about time. Mr. Berlusconi's behavior has been outrageous. When a female student asked him for advice about her financial troubles, he suggested that she marry a man who was rich like his son. (Mr. Berlusconi claimed he was joking.) He has bragged about the beauty of his party's female parliamentary candidates, and raised eyebrows by putting former starlets into the government. He designated a former model with whom he had publicly flirted to be Minister of Equal Opportunities. This spring, his wife accused him of cavorting with young women and declared that she wanted a divorce. Why have Italians put up with all this? Compared to those in other European countries, conservative ideas in Italy die hard, in part because of our famously patriarchal culture but also because of the huge influence of the Roman Catholic Church, whose political and social interference in public affairs seems to have become even stronger since Mr. Berlusconi first became prime minister in 1994. (The church, for example, has threatened to excommunicate doctors who prescribe the abortion pill as well as patients who use it.) Furthermore, Italy's glass ceiling has proved to be more resistant than it is elsewhere in Europe. Italy ranks 67th out of 130 countries considered in a recent report of the World Economic Forum on the Global Gender Gap Index, ranking lower than Uganda, Namibia, Kazakhstan and Sri Lanka. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, just under half of Italy's women have jobs, compared with an average of nearly two out of three. At the same time, Italian men have 80 more minutes of leisure time per day -- the greatest difference in the 18 countries compared. This is probably explained by the additional time that women devote to unpaid work, like cleaning the house. It is no surprise, then, that many Italian women are unwilling to take on an additional burden of raising children. As a result, the country has an extraordinarily low birthrate. The Italian media only exacerbate this bleak reality by presenting a picture of women that is incomprehensible to the rest of Europe. Private TV channels have started to broadcast images of women who are typically lightly dressed and silent beauties serving as decoration while older, fully dressed men are running the show. (It is worth noting here that Mr. Berlusconi owns the leading private television networks.) The impact of years of brainwashing is plain to see: recent research demonstrated that the most popular ambition among female teenagers is to become a velina (basically a showgirl). Young women and girls are consistently taught that their bodies, rather than their abilities and their knowledge, are the key to success. At the same time, the sexism portrayed on TV reinforces chauvinistic ideas among the culturally weakest parts of the population. Researchers who study female body objectification need only look to Italy to witness the sad consequences of this phenomenon. The portrayals of women bring to mind darker moments in our country's past. During Italy's Fascist era in the first half of the 20th century, there was no shortage of derogatory images of people from its colonies in Africa. Women were portrayed as sexual objects and the men as barbarian enemies. In recent years, as immigrants have been flocking to Italy, these kinds of crude stereotypes have been coming back. To give just one example: The leader of the Northern League Party, Umberto Bossi, has called immigrants ''bingo bongos.'' These attitudes in part reflect the feelings of economic and social insecurity that have only deepened over the past decade or so. The responses to this, namely sexism and racism, are just two sides of the same coin. These days, however, there are signs of change. Italians are denouncing Mr. Berlusconi's sexist behavior through various strategies: by bringing their grievances to the European Court of Human Rights and by making a documentary about the objectification of the female body like ''Il Corpo delle Donne'' by Lorella Zanardo. In June shortly before the G-8 meeting in L'Aquila, a small group of Italian academic women, including me, invited the first ladies of the participating countries to boycott the event as a sign of protest. In just a few days, 15,000 women and men signed our petition to get the first ladies to boycott. Obviously, the main aim was not to persuade the first ladies to modify their travel plans, but to speak out against Mr. Berlusconi's sexist behavior. Today those who dissent have a hard time gaining visibility. The aforementioned appeal to the first ladies, for instance, got great attention from the international news media, but not much ink was spilled by national papers on this issue, and radio and television were generally silent. Despite these obstacles, it feels as if Mr. Berlusconi has gone too far, and the recent sexual scandals are chipping away at his popularity. Just look at the polls. Traditionally, women, together with low-income and older people, have been great supporters of Mr. Berlusconi, presumably because they tend to watch his television channels. Although Mr. Berlusconi still enjoyed considerable support at the time of this year's European elections, recent scandals brought his approval ratings to below 50 percent, with a notable drop in approval among women. The willingness to speak up and to mobilize that is spreading among us is well summarized in a letter that an Italian woman recently sent to the newspaper L'Unita: ''I am ready. Just decide: the place, the day and the hour. I am ready to rally.'' But what can Italian women actually do? An important step is to make dissent known, a difficult task considering that true free speech is largely limited to only a few independent newspapers and, importantly, the Internet. We need to start working on a systematic documentation of incidents of discrimination against women. We also need better organization. Existing groups that would be the most naturally engaged in the emerging dissent (like the opposition Democratic Party, which seems distracted by internal fights) have not been sensitive to the many signs from below. Women will need to exert greater pressure on the opposition parties to represent their demands. But first of all, dissenting women (and men) must speak up with greater confidence. Our country, long defined by its old-fashioned attitudes toward women, is finally ready to rally.",2009,"Italy"
"379","France: Senate Passes Bill On Facial Veils","West","The French Senate on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a bill barring women from wearing the full facial veil anywhere in public. If the law is approved by France's constitutional council, it will go into effect next spring and set a range of fines for women, including tourists, who wear the full veil. It also provides criminal penalties for those who force women to wear it. The vote was 246 to 1, with many abstentions from left-wing legislators; the bill passed the lower house in July. Critics say that the measure stigmatizes one sex of one religion, but the law is very popular with the public and proponents say it defends traditional French values like women's rights and secularism.",2010,"France"
"380","When Culture, Power and Sex Collide","West","The recent events swirling about the ex-next-president of France, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, have revived old tropes about how culture affects sex, including sexual violence. Before this scandal, many continued to believe that Americans are still infected by their Puritan past in matters sexuel, while the French are just chauds lapins:  hot rabbits. The supposed difference consisted of not only a heightened sexual activity but an altered set of conventions about where to draw the line between benign sexual interaction and harassment. The French, many believed, drew that line differently. The number of women speaking out in France post-scandal calls into question this easy embrace of relativism. French women, it appears, don't appreciate groping any more than anyone else, at least not unwanted groping. A French journalist, Tristane Banon, who alleged that she was assaulted by Strauss-Kahn in 2002, described him as a ""chimpanzee in rut,"" which draws a much less sympathetic picture than anything to do with rabbits. Still, some continue to hold that the French have a higher level of tolerance for extramarital affairs and a greater respect for a politician's right to privacy. But neither of these factors provide an excuse for harassment and rape. Conventions of workplace interaction do vary by culture. In Latin America and parts of Europe, kissing is the normal mode of greeting, and to refuse a kiss may well appear cold. Kissing co-workers in New York, however, can elicit mixed signals, at least outside of the fashion district. One does need to know the relevant cultural conventions to be able to communicate with effective ease. In other words, one needs to be a cultural relativist to know when one is being hit upon. The more thorny question is whether relativism is relevant to those domains we generally want to put in the non-benign category: harassment, sexual coercion, even sexual violence. Could it be that offensiveness is relative to the perspective of the recipient, based on her own cultural sensibilities? More troubling, could it be that our very experience of an encounter might be significantly affected by our background, upbringing, culture, ethnicity, in short, by what Michel Foucault called our discourse? Violent and brutal encounters, even for sado-masochists, are unlikely candidates as culturally relative experiences. But much harassment and even rape is cloudier than this: date rapes, statutory rapes, and many instances of harassment can be subject to multiple interpretations, which has given rise to the new term popular on college campuses - ""gray"" rape. The writer Mary Gaitskill famously argued some years back that the binary categories of rape/not-rape were simply insufficient to classify the thick complexity of her own experience. In this netherworld of ambiguous experiences, can understanding cultural relativism be useful? Feminist theory, some might be surprised to learn, has been exploring this possibility for some years. There is a great deal of work on the realm of fantasy, and desires approached through fantasy, as a means to understand the different ways women can experience varied sexual practices.  Women's sexual responsiveness varies, and feminism has endeavored to honor the variation rather than move too quickly toward moral and political hierarchies of legitimate practice. Fantasies can vary by culture and context, and they operate to create an overlay of meaningfulness on top of actual  experience. The result is that fantasies provide projections of meanings that seem to control the determination of events, affecting the way we narrate and name our experience, and even the sensations we feel.  This suggests a picture of an idea-body encountering another idea-body, with the fantasy projections rather than any physical characteristics of the encounter, controlling the production of experience. Such an approach, however, can lead one to discount experience altogether. Whether workplace pornography is experienced as threatening or a reminder of the sexual power of women is simply relative to one's expectations and prior predilections, some might say. Those who take offense are simply operating with the ""wrong paradigm."" This has the danger of returning us to pre-feminist days when women's own first person reports and interpretations of their experiences were routinely set aside in favor of more ""objective"" analyses given by doctors, psychiatrists, and social scientists, inevitably male. The slide toward a complete relativism on these matters can be halted on two counts. First, there is the question of the physical body. Sex, as Lenin correctly argued, is not akin to having a glass of water. It involves uniquely sensitive parts of the body around which every culture has devised elaborate meanings, from adulation to abomination. The genitals are simply unique in the role they play for reproduction and physical ecstasy, and no discourse can operate as if this is not true. A light touch on the shoulder and a light touch  on the genitals elicit distinct sensations. The body is not infinitely alterable by discourse. Second, there is the question of power. Differences in status and the capacity for economic self-sufficiency - not to mention the capacity for self-regard - compromise the integrity of consent, no matter the culture.  Status differences can occur along the lines of age, class, race, nationality, citizenship and gender (all of which apply to the alleged attempted rape by Strauss-Kahn of an immigrant housekeeper). Power differences alone cannot determine whether something is benign or harmful, but they do signal danger. It cannot be the case that cultural context can render power differences completely meaningless. Obvious power differences in sexual relations  should raise a red flag, no matter which color one's culture uses to signal danger. While cultural conventions on power and sex may vary, the impact of sexual violence does not.  Sexual violations should be universally defined, and universally enforced.

"382","Training Feminism's Next Wave","West","LONDON -- What is the best position to adopt if you are staging a sit-down protest outside Downing Street and do not want to be dragged away by the police? How can you make your body so cumbersome that security guards will find it hard to remove you? What are your legal rights if you form a human chain stopping the traffic? The Suffragette Summer School, a two-day feminist training camp taking place in Britain in mid-September, will provide strategic advice as it instructs participants in the art of nonviolent protest. The camp's promotional material promises to help ''budding Pussy Rioters'' hone headline-grabbing techniques. Weary of more conventional methods of campaigning, its young organizers hope to inspire a new generation of feminists with the same dynamism that saw the original suffragettes chain themselves to railings to secure the vote. ''There are creative ways in which ordinary people can put feminist issues into the mainstream agenda,'' Kat Banyard, the founder of UK Feminista, the group organizing the summer school, explains. ''Direct action doesn't have to be illegal. It is really important that people are confident about their legal right to protest.'' There appears to be a real appetite for the course, and about 500 individuals and representatives from small feminist groups around the country are expected when the summer school opens, on the campus of Bristol University, on Sept. 15. Ms. Banyard hopes that this enthusiasm reflects the beginnings of a feminist revival in Britain. ''Until recently, the only time that feminism was mentioned in the press was to remind us all that it was still dead,'' she says. ''But there has been this huge upsurge. No one can deny that it is back.'' She set up UK Feminista three years ago, aiming to encourage the creation of new, energetic grass-roots feminist groups, ready to take action across the country to fight for greater equality between the sexes. Ms. Banyard, 30, who is also the author of ''The Equality Illusion,'' a well-received book outlining how far women are from achieving equality in Britain, estimates that the number of small affiliated groups has tripled to more than 100 in the past two years. Much of the anger that has driven this growth has, she believes, been prompted by the realization that women have been much harder hit by the ailing economy and the government's austerity policies than men. The vast majority of public-sector workers, whose jobs are threatened by government cuts, are women, she points out. ''They also use the services that are being cut more,'' she says. ''They also do the bulk of caring, so when services are being cut back, it is women who have to cushion the blow. Austerity has a specific impact on women. It is, quite frankly, disastrous for women's rights.'' In addition, there are the continuing problems of dismal representation of women in Parliament (where men outnumber women four to one), the enduring gender pay gap (where women working full time earn 16 percent less than men) and the continued scarcity of women in the most senior positions in business and politics. Ms. Banyard is particularly concerned by the ''relentless objectification of women which is the cultural backdrop in the U.K. -- the pornified norm, on mainstream television.'' ''Because of the ease with which people can share pornography on their mobile phones, it has never been easier to access really violent or degrading images of women,'' she says. ''We are being confronted with it more and more -- things like upskirting on mobile phones. ''This all adds up to an urgency. It should be a political priority, but these issues are sidelined and not seen as the disaster that they are. Most people believe in the idea of equality between the sexes; notionally, people support it, but we are a long way from realizing that aspiration.'' The growing interest in a new wave of feminism in Britain is echoed in a recent spate of feminist publications, with books like ''Reclaiming the F Word,'' on contemporary feminism; Caitlin Moran's ''How to be a Woman''; Cordelia Fine's ''Delusions of Gender''; and Natasha Walter's ''Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism'' all doing well. ''From my perspective, the debate has shifted from the perennial 'Where is feminism?' debate to 'What can this resurgent feminism achieve?''' Ms. Banyard says. The summer camp will help women -- and men -- channel their impatience at the slow pace of change into noisy protest. Campaigners are already planning when to put their new skills into action. Politicians should expect some form of yet-to-be-revealed mass feminist action outside the House of Commons in late October. More imminently, Ms. Banyard says, delegates at a European trade gathering for the pornography industry, due to meet for an annual conference at a London hotel, should also be bracing themselves for protest. As well as providing lessons on how to occupy a public space during a protest, the summer camp aims to be an upbeat meeting place for a group of campaigners who still feel resented. ''Feminism can be quite isolating because it is so stigmatized,'' Ms. Banyard says. ''It can be quite hard to tell people you don't know that you're a feminist, because of these persistent stereotypes -- people think feminists are anti-men, are humorless, have to dress in a certain way -- so the very act of coming together can be quite powerful. ''It's a reminder that there is a global movement out there, they are not on their own. They are part of an amazing struggle that is hellbent on bringing about a better world.''

"383","Crisis of Masculinity? It's the Economy, Stupid","West","LONDON - A senior British politician appears to have punctured some thin-skinned male pride with claims in a speech on Thursday that the nation's men are suffering a ""crisis of masculinity"" as a result of the economic downturn. Diane Abbott, the opposition Labour Party's spokeswoman on health issues in the British Parliament, says men have embraced a macho ""Viagra and Jack Daniels"" culture rather than talking openly about their anxieties in a rapidly changing society. ""It's all become a bit like the film 'Fight Club' - the first rule of being a man in modern Britain is that you're not allowed to talk about it,"" she said in a speech delivered to Demos, a public policy think tank. The growth of consumerism and pornography, and the absence of traditional role models, have given rise to a culture of hypermasculinity that exaggerates what are perceived as manly qualities and encourages misogyny and homophobia, according to Ms. Abbott. ""At its worst, it's a celebration of heartlessness; a lack of respect for women's autonomy; and the normalization of homophobia,"" according to remarks released ahead of the speech. ""I fear it's often crude individualism dressed up as modern manhood."" Ms. Abbott's comments, previewed on Demos' Web site, brought some swift male reaction, despite her urging critics to listen to the whole speech before passing judgment.

""More involved in bringing up their children. More genuinely supportive of their partners. More willing to discuss their fears with those closest to them."" Glen Poole, in the left-leaning Guardian, said Ms. Abbott's speech was part of a wider attempt by her Labour Party to regain the initiative in a gender debate in which the ruling Conservatives have stereotyped a feckless underclass of absent fathers. Mr. Poole, head of the Helping Men consultancy, said it was undeniable that men and boys faced significant problems. They were more likely than women to commit crime, be homeless, or to commit suicide. But he chastised the Labour spokeswoman for repeating a familiar, negative narrative about disaffected men who were hypermasculine, homophobic, misogynistic and obsessed with pornography. ""Abbott is right to say that there aren't enough men engaged in conversations about manhood, but is it any wonder when modern masculinity is described in such negative terms?""  Mr. Poole said. In online comments, some readers pointed out that unacceptable macho behavior was not a new phenomenon, nor was it confined to Britain.

In a landmark ruling, a High Court judge in London rejected a challenge by the women, Natallie Evans and Lorraine Hadley, to a law that states that embryos must be destroyed unless both parties consent to storage and use. Ms. Evans, 31, and Ms. Hadley, 38, both underwent in-vitro fertilization with their respective partners and have a number of embryos in storage. The couples have now separated, and the men have withdrawn consent for the use of the embryos. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Act states that unless both parties consent to storage and use, the embryos must be destroyed. Justice Nicholas Peter Wall heard testimony in June and July that it was Ms. Evans's last chance to have children of her own because her ovaries were removed after they were found to contain pre-cancerous cells. She met her former partner, Howard Johnston, in 1999, and they lived together until last year when he ended the relationship. She said Mr. Johnston led her to believe that he would never stop her using the embryos. Ms. Hadley was married to her husband, Wayne, until he left her in 2000. When they separated, Mr. Hadley agreed that the embryos should remain in storage, but he later changed his mind. In his decision on Wednesday, Judge Wall expressed his ""considerable sympathy"" for all four people. ""Ms. Evans's case is particularly poignant, and she is most deserving of sympathy,"" he said. But he added, ""I cannot allow my sympathy for Ms. Evans to take precedence over the clear terms"" of the law. ""The act entitles a man in the position of these men to say that he does not want to become the father of a child by a woman from whom he has separated and with whom he now no longer has anything in common apart from the frozen embryos,"" he said.

Moreover, even if the two men had given clear assurances that the embryos could be used regardless of what happened in their relationships, such promises could not override the fertilization act, the judge said. Some 45,000 couples seek in-vitro fertilization in Britain each year, and 27,000 couples receive the treatment, but mostly in the private sector, where it costs more than $4,000 for each cycle of treatment.

"388","World Briefing  Americas: Canada: Report Endorses Muslim Law In Ontario","West","An Ontario government report recommended that Muslims be allowed to use religious laws to settle inheritance and family disputes outside the court system. The report came after an Islamic group, the Canadian Society of Muslims, announced plans to apply Shariah, a legal code based on the Koran, to settle disputes over issues like marriage, divorce and property. The report's recommendation drew sharp criticism from several groups, including the Canadian Council of Muslim Women, which said Shariah contradicts Canadian laws of equality for women. Provincial law already gives religious authorities limited powers to arbitrate civil matters, but plans to extend those rights to include Shariah have stirred bitter debate. The report, prepared by Marion Boyd, a former Ontario attorney general and a feminist activist, also recommends safeguards to ensure that neither party in a Shariah arbitration is subject to domestic violence and that there be ample opportunities to appeal decisions.

"389","Muslim Women in Europe Claim Rights and Keep Faith","West","Hanife Karakus, the soft-spoken daughter of Turkish immigrants, is a thoroughly European Muslim. She covers her hair with a scarf, but she also has a law degree and married the man of her choice. Matchmakers exerted no pressure. The couple met on the Internet. Perhaps even more telling, Mrs. Karakus this year became the first woman to lead one of France's 25 regional Islamic councils. ''At first, the men didn't speak to me,'' she said. ''They were uncomfortable. They didn't know how to work with a woman.'' Mrs. Karakus, 24, does not call herself a feminist; she simply says she is a French lawyer. But she qualifies as part of a quiet revolution spreading among young European Muslim women, a generation that claims the same rights as its Western counterparts, without renouncing Islamic values. For many, the key difference is education, an option often denied their poor, immigrant mothers and grandmothers. These young women are studying law, medicine and anthropology, and now form a majority in many Islamic studies courses, traditionally the world of men. They are getting jobs in social work, business and media, and are more prone to use their new independence to divorce. Also, French, English, German or Dutch may be their native languages. ''We are not fully accepted in France, but we are beginning to be everywhere,'' said Sihem Habchi, 30, who was born in Algeria, grew up in France and works as a multimedia consultant. Unlike their homebound elders, these emancipated Muslim women use the Internet and spend hours in proliferating Islamic chat rooms. Web sites are now favorite trysting places, a chance for risk-free ''halal dating,'' that is, interacting with men in a way that violates no social or religious codes. In the crowded immigrant suburbs ringing Paris, the scene of recent riots mostly led by young Muslim men, high school teachers say girls are the most motivated students because they have the most to gain. In interviews in France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, young women repeated this belief like a mantra: studying offers an escape from the oppressive housing projects, from controlling young Muslim radicals and from strict social codes enforced by fathers and brothers. ''We all understood that education was our passport to freedom,'' said Soria Makti, 30, the daughter of an Algerian factory worker, who left her Marseille housing project and is a museum curator in the city. The emancipation of Muslim women, like that of Western women before them, is often slow and sometimes deeply painful when women feel they must break with their families. But nowhere is this quiet new form of Islamic feminism more evident than in the realm of religion, the centuries-old domain of men. Young women are increasingly engaging in Islamic studies, a fast-growing field across Europe that offers a blend of theology, Koranic law, ethics and Arabic. Diplomas from the two-year courses allow women to teach in mosques and in Islamic schools, or to act as religious advisers. ''This is a big shift,'' said Amel Boubekeur, a social scientist at Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, who is writing her doctoral thesis on Europe's ''new Islamic elites.'' ''Instead of having to be passive, women now become teachers,'' she said. ''It used to be taboo for women to recite the Koran.'' But now, she added, ''It offers them a new prestige, new jobs and, not least, it gives them a stronger voice in dealing with their parents, brothers and husbands.'' In fact, Ms. Boubekeur said, women found religious texts more effective than secular arguments. Today, Islamic studies courses, often taken on weekends and accessible to secondary school graduates, are expanding in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. In the six institutes for Islamic studies in France, almost 60 percent of this year's nearly 1,000 students are women. La Grande Mosquee in Paris, a large white and green compound from the 1920's with a finely chiseled minaret and students milling about under arcades, is France's leading religious institution. It has its own theological school, largely financed by Algeria. Abdelkrim Bekri, the director, said that the school started a program in 2002, unavailable elsewhere, to train young women as spiritual counselors for hospitals and prisons, much like the ministry of Christian chaplains. Twenty women had graduated, and others were in training, he said. ''There is a great need here,'' he said. Although women are not allowed to perform the most prestigious ritual of leading the mosque in Friday Prayer, Ms. Boubekeur said women were pushing to have a voice and participate in religious debates. ''What is new is that they want direct access to religion, without depending on the rigid views of the clergy,'' she said. Change can be measured in other small steps. At the Islamic University of Rotterdam, a small group of theology students, most of them speaking Dutch but all tightly veiled, chatted after classes about the need to end the social segregation of men and women. ''In class, we sit anywhere we choose,'' said a student who gave her name only as Aisha. ''In the mosques, we don't want to sit in separate or hidden spaces.'' Ertegul Gokcekuyu, the university registrar, said more than 60 percent of his students were women. ''The motivation of the girls is very remarkable,'' he said. Mrs. Karakus, who heads the Muslim Council in Limoges, has not studied theology, but her tasks, long the work of men, touch on religion as well. She has negotiated with local authorities to obtain plots for Muslim burials at the local cemetery, and has reserved sites for the slaughter of sheep for Eid-el-Kebir, a major Muslim holiday. She also helps to organize courses for imams who arrive with little knowledge of French or French traditions. As educated Muslim women assert themselves, they appear to be forging a strand of Euro-Islam, a hybrid that attempts to reconcile the principles laid out in the Koran with life in a secular, democratic Europe. ''I tell women, 'We can honor the Koran from our perspective and apply it to our experience today,' '' said Dounia Bouzar, an anthropologist who is both Algerian and French. ''We must recover the religious texts and free them from an exclusively male interpretation that belongs to the Middle Ages. Most important right now is that women get into the universities.'' The implications of women flocking to Islamic studies are disturbing to some, who see a potential for them to become radical. Tokia Saifi, a former deputy minister for development who remains one of the few women of Arab descent to reach a high post in the French government, said she worried that many young people studied religion because it was socially acceptable, not because it was an informed choice. ''I see it as a regression,'' she said. ''It means we need less discrimination, more ways to promote integration.'' Such debates are far from the concerns of Muslim girls who are harassed or punished for being too Western. Latifa Ahmed, 25, arrived in the Netherlands from Morocco when she was 8. As she grew up near Amsterdam, her family turned against her because she preferred to be with her Dutch classmates. ''They were bad, they were infidels, I was told,'' she said. ''My parents and my brothers started hitting me.'' Ms. Ahmed, who lived at home until she was 23, said, ''I was going crazy from all the fights and the lies, but I was afraid to run away and lose my family.'' One evening, when she returned from a concert with a Dutch friend, her father yelled, '' 'Let's take a knife and we'll finish with her,' '' she said. ''He didn't kill me, but he put a curse on me. It was very frightening.'' She ran away, and although she lives in another city, she said she was still afraid of her brothers, who had sworn to kill her. She has put herself through college doing odd jobs and does not care about religion. ''I don't feel discriminated here,'' she said. ''Moroccan girls can find work easier than Moroccan boys. Boys have a bad name.'' Changes in the lives of Muslim women in Europe are uneven. Many are still pressed into arranged marriages, while others are finding independence. Change is hard to measure in France, where the law forbids the census to collect data by ethnic origin or religion. But in the Netherlands one telling signal is the rise in divorce among immigrants. According to Dutch government statistics, divorces among Moroccan families have increased by 46 percent since 2000, and among Turkish families by 42 percent in that period, with a majority believed to be instigated by wives. Women are also often at the forefront of liberal tendencies among Muslims, publishing critiques and studies about the obstacles and abuses women face. In Germany, Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer, and Necla Kelek, a Turkish-born sociologist, have recently published books that have been read widely on the oppression of Muslim girls by their own families. Ms. Kelek's book ''The Foreign Bride,'' a best seller, denounces the plight of often illiterate girls, brought from the Turkish countryside ''as modern slaves'' for their husbands and in-laws in Germany. Other women are fighting for change through the law. Mimount Bousakla, whose family is from Morocco, is a member of Parliament in Belgium. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, born in Somalia, is one in the Netherlands. They were reared as Muslims, and have pressed for policies to aid women, including raising the legal age for marriage to protect young ''imported'' brides and imposing tougher sentences on men who kill women to save the honor of their families. In France, a movement called ''Neither Whores nor Doormats,'' begun in 2003, helps many Muslim women who have been abused get services from lawyers, doctors or psychologists. As Muslim women take advantage of democracy and civil liberties in Europe, the question remains whether the impact of an educated minority will be continually blunted by the arrival of often poorly educated young brides from North Africa, Pakistan, Turkey and the Middle East. And as Europe rethinks its faltering integration policies, the place of Muslim women is a new target of scrutiny. Critics, including immigrants themselves, argue that in the name of respecting other cultures, Europeans have allowed the oppression of Muslim women in their midst. Increasingly, women are saying that integration policies have been too male-oriented and must focus more on women. Senay Ozdemir, a Turkish-born Dutch citizen and the editor of Sen, a new glossy magazine aimed at immigrant women, is among those voices. Sen means you in Turkish. ''Obviously women are a key to integration,'' Ms. Ozdemir said. ''If the woman cannot or will not integrate in a new country, it affects the whole family. She will isolate her children.''

"390","France: Full-Face Veil Ban Approved","West","  France's top legal authority, the Constitutional Council, on Thursday approved a law banning full-face veils in public. The council said that the law was constitutional, but that it could not be applied in public places of worship because of the freedom of religion. The decision is the last hurdle for the ban, which has been criticized as stigmatizing Muslim women and violating individual freedom. The law, which will take force next year, sets fines for women who cover their faces in public and criminal penalties for those who force women to wear the full veil. The law is expected to be challenged in the European Court of Justice for violating European human rights law.",2010,"France"
"391","Britain: First Steps on Change For Women Ascending to Throne","West","  Prime Minister David Cameron has taken the first formal step toward a constitutional change that would allow girls and women to ascend to the British throne before their younger brothers. Mr. Cameron told the House of Commons on Wednesday that he had written to the governments of 15 other Commonwealth nations that recognize Queen Elizabeth as head of state urging their acceptance of a change in the succession rules set by the Act of Settlement, adopted in 1701, which stipulates that male children have precedence over their older sisters in succession to the throne. Mr. Cameron also urged that the law be changed to eliminate a prohibition on the accession of any monarch who is married to a Roman Catholic, calling the ban an ''historical anomaly.'' The changes are said to have broad support in the other Commonwealth nations, though some are said to have reservations about opening a discussion out of concern that it might reopen potentially acrimonious debate on whether the monarchy should be abolished.",2011,"United Kingdom"
"392","A Tree Grows in Canada","West","This Friday is Persons Day in Canada, a special day on the country's calendar that commemorates, of all things, a judicial decision. It was on Oct. 18, 1929, that the Privy Council, a court in London that served then as the highest appeals court for Canada, declared women to come within the definition of ''persons'' in Canada's basic law, thus qualifying them for appointment to the national Senate. It was, Beverley McLachlin, the chief justice of Canada, said in a speech earlier this year, ''the beginning of a rights revolution that would transform Canadian society.'' I've wanted to write about Persons Day and the intriguing Persons Case that it celebrates ever since I first heard about it years ago at a conference of Canadian lawyers. Every time Persons Day came around, however, something more pressing, or at least seemingly more directly relevant to the American legal scene, seemed to intervene. But this time, I'll argue here, the Persons Case couldn't be more germane to the current constitutional conversation on this side of the border. In fact, for reasons I'll explain, if the Persons Case didn't exist, those of us who believe in progressive constitutional interpretation might have to invent it. First, a bit of history. The British North America Act, a law from 1867 that served as Canada's constitution, provided for the appointment of ''qualified persons'' to the Senate. In the 1920s, with a growing feminist spirit abroad in the land, women had the temerity to assume that ''qualified persons'' might include them. When Emily Murphy, a leading feminist who was a judge in Alberta, sought an appointment, the prime minister turned her down on the ground that women were not ''persons'' within the meaning of the law. Judge Murphy and four other Alberta women, who were to become known as the Famous Five, formally petitioned the federal government, which then put a question to the Supreme Court of Canada: ''Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the British North America Act include female persons?'' The Supreme Court said no, on grounds that would warm the heart of some current members of the United States Supreme Court. Whether it would be desirable for women to be eligible for senatorial appointment was beside the point, Chief Justice Frank Anglin wrote in his opinion. What mattered was what the drafters of the 1867 statute intended, and the words they wrote had to ''bear today the same construction which the courts would, if then required to pass upon them, have given to them when they were first enacted.'' The five women then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, which as a vestige of empire served until 1949 as Canada's court of last result. There the outcome was different. A newly appointed Lord Chancellor, John Sankey, rejected the originalist approach. It was wrong, he wrote in the 1929 decision, ''to apply rigidly to Canada of today the decisions and the reasons therefor which commended themselves, probably rightly, to those who had to apply the law in different circumstances, in different centuries, to countries in different stages of development.'' Driving the point home, Lord Sankey went on to say: ''The British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits.'' Women, the court concluded, were indeed persons. Soon enough, they were senators as well. The ''living tree'' metaphor languished, underappreciated, for years until 1982, when Canada adopted its modern constitution, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and Canadian judges needed an interpretive methodology. The living tree was there, waiting to be rediscovered and tended. Along the way, the Famous Five women came to be celebrated. Their larger-than-life statues adorn the grounds of Parliament in Ottawa, and for a few years early in the new century, their faces appeared on Canada's $50 bill. Annual prizes are awarded in their names. As for the living tree, it's simply taken for granted, part of Canada's constitutional DNA. Although the original understanding of the 31-year-old Charter's framers wouldn't be hard to reconstruct, no one bothers. It's beside the point. I thought of the Persons Case the other day as I read Justice Antonin Scalia's head-spinning interview in New York magazine. No doubt many readers of this engrossing document, which printed out at 15 pages, couldn't get beyond Justice Scalia's comments about the wily ways of the Devil. I was equally struck by this colloquy between the justice and his interviewer, Jennifer Senior: Question: You've described yourself as a fainthearted originalist. But really, how fainthearted? Answer: I described myself as that a long time ago. I repudiate that. Question: So you're a stouthearted one. Answer: I try to be. I try to be an honest originalist! I will take the bitter with the sweet! What I used ''fainthearted'' in reference to was -- Question: Flogging, right? Answer: Flogging. And what I would say now is, yes, if a state enacted a law permitting flogging, it is immensely stupid, but it is not unconstitutional. A lot of stuff that's stupid is not unconstitutional. For years, Justice Scalia liked to amuse himself and startle listeners by proclaiming that his Constitution wasn't living, but ''dead.'' I heard this myself on several occasions. Recently, he's softened his tone a bit to explain that by ''dead'' he doesn't mean expired but rather ''enduring'' as opposed to ''morphing'' or ''changing.'' No matter. If Justice Scalia's Constitution was a tree, it would be part of a petrified forest. Justice Scalia's mantra is so tired by now that only Justice Anthony M. Kennedy seems willing to offer much in the way of an off-the-bench response. ''You have to recognize that if the framers knew all the specifics of a just society, they would have written them down,'' Justice Kennedy told Jess Bravin of The Wall Street Journal in an appearance earlier this month at the University of California's Washington Center. The Constitution's framers, the justice said, ''used words that appeal over time to our sense of justice and our sense of freedom.'' On the bench, of course, the two clashed recently over the meaning of equality in the context of the Defense of Marriage Act. Justice Kennedy wrote the court's majority opinion in United States v. Windsor, declaring DOMA unconstitutional, while Justice Scalia wrote a stinging dissent. But a day earlier, the two were on the same side, voting with the 5-to-4 majority in Shelby County v. Holder to gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The two decisions make a fascinating pair when viewed through the lens of the originalism debate. The point is that neither was originalist. As for the DOMA decision, ''it does not take a constitutional historian to appreciate that the specific original meaning of due process/liberty and equal protection in both 1791 and 1868 do not support constitutional protection against sexual orientation discrimination in marriage laws, state or federal,'' Professor Dawn Johnsen of Indiana University's Maurer School of Law wrote in an essay published this month by the American Constitution Society (of which she and I are both national board members). The dates refer to the adoption of the Fifth and 14th Amendments. And the Voting Rights Act decision, as Professor Johnsen goes on to point out, was likewise the opposite of originalist, rejecting the court's longstanding deference to the role of Congress in enforcing the 15th Amendment's guarantee of the right to vote. The conjunction of these two decisions was enough to make Professor Johnsen wonder (happily, I should note) whether we might be seeing, as she suggests in her essay's title, ''The Demise of Originalism.'' Will Justice Scalia's personal petrified forest ever come to life? Clearly, for him, the answer is no. But on Persons Day 2013, it's worth celebrating the fact that the constitutional tree is still alive on this side of the border, at least for now.",2013,"Canada"
"393","State Feminists vs. 343 Bastards","West","Berlin -- Feminists across Western Europe are sounding the alarm. Prostitution, they claim, has become today's ''white slavery,'' with ever more women from Bulgaria and Romania, Africa and Asia being forced, tricked or seduced into selling their bodies. But in doing so, these activists are creating a schism in the movement, between those who see prostitution as another form of male oppression and those who see it as a possible means of female empowerment. Much of the debate is centered in Germany, where prostitution is legal. As a result, the German author Alice Schwarzer said, the country has become ''an El Dorado for human traffickers, a paradise for johns from all over the Continent,'' who come in busloads to frequent the new ''mega-brothels'' in Cologne, Munich or Berlin. And, indeed, prostitution is big business here. In bordellos along the borders with France and Poland, countries where prostitution is illegal, groups of visitors are often offered flat-rate packages. Though exact numbers are rare, experts estimate that there are as many as 400,000 prostitutes in Germany, serving more than a million clients and churning out a hefty revenue of 15 billion euros a year. Ms. Schwarzer is a leading proponent of recriminalizing prostitution, a position that puts her at odds with her erstwhile allies on the left. After all, prostitution was legalized under the coalition government of the Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder in 2002. The idea, said the Green Party politician Kerstin Müller, one of the architects of the law, was to give registered sex workers a way to ''get out of the shadows,'' including making them eligible for social security. To Ms. Schwarzer, though, such a system simply locks in place a misogynist power structure: ''Prostitution is not the exception, it is a mass phenomenon.'' Ms. Schwarzer's position is common in other parts of Northern Europe, where a sort of ''state feminism'' has been on the rise for decades. In the name of protecting women, in 1999 Sweden criminalized the hiring of prostitutes, turning the judicial gaze on the johns and away from the women. Such a law works well in a place like Sweden, where the political consensus is to subordinate one's personal needs and desires to the common good. ''In Sweden, there are many more men who consider themselves feminists than anywhere else in the world,'' said the German journalist Thomas Kirchner, a correspondent for the Süddeutsche Zeitung. ''Men have to ask themselves: Do I really want to satisfy my urge, even if that means supporting a system that humiliates and exploits thousands of women? What image of women do I teach my children?'' The Swedish model is being taken up across the Continent: Northern Ireland, Belgium, Finland and Lithuania are all about to follow suit. But Ms. Schwarzer and Sweden represent just one side of the debate. Organizations that represent sex workers have pushed back aggressively. They argue that the women for whom they advocate -- such as the sociology student earning a little extra money in a high-priced escort service, the ex-prostitute who opened up her own business and who claims to love her job -- are a social category that simply does not exist for the feminist prohibition movement, which sees only victims of oppression. Resistance to this new state feminism has nowhere been as vivid as in France, where a new law imposes a fine of 1,500 euros on people caught soliciting a prostitute (they are also required to undergo awareness classes on the dire situation of prostitutes and the dangers of sex work). The French philosopher Elisabeth Badinter declared the proposal ''a declaration of hate toward male sexuality.'' She has made common cause with a growing number of Frenchmen -- as diverse as the novelist Frédéric Beigbeder and the lawyer Richard Malka, who defended Dominique Strauss-Kahn against charges of rape -- who deny that their visiting prostitutes constitutes anything other than a private transaction between consenting adults. A petition called ''343 Bastards'' -- an allusion to a notorious abortion-rights campaign in 1971 of ''343 sluts'' -- stated that ''some of us have gone, go, or will go to prostitutes -- and we are not even ashamed.'' They added, ''everyone should be free to sell their charms, and even to love doing it.'' What this debate obscures is the crucial difference between prostitution in general, which can certainly be about consenting adults doing what they want with their bodies, and human trafficking, which no one should tolerate or provide excuses for. Unfortunately, state feminism, in its desire to make a stand for women, ends up punishing those who are most open about their willingness to pay or be paid for sex, while pushing the evils of human trafficking and forced sex work further underground. Instead of cracking down on the men who frequent prostitutes, the authorities should be focused on the criminal networks that bring in women from Eastern European countries to the European Union. Punishing johns in general is a kind of fundamentalism that doesn't befit a liberation movement. By becoming a state religion, feminism can only lose.

"394","WOMEN VS. BRITISH MEN ONLY PUBS","West","BIRMINGHAM, England For Sheila Capstick, a Yorkshire miner's wife, the last straw was the ''men only'' sign in the clubroom where she liked to play snooker, a form of pocket billiards. For Alexandra McPake, a Birmingham transport worker, it happened when her father died and, as a single woman, she had to ask men friends to invite her to the neighborhood club that her family had used for years. Now Mrs. Capstick, Miss McPake, Mrs. Capstick's sister and her 60-year-old mother have joined with other Englishwomen in a group called Equal Rights in Clubs, Campaign for Action, to campaign for women's admission as members, with equal rights, to working men's clubs, Britain's traditional male preserve. In mid-April more than 100 women picketed the annual conference of delegates to the Club and Institute Union, with which most of the clubs are affiliated, in Blackpool, and they expect to argue a court case in the fall in which they intend to challenge the clubs' nonmembership policy for women. They are also planning another 100-strong picketing demonstration against a Birmingham club in the fall. Britain's Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 ''may have given greater freedom to middle-class women, but it hasn't done a thing for workingclass women,'' said Miss McPake's sister, Caroline Bradford, a Birmingham housewife. ''If we're successful, we could do more to affect the lives of women.'' Founded in the mid-1800's as a way of improving the life and education of the working class, Britain's so-called working men's clubs have become a linchpin of working-class life. The 4,000 clubs, with a total of more than four million members, provide the only social life in many towns, especially in the Midlands and the North of England. ''When we were kids, the highlight of every year was the Christmas party at the club,'' recalled Mrs. Bradford who, like her mother and sister, lives only a few blocks from the club. But at the same time the clubs, more than Parliament or El Vinos, the Fleet Street wine bar in London that won't serve women at the bar, are essentially male preserves. At most of the clubs, only men can be full members. Women, as the wives, widows, sisters or daughters of male members, may receive a ''lady's card,'' but that does not permit them to vote, hold club office or invite guests.  ''The lady's card just lets you buy a drink without your husband being there,'' explained Mrs. Bradford. Some clubs do extend full membership to women. But the Club and Institute Union, the parent organization, does not issue women associate cards, which entitle the holder to visit other clubs, a privilege accorded to male members. One reason, suggested a Birmingham man, was that ''the women would want to go gallivanting.'' And a few clubs refuse to let women even set foot inside, while others make the barroom portion of their buildings off-limits to women. The Club and Institute Union and most women agree that the Sex Discrimination Act apparently has a loophole for private clubs.  Working-class women note that the British Race Relations Act of 1976 prohibits clubs from withholding membership from blacks - although, in actual practice, many clubs frequently discriminate by using a variety of pretexts - but similar legal protection has not been adopted for women. ''The whole attitude in the clubs is still that women are the property of their husbands,'' Mrs. Bradford said. Or, as her husband, Joseph, put it, ''The only right Caroline has to go into the club is as my missus.'' While insisting that the decision on membership is up to a club's members, the general secretary of the institute, Frank Morris, maintained: ''The atmosphere would be entirely different in a club if women members were admitted. The way they conduct themselves might not be acceptable to the men.'' Women might, he suggested, carry on as though they were at a ladies' meeting, ''playing bridge, singing, things like that.'' ''These ladies forget that we were founded as working men's clubs,'' Mr. Morris added. ''It is an inherent trait in British men to enjoy the company of their fellow men. We do like the companionship of women, but in the right place. Men go out to dinner with their wives, for example.'' Attitudes have hardened on both sides since the campaign was begun last summer in Yorkshire and Birmingham. At her husband's club, Mrs.  Capstick distributed ''Snooker for Women'' T-shirts and collected signatures of some members for a petition calling for women's membership in that club, which the club management destroyed. She now plays snooker at another club in the area. The McPakes - Alexandra, Caroline, another sister, who is 16, and their 60-year-old mother - joined some members of a local women's liberation group and members of the Communist Party in picketing their club last August. A female bartender at the club, who telephoned a local radio station to declare her support for the woman, promptly lost her job.  (The club maintains that she left voluntarily.) Soon after, women's annual dues rose from 10 cents to $2.25, an increase for which some members blame the McPake women. Men pay dues of $9 annually. The Blackpool demonstration, where women picketed club delegates to the Club and Institute Union's conference, took the quarrel nationwide. ''It was a complete flop,'' said Mr. Morris. ''They were protesting about something not on the agenda.'' The clubs in previous years had voted against women members by ''a colossal margin,'' he said. The campaign will shift into high gear in the fall, when a Birmingham widow, Mrs. Joyce Bonner, in the first test case, is expected to get a court date in her suit against a club that refused to give her membership. Her lawsuit, being brought in Birmingham County Court against the management of a club to which she belongs, charges that the club refused to give her an associate card that would allow her access to other clubs affiliated with the Club and Institute Union throughout England. Her case is being financed by the Government-funded Equal Opportunities Commission. In addition, a member of Parliament from Birmingham, Jeffery Rooker, is proposing a bill that would make private clubs subject to the Sex Discrimination Act.",1980,"United Kingdom"
"395","France Will Consider A Bill to Fight Sexism","West","The French Government today examined a bill, the first of its kind in Europe, that would alter the nation's century-old law on freedom of the press so as to fight sexism in newspapers, magazines, television, radio, textbooks, public speeches and advertising. The bill will go before the National Assembly in the spring. Under the bill, anyone presenting images deemed to be degrading to women through incitement to discrimination, hatred, violence, insult or defamation could face a prison term of up to one year and fines of up to $44,000. Presenting the bill at the weekly Cabinet meeting today, Women's Rights Minister Yvette Roudy said it was modeled on France's law against racism passed in 1972.

"397","CANADA SEEKS TO END DISCRIMINATION IN JOBS","West","Canada has moved to ban mandatory retirement of civil servants at age 65 in a drive against discrimination. The proposed policy was contained in a report introduced in the House of Commons on Tuesday by Justice Minister John Crosbie. The report also said that homosexuals should be allowed to serve in the armed forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as well as in civilian jobs and that women should be permitted to assume combat duties in the armed forces. The changes are being proposed to conform with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that came into force last April. Section 15 of the Charter affirms the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of race, ethnic origin, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. ''Equality and social justice require that individuals be given a fair chance to make their way in society and that when opportunities are not fairly distributed, positive action be taken to insure that they are,'' Mr, Crosbie said in a speech to the House of Commons. ''This includes eliminating systematic discrimination.'' A Million Could Be Affected According to the Public Service Commission, 11,000 Government employees between the ages of 60 and 64 would be affected by a ban on forced retirement. The Government has 250,000 employees, not counting the armed forces, crown corporations or government-regulated institutions like banks. By Mr. Crosbie's estimate, about a million people coming under Government jurisdiction could have compulsory retirement abolished. The decision is also eventually expected to affect provincial and local governments and is being looked at by private companies. Union officials expressed concern that delayed retirement would leave less room for young people in the job market. The Government said that although mandatory retirement would no longer be permitted as an absolute rule, it would consult with private sector employers and unions before taking specific action. In a report last October, a parliamentary committee proposed amending the Human Rights Act of 1977 so that it could not be used to justify a fixed retirement age. The Government promised this week to look for ways to allow more flexible retirement. Combat Role Stirs Controversy Two other aspects of the report have stirred greater controversy. The Justice Minister said that combat assignments for women in military service would be decided by on an individual basis, consistent with the needs of the armed forces. Deputy Prime Minister Erik Nielsen, who also holds the defense portfolio, has opposed a combat role for women, who make up 8.9 percent of the armed forces. The committee had also urged that the armed forces and the mounted police bring recruitment policies into conformity with amended laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Both organizations had refused to admit homosexuals. The Government said it recognized that this was a difficult issue, but promised to take measures to insure that discrimination against homosexuals was banned in all areas of Government jurisdiction. In other provisions of the report, the Government said that mentally disabled people would be allowed to vote and that all Government buildings would be accessible to wheelchairs by 1995.",1986,"Canada"
"398","BRIDES OF THE REICH","West","MOTHERS IN THE FATHERLAND Women, the Family, and Nazi Politics. By Claudia Koonz. Illustrated. 556 pp. New York: St. Martin's Press. $25. In ''A Sorrow Beyond Dreams,'' written in response to his mother's suicide, Peter Handke tells of her excitement at age 20 following the arrival of Nazi troops in Austria. Suddenly the atmosphere was friendly and festive, and everyday work took on larger meaning. His mother ''became independent,'' ''acquired a presence,'' and for perhaps the only time during her sad existence, ''she actuallly was proud, not of anything in particular, but in general - a state of mind, a newly attained awareness of being alive...'' In ''Mothers in the Fatherland,'' Claudia Koonz, a professor of history at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., provides a more complex view of women's relationships to Nazism, concerning herself both with women leaders and with 'the grassroots...a social world populated by women,'' where 'we began to discover how war and genocide happened by asking who made it happen.'' In an interview conducted in 1981 Gertrud Schlotz Klink, the highest ranking Nazi woman, explained to Mrs. Koonz that 'our job (and we did it well) was to infuse the daily life of all German women -- even in the tiniest villages - with Nazi ideals...We wanted to incorporate all women into the national community (Volksegemeinschaft).'' Mr. Koonz comes to doubt the success of that infusion but frames her study with a forceful assumption: ''Far from being helpless or even innocent, women made possible a murderous state,'' and moreover, they did so ''in the name of concerns they defined as motherly.'' As important background to examining the Nazi ideology of the feminine, Ms. Koonz describes the intense struggles over the ''Woman question'' during the Weimar era; the emergence, especially in Berlin, of the intellectually and sexually assertive ''New Woman,'' the frightened reaction of many men and a general backlash against women's rights, and the conflicts between women's groups advocating militant feminism as opposed to a more gentle, ''womanly'' ideal. The Nazis manipulated both the conflicts and the backlash. ''Women Nazis used the benefits of emancipation to destroy emancipation while men Nazis expoited democracy to demolish democracy.'' For the Nazis, a 'genuine' woman was expected to pay homage to the movement's ''masculine principle,'' for, in the words of one of Hitlers followers, ''Only then will she becme a total woman!'' Here we are reminded of the West German writer Klaus Theweleit's depiction of the fascist male fantasy with its fear and hatred of ''the emotional force and sexual intensity emanating from women.'' Ms. Koonz's pained question -- one that haunts both her book and the entire female Nazi experience -- has to do with how women themselves could embrace these attitudes. Thus a leading woman Nazi declared, ''National socialism is a male concern and we women will gladly retreat just as soon as our Furher does not need us any longer.'' What is at issue here psychologically, I believe, is the capacity of women to render certain fantasies of their own, whatever the extent to which those fantasies are fed by male doctrine. Consider the image of the ''total woman.'' Having encountered it recently in our own society, we are more than a bit chilled to learn of its use by the Nazis. The image in general has to do with women's focus on ostensibly feminine talents in private family spheres while granting public and political hegemony to men. The problem for those of us who find such arrangements abhorrent is that they can hold considerable attraction for large numbers of women and men. For various historical and cultural reasons, people who harbor deep fears of male-female equality can readily come to associate such equality with social and family disintegration. We may suspect, then, that all too many German women could respond to the philistine slogan put forward by the Nazi idealogue Alfred Rosenberg, ''Emancipation from Emancipation!'' That response, moreover, could be consistent with the pre-1933 traditionalist strain of women's discourse stressing the need for lebenstraum -- a word which later became a slogan justifying German expansion, but which initially stood for ''an essentially female space.'' That 'space' mostly contained ''woman's interests as mother, consumer, homemaker, producer and churchgoer.'' But whatever the Nazis said or did in relation to women was subsumed to a broader, more malignant racial ideology. That ideology was biologized and medicalized. Everything -- including all policies of family and gender -- was to be done for the purpose of bringing about the health and strength of the Nordic race. Desirable genes were to be cultivated; undesirable ones were to be extirpated. The latter included genes transmitting diseases or defects, especially those genes associated with the ''Jewish race,'' seen as the primary source of Nordic racial illness. Concretizing this biomedical ideology in the form of mass murder and genocide became, as the Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg has demonstrated, a vast national project. By focusing exclusively on women, one runs the risk of losing sight of the full scope of that project, of some of its dimension of evil. Ms. Koonz seems to sense this danger -- hence the tentativeness and at times uneasiness of her generally feminist analysis. Ms. Koonz digs deeply and discerningly into a variety of documents, some of them previously untapped, to record the mixed results of Nazi efforts at mobilizing within various secular, Protestant and Catholic women's groups. Many in these groups were clearly embittered by the rudeness of Nazi male domination and humiliation of women, and by repeated betrayals of women leaders in denying them power. Yet there were significant female contributions to Nazi ideology. The anthropoligist Spia Sophie Rogge-Borner combined principles of matriarchy with a version of Nazi eugenics in which the ''best'' females were to reproduce actively in order to prevent Germany from becoming a ''racial swamp.'' August Reber-Gruber, a Ph.D in physical education who became the leader of the women's divison of the national Socialist Teachers Union, spoke of the ''Germanic life of the future'' as ''dominated by two absolute axioms: the laws concerning race and the laws regulating polarity between the sexes.'' She called for the integration of the 'latest psychologial methods' into a new science of race and soul (Rassescelenkunde). Despite her close attention to these ideological expressions, Ms. Koonz may have underestimated their impact on German women. In research on German doctors, I found that simply retaining Nazi ideological fragments, side by side with various degrees of skepticism, cold contribute to participating in the rwgime's brutalities and to postponing disillusionment. Such partial beliefs could contribute to a female Nazi existential spirit, as promulgated by Scholtz-Klink: ''Say to yourselves, I am the Volk' The tiny individual self [ich] must submit to the great you [Du].'' Here is what Peter Handke's mother so vibrantly responded to, and this mythos could sometimes be a family experience. Ms. Koonz quotes a German women who recalled her ''pride and joy'' as a 12-year-old girl in 1933, that ''someone needed me for a higher purpose,'' and her conviction that ''this Furher must be a wonderful man if he could make my parents so happy.'' The darkest aspects of female participation, as Ms. Koonz tells us, included not only cruel S.S. concentration-camp personell (Ilse Koch is the prototype) but the array of women who had important roles in direct medical killings (mendaciously called ''euthanasia'' by the Nazis) -- the female clerks, nurses and some physicians, who helped round up, decieve and eventually kill those (mostly mental patients) considered ''life unworthy of life.'' While created as a male movement, Nazism required and enlisted women's involvement or support in virtually all corners of the regime. Concerning resistance, Ms. Koonz makes a moving case for speical kinds in which women excelled: ''underground communications, clandestine rescue networks, and secret publicity campaigns,'' all of which were associated with classical forms of ''women's work.'' She also mentions family-like survival structures created by women inmates of concentration camps. I would add to these a survival skill I found to be especially cultivated in women prisoners: that of making careful psychological observations on their Nazi masters in the service of eliciting the least malignant forms of behavior from them. Ms. Koonz's method limits her conceptual conclusions. The book is devoted mainly to the devlopments during the early years of the Nazi movement, and although she mentions later murderous consequences, she does not fully integrate them into her account. She draws some suggestive conclusions concerning ways in which ''the Nazi 'subject' converted women and Jews into 'objects' of both social policy and of their own fantasies.'' That is certainly true, but there is also a fundamental difference. The Jews became designated victims whose destruction was necessary to the Nazi quest for vitality and revolutionary immortality (the ''Thousand Year Reich''). Though German women had some of this imagery thrust upon them, their designated role was that of a highly inferior partner in Nazi goals -- a role which often led to conflict but was nonetheless essentially carried out. A crucial aspect of that role, as Ms. Koonz points out, was to represent purity, idealized family life and ''ersatz sanity.'' Ms. Koonz can be faulted for excessive detail in some places and not enough in others, and at times her control of her own narrative falters. But she has written a book of great historical and moral importance. It invites further probing of an extremely difficult issue -- that of gender responses to situations of potential and actual evil. Ms. Koonz's work makes clear that the unsparing insights required, feminist or otherwise, are likely to be both painful and paradoxical.",1988,"Germany"
"399","Women to the Fore! (What Would Franco Say?)","West","First there was the sexual harassment case in which the judge ruled that an office manager fondled a 16-year-old clerk because he experienced an uncontrollable ''biological or psychological reaction'' to the girl's miniskirt. Then there was the rape case in which another judge acquitted two men on the ground that the 22-year-old victim led ''a licentious and disorderly life'' and had assumed the risks of being ''sexually used'' when she accepted a car ride with the accused. Yet, oddly perhaps, rather than reinforcing the stereotype of Spain as a repressive society where men strut proudly and women lower their eyes demurely, these two recent court cases have instead stirred up enough protests to demonstrate the opposite. Women's groups took to the streets and newspapers denounced the judges involved, while embarrassed politicians scrambled to proclaim their feminist beliefs. Recognizing that loopholes in the penal code were responsible for the rulings, Congress also quickly strengthened the legislation dealing with rape and sexual violence. 'We've Seen a Revolution' ''In the past, cases like these would have been normal,'' said Carmen Martinez Ten, head of the Government's Institute of Women. ''But this time there was an outcry. Society is no longer willing to accept them because, over the past 10 years, we've seen a revolution in the role of women here.'' If anything, in fact, as throwbacks to a not-too-distant past when church and state conspired to limit the rights of women, the court controversies underlined just how dramatically Spanish society has changed since the death of Franco augured the return of democracy here in 1975. ''Of all these extraordinary changes, the most important has been in the role of women,'' Amando de Miguel, a well-known sociologist, said. ''Today Spain is no longer a country where women dressed in black stream out of church. Women are now prominent in almost every walk of life.'' The emancipation of women is not yet complete. Feminists recognize the two recent court cases as untypical, but they point to continuing restrictions on a woman's right to have an abortion and note that the unemployment rate among women is twice that among men and that the average wage for women is 82 percent that for men. Women's New Attitudes But they also concede that huge progress has been made. ''Women have new attitudes, new roles, even a new physical appearance,'' said Cristina Alberdi Alonso, the first woman ever to be appointed to the 21-member General Council for Judicial Power. ''Women approach society with greater confidence these days.'' The first stage of the revolution involved adjusting the country's laws to the new rights enshrined in the 1978 Constitution. For example, divorce and family planning were legalized and women were given equal authority with their husbands over their children. They were allowed to join the armed forces and were no longer required to obtain their husbands' permission to open a bank account. Despite objections from the Roman Catholic Church, a 1986 law also authorized abortions in cases where the fetus is damaged, where pregnancy is a result of rape and where a woman's physical or psychological health are threatened. Efforts to permit social and economic conditions to justify an abortion, though, are still resisted by anti-abortion groups. Outside the country's legal framework, changes in the role of women have been even more far-reaching, affecting education, the workplace, politics and the family. ''The first woman only entered university here around 1900,'' Mr. de Miguel said. ''Today, 50 percent of university students are women.'' While jobs for women are still concentrated in the services, women are also now occupying jobs long monopolized by men. ''The first woman judge was only appointed in 1977,'' Miss Alberdi noted. ''There is still no woman among the 60 members of the Supreme Court, but we now have almost 300 women out of a total of 2,200 judges.'' Many More Seek Jobs Even the high level of unemployment among women - close to 30 percent - reflects the dramatic rise in those wanting to work. For example, Government figures show that the number of women seeking jobs jumped fivefold, to 2.8 million, from 1978 to 1988. Two of every three jobs, however, are still filled by men. In politics, women are still not prominent, but male-dominated parties are increasingly sensitive to women's votes. Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez recently appointed the first two women to his Cabinet - in charge of Information and of Social Affairs - and his Socialist Workers' Party has ruled that women must occupy 25 percent of senior party jobs. Perhaps the biggest change, though, has taken place within the family. Instead of building their lives around marriage, many young women are seeking higher education and then employment before looking for a spouse. Young women now frequently choose to live alone, a way of life that was considered morally suspect a few years ago, Further, marrying at an older age, most couples have far fewer children than their parents. ''Under Franco, people were given bonuses for large families, but our birth rate has dropped by 30 percent in 10 years,'' Miss Martinez said. ''We used to have one of the highest birth rates in Western Europe. Now it is one of the lowest.'' One interesting nod to the equality of the sexes is that, along with extending paid maternity leave from 14 to 16 weeks, new legislation also establishes four weeks of paid paternity leave. Even more unusual, one or other spouse can take an entire year off to look after a newborn without pay but without losing his or her job. Yet so drastic has been the revolution within the family that many men are still struggling to adjust to the new role of women. ''Inevitably this causes tensions,'' Miss Martinez said. ''Men say they accept the new equality, but few share responsibilities at home. This means that working women in fact have two jobs. For them, liberation comes at a high price.''",1989,"Spain"

''In marriage, women acquire equality with men and this same equality must be lived on the level of the 'great church.' '' The synod is now in its third week of discussions on the role of the Christian family, including such controversial topics as birth control, abortion, divorce and sexual equality.",1980,"Canada"
"401","BRITISH WOMEN FIGHT INEQUITY","West","Though Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher may have no cause for complaint, the situation of working women in Britain is grim. Despite laws passed 10 years ago instituting equal employment opportunities and pay, women are paid not quite 72 percent as much as men. Although women make up nearly 40 percent of the work force, only 12 percent are in managerial jobs while 75 percent are in clerical ones. In the labor movement, a powerful force in political as well as economic affairs, women are poorly represented: the General and Municipal Workers Union, with 956,000 members of whom a third are women, has no women on its National Executive Committee, only 13 women among 243 full-time officials and 3 women among the delegates to the annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress. As for pay, the average hourly wage for women employed full time is 2.07, compared with 2.88 for men (in terms of the current muchweakened pound, this is $3.93 and $5.47). Behind those data is a growing impression on the part of equalrights advocates and women's groups that the very person who should be supporting action to redress inequities, the Prime Minister, is herself responsible for intensifying them. Mrs.  Thatcher's economic policy, largely hard-line monetarism that has resulted in a postwar record of more than 2.5 million unemployed, creates resistance toward women when so many men are jobless. Obstacles to Getting Jobs ''It's much harder for women to find jobs because of high unemployment,'' said Sally Oppenheim, Minister for Consumer Affairs and the highest-ranking woman in Mrs. Thatcher's Government. ''And employers hesitate to hire women because of high maternity-leave costs.'' While the Equal Opportunities Commission says it has had no evidence that high unemployment is causing discrimination, the number of unemployed women is growing more rapidly than that of unemployed men. The commission does concede that Mrs. Thatcher's cutbacks in social services have greatly hurt the women's cause. ''Cuts in social services bear more deeply on women,'' a commission spokesman said.  ''It's a form of indirect discrimination.'' At the session of the Trades Union Congress, Marie Patterson, chairman of the women's advisory committee, asserted that women are hardest hit by Mrs. Thatcher's policies. ''Women are being hurt as workers because cuts in public services tend to hit job opportunities for women workers disproportionately, especially those who work part time,'' she said. ''Most of the hospital ancillaries, school meal staffs and home helps who are losing their jobs every day are women. And the industries worst hit by unemployment are the ones in which the majority of workers are women.'' Women are also affected in a more fundamental way. As the state reduces such welfare services as caring for the young and the elderly, women must fill the gap. ''This Government is attempting to drive women back into the home,'' Mrs. Patterson asserted. In 1970 Parliament adopted the Sex Discrimination Act, concerned with abolishing discrimination in employment, education, facilities and services, and the Equal Pay Act. Under the first measure the commission has stressed discrimination in employment, leaving other areas relatively unexplored. In university enrollment, for example, women are 36 percent of the fulltime undergraduate body, up only 6 percent since 1970. Men outnumber women at all significant levels of higher education. Both laws are now viewed as hopelessly inadequate, and the commission is constantly criticized by women's groups for being too conciliatory. First, a woman demanding equal pay must have a man in an identical job as a basis for comparison. Yet 45 percent of women work separated from men, as do 75 percent of men. ''The E.P.A. was never meant to give equal pay to all working women,'' said Jean Coussins, former women's rights attorney for the National Council for Civil Liberties, ''but only to the very small group who can actually compare their jobs to a man's with the same employers.'' Second, the burden of proof is on the complainant, who must establish unlawful discrimination, and it is rare that an employer cannot find a lawful reason for selecting a male candidate or paying him more. For nonemployment cases such as discrimination in credit opportunities or taxation, the complainant must go through the courts in an intimidating maze. Betty Lockwood, chairman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, has proposed 25 amendments to fill the loopholes in both acts, among them that women could claim equal pay even when they could not find a man for direct comparison. She also asked that the Sex Discrimination Act take precedence over other legislation that permits discrimination in taxation, social security payments, retirement age and, in rare cases, education. Similarly, Sir Geoffrey Howe, Chancellor of the Exchequer, has proposed redress in tax inequities. Now a married woman's income is treated as her husband's and only 5 percent of working married women file separately, an arduous procedure. Somewhat defensively, the commission cites the American example as a reason for not being more aggressive and not exploring affirmativeaction programs, possibly illegal under present law. The United States is viewed as experiencing a heavy undercurrent of male bitterness. Since 1948 British women have not had the same citizenship rights as men and are prevented from passing their nationality to foreign husbands. The forthcoming Nationality Bill, which the Government is backing strongly, will remove all sex and marital discrimination in this area. This is but one in a series of small victories for the commission, which, in its annual report to Parliament, also says that the discrepancy between men's and women's wages has narrowed slightly.  A Source of Complacency Part of the commission's complacency is undoubtedly based on Britain's surprisingly strong showing in the context of the European Economic Community. Britain has the second highest proportion of female workers in the Common Market, trailing Denmark by only 1.7 percent and ahead of West Germany. It also boasts the only separate discrimination watchdog commission empowered to advise the Government. And only Britain has taken discrimination cases to the European Court of Justice. Yet a recent report by the Common Market, ''European Women in Paid Employment: Their Perception of Discrimination at Work,'' indicated that 32 percent of the British women questioned were unaware of equality laws and 10 percent did not believe they existed.",1981,"United Kingdom"
"402","NOTES ON PEOPLE; Briton Wants to Redraw the Line of Succession","West","There is a woman on the British throne and a woman at the head of the British Government, but to Michael English, a member of the British House of Commons, Queen Elizabeth and Margaret Thatcher aren't enough to assure equality of the sexes in Britain. To help do that, Mr. English introduced a bill last week that would overturn the law that gives younger male offspring of British monarchs precedence over their older sisters in the line of succession to the throne. ''The monarchy,'' Mr. English said, ''is to a certain extent symbolic. Therefore, if you insure equality of the sexes applies to the succession, it is likely this will reflect in everything that still has to be done in this field.'' The bill was given little chance of passage, and it even drew a big yawn from British feminists.  ''We don't really care,'' said Ruth Walsgrove, an editor of the feminist magazine, Spare Rib. ''The monarchy is not an institution that has any relevance to the lives of ordinary women.''",1981,"United Kingdom"
"403","FLIRTING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PLOYS","West","GEORG SIMMEL: ON WOMEN, SEXUALITY, AND LOVE Translated and introduced by Guy Oakes.  194 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $20. IF we accept Georg Simmel's assertion in 1911 that ''the relationship between the sexes provides the prototype for countless relationships between the individual and the interindividual life,'' then we should be provoked into asking why this central relationship in social life remained largely neglected by sociologists around the turn of the century. In psychology, we could find many accounts of relations between men and women - by Freud, Havelock Ellis, Otto Weininger and others. But when we look to social theorists like Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Ferdinand Tonnies and others, who sought to establish sociology as an independent discipline that was to study social relationships, we search in vain for any sustained treatment of such relations.  The work of Simmel, a sociologist and philosopher, provides a fascinating exception. Guy Oakes, a professor at Monmouth College in New Jersey and the New School for Social Research in New York City, has written a valuable introduction and ably translated a selection of four essays from a whole range of pieces Simmel wrote on women, love and sexuality between 1890 and 1918. (Others, not translated here, responded to the growing conflict between the proletarian and bourgeois factions of the German women's movement before World War I and the relationship between women and a money economy and were concerned with such matters as the dowry, women by purchase, marriage and prostitution.) Simmel was recognized by many of his contemporaries as a master of the essay, and it is fitting that Mr. Oakes should present four essays rather than extracts from Simmel's books. Of the four, the most successful and perhaps the most typical of Simmel's style is his reflection on ''Flirtation.'' The posthumously published fragment ''On Love'' is part of Simmel's foray into a sociology and philosophy of emotional life that included pieces on greed, avarice, shame, gratitude and loyalty, and it points toward later attempts by phenomenologists (Max Scheler and others) to study basic human emotions. ''The Problem of the Sexes'' probably relates to Simmel's earlier reflections on the psychology of women and reveals many fin de si ecle male attitudes to women. The first essay in the collection, ''Female Culture,'' connects with Simmel's earlier interest in the women's movement in Germany and at the same time is an extension or application of his theory of the alienation of modern culture. It also bears directly, as Mr. Oakes seeks to demonstrate, on some issues in the current women's movement. The context for Simmel's essay on female culture is his theory of the ''objectification'' of human endeavor as ''objective culture'' and the widening gap between this objective (and not merely material) culture and the subjective culture of the individual personality. In general terms, Simmel says, the individual finds it increasingly difficult to realize his or her creative impulses within a culture being objectified (and depersonalized) by the specialization and division of labor. The then current question of the possibility of a qualitatively new culture (even an alternative culture) becomes particularly acute for women, since ''with the exception of a very few areas, our objective culture is thoroughly male'' - so much so that the ''naive identification'' of ''human'' with ''man'' produces a situation in which ''deficient performances in the most diverse areas are degraded as 'feminine' while outstanding performances of women are celebrated as 'thoroughly manly.' '' The male character of our culture ''is grounded in a multifaceted interweaving of historical and psychological motives.'' But while Simmel recognizes that this ''conflation of male values with values as such . . . is based on historical power relationships,'' he shows little interest in male domination as a historical problem. Rather, he turns to the psychological differentiation of men and women to explain why our objective culture is more congruent with facets of the male personality and why women's personalities (which were then seen as less differentiated) resist expression in the products of this objective culture. How can women respond to this predominantly male, objective culture? They can seek to adapt to it - in practical terms, for instance, by eliminating competition between men and women in the labor market and the production process. But Simmel points out that most often this demand is responded to by giving women differentiated tasks that are designated as ''their'' occupations. Simple adaptation to this objective culture would not, of course, change it. It will only change if women ''accomplish something that men cannot do. This is the core of the entire problem, the pivotal point of the relationship between the women's movement and objective culture.''  BUT when Simmel goes on to examine the potential contributions of women to this culture that would let them realize their own personalities within it and also provide it with a ''female nuance,'' his examples are unconvincing. Historically, one of women's crucial contributions has been to the home ''in its state of serene, self-contained completeness.'' The home is ''the supreme cultural achievement of women,'' and ''household management'' has been the location of ''secondary originality.'' In other articles on the women's movement, Simmel recognizes that this ''immense cultural achievement'' has also proved a prison house. But he is almost forced into seeing the home as a positive cultural achievement by the psychological and metaphysical dichotomies with which he seeks to deal with these issues: maleness is associated with significance, contradiction, restlessness, becoming, and femaleness with beauty, harmony, stability, being. Any critical semiologist would have a field day with Simmel's polarized images of men and women, which reveal that he was encapsulated within many of the norms of the very culture he tries to criticize. Nevertheless, Simmel does recognize the crucial problem of imposing on the female personality norms and standards derived from a male objective culture. As the sociologist of fleeting interactions and ''fortuitous fragments of reality'' and as the first major sociologist of human emotions, Simmel is more convincing on flirtation and love, the latter being ''one of the great formative categories of existence.'' In his essay on love, Simmel starts out from the I-and-you relationship as a temporary and prior one, a starting point very different and possibly more productive than all those conceptions of society that have commenced with unregulated egos. Most typical of Simmel's analysis of social interaction is the brief study of flirtation, which he views as an alternation between accommodation and denial, consent and refusal. The essay also illustrates his preoccupation with interaction as dynamic exchange. Flirtation is not merely evident in the coquette who ''neither resists, nor does she surrender,'' but also in intellectual life, in the sort of self-concealment in which a person stands behind what is expressed in a semiveiled fashion. Of course, flirtation is particularly significant in human relationships where rigid codes of conduct exist. It was a means by which the power of ''consent or refusal'' could be exercised by women: ''Flirtation is a means of enjoying this power in an enduring form.'' When men engage in flirtation, it becomes a game or a form of playing with reality. Like art, which places itself beyond reality, ''flirtation also does no more than play with reality, yet it is still reality with which it plays.'' Flirtation remains a perhaps that is ''crystallized into a thoroughly positive way of acting.'' Simmel's theoretical treatment of women, love and sexuality forms part of his wider examination of the crisis of modern culture and his desire for cultural renewal. To some readers, his discussion of women may come as something of a surprise. To others, it may come as a shock. All will be tempted to confront it critically. But all will realize that Simmel, practicing his own form of self-concealment, never intended providing the answers to the questions he posed.",1984,"Germany"
"404","A VIGOROUS FEMINIST IN THE FRENCH CABINET","West","Yvette Roudy, France's Minister for Women's Rights, likes to show visitors the artwork by women that is on the walls of her office near the Arc de Triomphe. She says there has long been a prejudice against women in the art world that makes it more difficult for them to gain recognition. She distributes matchbooks printed with photographs of reknowned feminists of the past such as Rosa Luxemburg and others. Outside her office near the entry to the ministry hangs a poster showing a freckled teen-age girl flexing her biceps next to the slogan: ''At school we can aim in all directions.'' For Mrs. Roudy, who has become the most visible and ardent advocate in France of women's rights, equality for women is a matter of small symbols and gestures as well as large ones. Mrs. Roudy, a longtime friend of President Francois Mitterrand, was named head of the new ministry when the Socialist Party was swept into power in 1981. Since then, she has become what the French call ''un personnage,'' a personality, and a figure of occasional controversy as she has pressed for Government action on behalf of women. 'Right to Contraception' She has waged television campaigns on what she calls the woman's ''right to contraception''; she has negotiated with Government ministries to hire more women; she has asked schools to help interest girls in technology; she has overseen television documentaries on great women of the past to prevent the loss, she says, of an aspect of French culture. She has been ridiculed for creating a commission to feminize the French language, meaning to give feminine forms to the names of jobs and positions held by women. All of this considerable activity, she says, is a matter of catching up for France, a country that, in her view, has lagged behind others in the West in giving women equal protections and opportunities. ''I believe that machismo in France is stronger,'' Mrs. Roudy said in a recent interview, comparing the situation in France with that in other Western countries. ''In the United States you have the great tradition of the pioneers. It's not an accident that it was Wyoming that first gave the right to vote to women. The women who came there made decisions; they fought; they were needed.'' ''Here,'' she continued, ''the social customs are much more conservative because traditional structures are more deeply fixed. We also have the Catholic religion, which, I think it's true to say, has been less liberal toward women than the Protestants. We also have the Mediterranean influence, which is more sexist in its traditions than the north.'' ''But I think that during the past four years I have managed to change the way of thinking a little bit in some areas,'' Mrs. Roudy said. ''The President of the republic was telling me the other day in front of four or five people - he said, 'Yvette, you have succeeded in changing the mentality in certain areas and that is not easy.' '' Since coming to the Ministry for Women's Rights, Mrs. Roudy has clearly shown herself to favor direct intervention by the state in women's affairs. Most important, perhaps, she has overseen the passage of three laws that give the Government a greater role in insuring the interests of women. What the Laws Do One prohibits discrimination against women in hiring and in fixing salaries, another allows women to be reimbursed by social security for the medical expenses of abortions and the third creates a Government bureau that makes the child-support payments owed by one parent to another after a divorce. Mrs. Roudy says that by creating an intermediary between the parents, conflicts that often arise over child-support payments can be avoided. And if a father fails to make payments, the state provides an advance to the mother and tries to make the father pay. ''We are behind in many respects in France,'' she said, ''particularly in the area of professional equality. I mean that in the bureaucracy there were many job categories where barriers had been put up against women. There were quotas in the police, in customs, in the army, in the Office of the Budget, even, and I'm thinking of something quite funny, among the keepers of locks - women were excluded from jobs operating locks on waterways.'' Resistance and Progress ''I negotiated with the Government ministry involved, with the unions, and I got the Prime Minister to arbitrate,'' she said. In one case, she said, the police raised their hiring quota for women from 2 percent to 20 percent. ''There is a lot of resistance,'' Mrs. Roudy said, ''a lot of effort to get around the decisions. But slowly it is moving ahead.'' In all of this, Mrs. Roudy is a presence on the feminist scene and maintains high visibility. She went on television to promote the idea that access to contraceptives is a woman's right. Her ministry, where 120 people work in a grandly restored Paris building, publishes a monthly magazine called ''Citizens in Every Sense.'' With many photographs, it closely chronicles her activities and initiatives. The ministry's press service issued an information sheet on Mrs. Roudy called ''The Exemplary Life of a Self-Made Woman'' It says she was born into ''a very modest family'' and knew class struggle before gender struggle. Mrs. Roudy has also recently published an autobiography, called ''A Cause d'Elles,'' loosely ''On Behalf of Women,'' that recounts how she became a feminist leader. Born in Pessac near Bordeaux, she went to work at the age of 16 as a typist in a fish canning plant, an experience she says was important in leading her to Socialism. She married Pierre Roudy, now the director of an acting school in Paris, and a man who, according to the book's preface by Simone de Beauvoir, was ''both older and far more cultivated than she.'' 'Never Pulled Back' In 1963 she founded a feminist organization called the Women's Democratic Movement, which, two years later, became a part of the political machine being created by Mr. Mitterrand. In her preface to ''A Cause d'Elles, Miss de Beauvoir calls Mrs. Roudy a fighter who ''never pulled back from any danger.'' ''That's true, I think, yes,'' Mrs. Roudy said. ''It seems that I do not become afraid. You can't be fearful in politics; you can't allow yourself to be intimidated.'' ''And,'' she went on, ''you should never believe it when somebody tells you something is impossible. You have to go to see yourself and to try yourself to make it possible.''",1985,"France"
"405","EQUALITY REMAINS AN ELUSIVE GOAL FOR U.N. WOMEN","West","''During the Inquisition in Spain people were forbidden to talk so that there wouldn't be conflicts,'' said Mercedes Pulido de Briceno. ''And I have realized that when it comes to women, it's like the Inquisition here at the U.N.'' As the recently appointed Coordinator for the Improvement of the Status of Women in the United Nations Secetariat, with the rank of Assistant Secretary General, Mrs. Pulido de Briceno is undaunted by resistance to her proposals for drastic changes for women in the labyrinthine bureaucracy of the world body. Mrs. Pulido de Briceno, a former minister and Cabinet member in the Venezuelan Government, acknowledges that her task is difficult: some United Nations secretaries, the vast majority of them women, are still called upon to help polish the household silver before a dinner party. Nearly seven years ago, the General Assembly ordered that women should fill one-fourth of all the professional posts in the Secretariat that are subject to ''geographical distribution'' - that is, posts that are distributed among member states roughly in proportion to their United Nations budget contributions. That target has not been met. By last year, about 700 professional posts, or 22.5 percent of the total, were held by women, up only 0.4 percent since 1982. Although women held 44 percent of the staff positions at United Nations headquarters last year, most were clustered in secretarial, clerical and service jobs at the bottom of the salary scale. No women are among the 27 Under Secretaries General, for example; 4 of the 25 Assistant Secretaries General are women. At the end of last year, the average salary for men was $44,000, for women $27,000, according to the Ad Hoc Group on Equal Rights for Women in the United Nations, an organization of staff members who are pressing for changes in the status of women here. ''I knew the situation was bad here, but I didn't realize how bad,'' said the 47-year-old Mrs. Pulido de Briceno (pronounced poo-LEE-do deh bree-SANE-yo). ''The problem is that very few women from either developed or developing countries have been sought for high-level positions.'' Critics say that, ironically, the United Nations, which sponsored the recent Decade for Women conference in Nairobi, Kenya, does not set an example for member governments. ''There is a male patriarchal attitude at the U.N., and the decade hasn't made it any better for women,'' said Isel Rivero, president of the ad hoc group. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar conceded this year that for women at the United Nations, ''the decade has not been totally successful.'' There are a number of obstacles to women's recruitment and advancement. The United Nations, for example, is not subject to affirmative action laws, so employees with grievances have no recourse. Mrs. Pulido de Briceno also contends that women are routinely hired at lower levels than men with the same qualifications and find it more difficult to get promoted. Louis-Pascal Negre, Assistant Secretary General for Personnel, disputes this. ''Maybe there are some cases,'' he said, ''but you can't generalize.'' At the same time, the normal difficulties faced by all government bureaucracies - the political maneuvering and resistance to change, for example - are compounded here because the Secretariat is an international civil service. ''Not only do you have bureaucratic inertia, but you have pressure from 159 nations to put their personnel into key positions,'' said Edward C. Luck, president of the United Nations Association of the United States, an nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that promotes international accord. The geographic distribution of jobs at the United Nations has aggravated the problem. Some countries, for example, are ''underrepresented'' -that is, they have not filled the minimum number of positions available to them - and are thus entitled to priority in filling positions. In many cases, however, these countries are reluctant to nominate women, according to United Nations officials. The specific reasons are many, but most reflect a cultural bias against having women in positions of authority and responsibility. Of the 313 professionals from Eastern Europe, for example, only 14, or less than 5 percent, are women; of the 685 professionals from Western Europe, 182, or about 26 percent, are women. In addition, certain positions have become the ''property'' of certain nations because their nationals have held the positions for several years. Member states jealously guard these senior-level positions within the United Nations hierarchy, and more and more, ambassadors lobby intensely for their own candidates -often part of their ''old boy network.'' Although any qualified individual can apply for a job at the United Nations, many governments would never allow a high-level post that ''belongs'' to them to go to a candidate who was not government-sanctioned. This is especially true for the Eastern bloc, where governments normally ''second'' or lend their employees to the world body for a fixed period. Governments are generally reluctant to put women who are on their own in a world where cocktail parties, luncheons, late-night committee meetings and formal dinners come with the territory. They fear the possibility of social, cultural and, perhaps, international embarrassments. ''These countries don't want to have single women coming alone,'' Mr. Negre said. ''I can understand that.'' There are more subtle impediments to women's advancement, including cultural attitudes that often muddle the job definition for many who work here, Mrs. Pulido de Briceno said. Because many officials come from countries where secretaries are little more than servants, their United Nations secretaries, most of them women, are sometimes asked to baby-sit, pick up guests at the airport, run personal errands, help cook and serve at parties and balance the family checkbook. Mrs. Pulido de Briceno will report on the status of women to the General Assembly next month, with recommendations for change. She said she will propose that instead of waiting for nations to submit candidates for professional jobs, the United Nations should send recruiters to seek out competent women in countries underrepresented at the United Nations. Mrs. Pulido de Briceno admitted that there is ''a policy problem here.'' But she said: ''We'll have to start negotiating and tell governments to fill certain posts with women in two years. If they say married women cannot move or don't want to send single women, they certainly must have widows and divorced women to fill these posts.'' She also wants to correct any misimpression that to get a job at the United Nations women must be nominated by their governments: no such nomination is necessary. She noted that in a number of Middle Eastern countries qualified women can be found. ''When you've got thousands of Middle Eastern women studying in Europe, you can't say there are no women available,'' she said. These are some of the other recommendations she said she will make: * Setting new targets, with 30 percent of all professional jobs to be held by women by 1990, 50 percent by 2000. * Acceptance of the recommendation endorsed unanimously at the Nairobi conference that all United Nations bodies establish an affirmative action program to achieve full equality by the year 2000. * A strong commitment to recruiting and promoting women in technical and political areas, where women are now scarcely visible. At present, two-thirds of the professional women at the United Nations are in service-oriented positions. * Promotion of women throughout the world body, not just in traditional ''women's'' fields such as education and social welfare. Whether Mrs. Pulido de Briceno can succeed is open to question. The creation of her post was vehemently opposed by several members of the personnel committee last year, and resistance might arise again if the Secretary General recommends that the position be extended. Some United Nations officials complain that many men just do not like having women around. ''There is resistance on the part of many men who don't want to be disturbed by women and who don't want women above them,'' Mr. Negre said. ''Men complain that women are more absent because of pregnancy and family reasons.'' Mrs. Pulido de Briceno admitted that she has scaled back her goals since coming to the job. ''The United Nations is very conservative, and I'm no longer looking so much at what we want as at what can be done,'' she said. ''But no one can tell me that the qualified women aren't out there.''",1985,"Spain"
"406","SWISS GRANT WOMEN EQUAL MARRIAGE RIGHTS","West","Swiss voters today narrowly approved a Government-sponsored law that gives women equal rights in marriage, eliminating the last national legal bastion of male supremacy. Approval of the law, by 54.7 percent of about one million voters, marked a milestone in the nation's movement toward sexual equality under the law, which began in 1971 with approval of women's suffrage at the federal level, and continued in 1981 with the adoption of an equal rights amendment to the Constitution. ''We have made another step forward,'' said Elisabeth Kopp, who last year became the first woman to occupy a post in the seven-member Federal Council, the Swiss executive body elected by the Parliament. ''The first was with the woman's vote, and the second with the equal rights amendment in 1981,'' she said. ''Now we can rightly say here there have been no losers.'' Behind Others in Europe Although Switzerland has often exhibited an innovative approach in other areas of social policy, such as its treatment of prisoners and drug users, it has lagged behind much of the rest of Western Europe in granting equal rights to women. Switzerland was the last Western democracy to grant women the right to vote and until today its laws had legally guaranteed a husband's supremacy in the marriage. The old laws, described by the Government as ''incompatible with female dignity,'' guaranteed the husband's role as head of the family by allowing him to prevent his wife from working, choose the couple's place of residence, and manage the savings his wife had before the marriage as well as her inheritance. It also prevented a wife from opening a bank account without her husband's approval. The new law, passed by the upper and lower houses of the Swiss Parliament last year with minor opposition from conservative members, was submitted to the electorate in a referendum after opponents conducted a petition drive. It pledges spouses to ''harmonious cooperation;'' deletes all references designating a head of the family or male decision-maker and financial manager, and obliges each spouse to provide the other with information on income, property and debts. Under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, opponents or proponents of a measure can bring it to a popular vote if they succeed in gathering at least 50,000 signatures. Some Term It 'Anti-Marriage' Despite the lack of serious opposition in the Parliament, opponents belonging to conservative and traditional organizations and including both men and women maintained that the move was ''anti-family'' and ''anti-marriage,'' and said it would turn marriage into a business-like partnership. Conservative religious opponents, including at least one Protestant pastor, had also cited biblical passages in support of the man's leading role in a marriage. Although the measure won narrow approval from the electorate nationwide, voters in 12 of Switzerland's 26 cantons, or states, rejected it. Among the states voting no was Appenzell, a predominantly rural and staunchly traditional area where women are still forbidden the right to vote on local issues. Other rural and mountainous cantons, primarily in the northern and eastern German-speaking regions, voted against the law, while more liberal and populous areas such as Zurich and Basel voted for it, as did the French- and Italian-speaking regions. In Bern, the capital, the vote was a virtual draw, with a margin of 97 voters out of more than 250,000 tipping the balance against the measure. Although the law now legally guarantees women's rights in marriage, individual families have long made their own adjustments depending on their adherence to traditional values or their desire to adopt social positions more in tune with neighboring countries such as France and West Germany. Only Liechtenstein, a tiny German-speaking monarchy between Switzerland and Austria, has proceeded more slowly. It granted women the right to vote last year.",1985,"Switzerland"
"407","CANADA LETS SOME REGAIN INDIAN STATUS","West","Earlier this summer the Canadian Parliament reversed a 114-year-old law that took Indian status away from women who married whites. Indian men had faced no such penalty, and the women they married were automatically accorded Indian status. The legislators, prodded by the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms, also struck down legislation that had taken Indian status away from Indians of either sex who took jobs off reservations, entered the armed forces, became clerics or sent their children to a non-Indian school. Yet another way of losing Indian status was seeking to vote - something Canadian Indians have been able to do only since 1962. Thus, an Indian who lost official status for any reason other than marriage was said to be ''enfranchised.'' Lost Rights in Indian Society In their own society, however, those who lost status for any cause were actually disenfranchised - barred from participation in tribal affairs, ousted from the reservation and stripped of Government benefits. The laws drove a wedge between Indian and Indian, often within the same family. ''There are still hurts regarding these distinctions,'' said Bobbi Smith, president of the Yukon Indian Women's Association. ''No other race on earth has had to give up their race in order to marry the man they loved.'' Margaret Joe, Minister of Health and Human Services for the Yukon Territory, lost her status twice, once through marriage to her first husband, a white, and again when her second, an Indian, became enfranchised. ''You start realizing how inadequate the laws of the land are,'' she said. As a result of the action taken by Parliament on June 28, Mrs. Joe and Indians across Canada are filing applications that will enable them to regain their status. Some 18,000 women who married whites are eligible, as are 8,000 disenfranchised Indians. So are their 50,000 children. Some 325,000 people now have official Indian status. #5,000 Applications Received Sandra Ginnish, acting head of the reinstatement unit, said that more than 5,000 applications had been received in Canada as a whole, with about 250 arriving each day, and the number is accelerating. In Whitehorse, 300 applications have been received and tours of Indian villages by officials are expected to yield more applications. Here in the Yukon, the wife and the children of the newly elected leader of the territorial government, Antony Penikett, is among those who have applied to regain the Indian status lost when she married a white. Malcolm Dawson, executive director of the Yukon Indian News, lost his status when his father decided to take a job as a janitor and send his children to public, rather than Indian, school. He is now applying for status, grimly recalling the fights with white youths jealous of the Indian benefits, including free eyeglasses, prescriptions and housing, they presumed he was getting. ''All the time they were giving me all the abuse, and I was not receiving any benefits,'' Mr. Dawson said. Educational Aid Is Sought Gail Anderson, a 36-year-old office worker, says her mother lost status when she married a white. Now, she is eager to get status to receive educational aid for studies in business administration. Parliament addressed the issue under the antidiscrimination provisions of the 1982 constitution. The law's effect is limited to people who lost their status during their lifetime. It does not apply to Indians who may have lost it generations ago. Another thorny point is the fact that the law deals principally with federal rights and privileges, not with membership in bands, as the Indian tribes are called. Only women who lost status through marriage are guaranteed band membership. In other cases, tribes will have to rule on their own membership. The Government's goal is to strike a balance between individual rights and tribal values, reflecting Indians' unique status. David E. Crombie, Minister of Indian Affairs, said, ''Indians have a right to be different from other people.''",1985,"Canada"
"408","Sweden's Experience As a Sexual Paradise","West","To the Editor: I suggest that those who deny a connection between pornography and rape and, in general, violence against women (or even against men, as in forced homosexual activities) or moral corruption of society should study the Swedish experience. In 1960, Sweden experienced a complete sexual revolution (liberation). Laws against and even social disapproval of pornography, nudity and every kind of sexual activity largely disappeared. Pornography was displayed alongside lollipops and was sold at newsstands. Nudity and sexual activity were commonplace in parks, at the beach, in movies and on television. A value-free, explicitly physical and promiscuous sex-education program was imposed on all schools. Sweden became a sexual paradise. But within a few years, the Government became alarmed at the increase in teen-age pregnancy, alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide (especially among teen-agers and young adults) and the general moral collapse of the young. A royal commission was appointed to study sex in Sweden. After intensive research, the commission published a voluminous report, which identified the sexual liberation as the major cause of these social evils and recommended the restoration of moral principles and more traditional standards of sexual behavior in the schools. With regard to pornography, the sense of the commission and the lesson of the Swedish sexual experiment can be summarized in the words of Hans Nestius, who had been a leader in the 1960's sexual revolution. In an interview for The Christian Science Monitor in 1981 he said: ''Free pornography doesn't lead to a decrease in rape and other crimes against women. Rape has increased . . . Pornography encourages men to think of women as objects to be used for sexual gratification. . . . Prostitution has also increased.'' R. J.

"409","A First in Spain: Study on How Women Fare","West","Spaniards do not spend much time sitting around drawing rooms debating whether Spain's is a macho society. That is a given. But a clearer idea of what that means has emerged in the first large study here of job discrimination and sexual harassment of women. The survey drew immediate approval from feminists, an endorsement from the country's largest newspaper and even agreement, though yawns, from many men. The report, by the women's department of the General Workers Union, Spain's biggest labor organization, said 84 percent of the women in the survey had experienced some form of what they regarded as sexual harassment. 'Unwanted Contact' Nearly one-third said they had been bothered by ''unwanted physical contact,'' such as being pinched or brushed against, or by sexual solicitations and telephone calls. More than half said they had experienced unwanted nonverbal sexual advances, including obscene gestures and ''lascivious looks.'' The survey questioned 772 workers in the Government, at hotels, hospitals, and metals and chemicals plants, and white-collar employees like journalists and flight attendants. It found harassment by male colleagues was focused mainly on new employees and on those from 26 to 30 years old. Others reported to be singled out were women who were divorced, separated or widowed, and non-practicing Catholics or atheists. Journalists and flight attendants said they were bothered more by their immediate supervisors and bosses. The researchers found discrimination in salaries and promotions mainly in manual-labor and blue-collar jobs like maids and factory workers and in the private sector. Many women said they believed they had been denied promotions because of their sex. Women on the job four years or more and those over 40 years old made most of the complaints about discrimination. Study's Recommendations The study offers several recommendations, including new laws to prohibit sexual harassment and programs to make employers aware of their responsibilities. It also recommends psychological support for victims and help for women in resisting harassment. The report and recommendations by the union, which is closely tied to the governing Socialist Party, will be presented to Parliament next month for action, an official of the women's department said. The survey was seen as significant because it dealt with a subject that apparently has not been taken very seriously by men. And although more women seem to be speaking up, the women's rights movement is still small and weak. ''The report bears out what we've been saying for years,'' Montserrat Fernandez Garrido, a Feminist Party leader, said. ''Whenever we've brought up the issue, nobody paid any attention. We're glad it has now seen the light of day.'' In a July 30 editorial calling for stronger laws, the newspaper El Pais, said, ''Beneath the traditionally Spanish macho mask lies a system of segregation that allows men to make the decisions.'' It concluded, ''There is no reason why women should have to continue paying for the simple fact of wanting to be part of a world under the same conditions as others.'' Lessons for Women Maria Perez Garcia, deputy director of the Women's Institute, a Government-financed agency dealing with women's problems, added: ''On the whole, women aren't taught self-respect. It's highly important to learn that they can reject sexual harassment, that they learn to identify it and see it as something not natural.''

"410","Rome Synod Is Focusing on Women's Rights","West","The need to correct discrimination against women in the Roman Catholic Church has emerged as a major theme of a Synod of Bishops meeting here on the role of lay Catholics. Since the assembly began Oct. 1, women's rights in society and in the church have been defended dozens of times in speeches by bishops and lay observers from around the world. Several senior Catholic leaders have called for church action on behalf of sexual equality, arguing that simple proclamations of women's dignity will no longer suffice. A variety of specific requests have been heard, including proposals that women be ordained as deacons and that they be given positions of responsibility in the Vatican's male-dominated bureaucracy. The church's prohibition on the ordination of women as priests has been discussed but not openly opposed. Basil Cardinal Hume, Archbishop of Westminster, England, said today that it was ''urgent to recognize the role of women'' in the church, and he complained that theological confusion had developed over the liturgical functions that women could properly perform. One of many prelates to focus exclusively on the issue of women in his speech was Bishop Jean-Guy Hamelin of Rouyn-Noranda, Canada, who said in the Synod this morning that the church's arguments against the ordination of women ''are not very convincing, above all to the young.'' He argued that women should be allowed to lead local church councils, theological commissions and tribunals that decide on requests for marriage annulments. ''The very credibility of the church is affected if we do not actively seek out the means to assure an equitable representation of women and men on all the levels of ecclesial life,'' Bishop Hamelin said. At a news conference today Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis said, ''No theme has been more frequently mentioned in this Synod than that of women in their role in church and society.'' Archbishop May, president of the United States Bishops' Conference, added that ''there is a clear consensus that the church must do everthing in its power to put an end to unjust discrimination against women'' both inside and outside the church. But he emphasized that the Synod, as an advisory body to Pope John Paul II with no policy-making powers, ''is not going to get into all kinds of specific recommendations, but it will issue an extremely clear statement of principles.'' While in the past the role of women in the church was an issue raised primarily by North American and European Catholics, Archbishop May noted today that at this assembly of some 230 bishops the issue has been addressed by prelates from every continent. Stressed in Opening Address The importance of the issue was highlighted in an opening address Oct. 2 by Hyacinthe Cardinal Thiandoum, Archbishop of Dakar, Senegal, who is moderator of the Synod. According to a Vatican spokesman the Cardinal told the assembly: ''Full dignity of women is something which has not been fully attained in reality. It will not be attained simply by saying that the two sexes are the same or that women have the same tasks as men.'' He called on the Synod to recognize as one of its ''most important tasks'' the need to ''remove inequalities which exist in the church so that those inequalities which exist in society no longer exist in the church.'' Several speakers have demanded that the church remove barriers that block women from many functions ranging from altar servers, those who assist priests in saying Mass, to administrative officers in the Roman Curia, the Vatican bureaucracy. Some, including Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee, have argued that since power in the church is linked to the priesthood, urgent changes are needed to allow women to enter decision-making roles that can be performed by lay people.",1987,"Italy"
"411","VIVE LA DIFFERENCE","West","I'm sure there are American women who enjoy the French penchant for la difference, but I've never met one. When I lived in France last year, I was flabbergasted by the unapologetic use of naked female bodies to sell everything from cups of coffee to chewing gum. On a more serious note, Paris itself offers not a single shelter for victims of domestic violence. In fact, in countless ads on French television, it is women who are portrayed as the more abusive sex - leading men on, only to reject them. In a culture blind to sexism as a ''social problem,'' women's only real power is purely sexual. LISSA McLAUGHLIN   Providence, R.I.",1988,"France"
"412","Pornography War Among Feminists; Do women need state protection from sexually explicit materials?","West","The presidential candidates, although otherwise bastinadoed, have been lucky so far in that no one has asked whether they believe pornography should join obscenity as being outside the protection of the First Amendment. Whatever the answer, a candidate will be in trouble with one or more of the warring groups of feminists on this issue. For instance, after the New York Times Magazine recently ran a reverential profile of law professor Catharine MacKinnon -- who regards pornography as a clear and present danger to women's lives -- a letter arrived from Marilyn Fitterman, president of the New York affiliate of the National Organization for Women. (It was co-signed by Karen DeCrow, former national president of NOW.) They strongly object to MacKinnon's legislation -- which has been offered in a number of states -- that would allow a woman to sue the makers and distributors of pornography that she claimed had harmed her. The woman would have to prove that the sexually aggressive work had caused someone to damage her. A similar bill is now under consideration in Massachusetts. MacKinnon testified there that ""pornography currently has more protection than women do."" The two women from NOW wrote, however, that ""censorship has been, throughout history, the single most widely used patriarchal tool for 'protecting' women -- from birth control, abortion, sexual satisfaction and non-heterosexualrelationships. Without free speech we can have no feminist movement. And if the anti-porn censorship is enacted, it is the right-wing-packed courts ... who will decide what materials are printable in the United States."" MacKinnon, who has considerable support among some feminists, is accustomed to dissenters. In her earlier losing battles to get her pornography-smiting law past the courts -- in Minneapolis, Indianapolis (that one went all the way to the Supreme Court) and Bellingham, Wash., among other places -- she was always confronted by free-speech feminists. She claimed they didn't get it. They said the MacKinnon law would eventually censor sexually charged writing by women. I saw MacKinnon recently at a conference in Sacramento on harmful language, and she was very cheerful. She had just helped persuade the Supreme Court of Canada to adopt -- unanimously -- her thesis that pornography harmful to women can and should be outlawed. That court, in redefining Canada's criminal obscenity law, now includes ""materials that subordinate, degrade or dehumanize women."" By contrast,MacKinnon told the New York Times ""our laws don't consider the harm to women."" The previous time I had seen her, a year and a half ago, MacKinnon had been grim after her string of losses. But she said she would be going into court again and again until pornography is dealt with here as the virulent pathology it is. Now, MacKinnon may be on a roll. After the historic win in Canada, there is the Massachusetts bill before the legislature, and the sense among more and more women -- intensified by a rise in reported rapes including ""date rapes"" -- that violence against women is on the rise. MacKinnon has insisted for years that there is a direct connection between pornography -- visual and written -- and assaults on women. Yet the most comprehensive current study of all available sources -- Marcia Pally's ""Sense and Censorship: The Vanity of Bonfires"" (published by the Freedom to Read Foundation and Americans for Constitutional Freedom) -- convincingly disproves MacKinnon's claim. But many women believe her on faith -- and anger. Meanwhile, another group of First Amendment feminists has formed to combat the Pornography Victims' Compensation Act introduced by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). It would allow victims of sex crime to sue the sellers, distributors and producers of obscene material and child pornography. The plaintiffs would have to ""prove"" a direct connection between the harm done and what the assailant read or saw. MacKinnon considers the bill too limited. Obscenity is already unprotected by the First Amendment. It is pornography that has to be nailed to the wall. The McConnell bill is being attacked, on free speech grounds, by Feminists for Free Expression (Betty Friedan, Susan Jacoby, Nora Ephron, Judith Krug, Nadine Strossen and many more). They say: ""Women are as varied as any citizens of a democracy; there is no agreement or feminist code as to what images are distasteful or even sexist."" Women, these self-reliant feminists assert, do not need intervention of the state for their own good. They do not require ""protection from explicit sexual materials.""",1992,"Canada"
"413","Canada Opens Doors To Refugee Claims Based on Gender; Increasing Number of Women Seeking Asylum","West","Canada is opening its borders to a potentially vast new class of refugees -- women deemed to be at risk in their home countries because of their sex. Recent gender-based claims of persecution before two-person refugee tribunals here, which rule on petitions for Canadian asylum, reflect the broad range of human rights abuses faced by women around the world, from retribution for divergent political opinions about the status of women, to punishment for behavior deemed at odds with societal norms, to officially sanctioned rape and domestic violence. In the most recent case to draw widespread attention here, Canada's federal immigration minister, Bernard Valcourt, took the extraordinary step of overruling a refugee tribunal in order to grant a Saudi woman, known only as ""Nada,"" the right to immigrate. The woman had argued that her outspoken opposition to the subordinate status of women in traditional Saudi society -- and her refusal to wear a veil -- put her at risk in her native kingdom. Though the tribunal in her case was unconvinced of her claim, Valcourt exercised his ministerial prerogative to intervene. A prominent Canadian human rights advocate, Ed Broadbent, joined Human Rights Watch and other organizations in championing Nada's cause. The 24-year-old refugee, who lives in Montreal, said that she fears for the safety of her parents in Saudi Arabia were her identity known. Domestic abuse cases involving applicants from Third World countries have begun to enter Canada's refugee pipeline in growing numbers, according to refugee lawyers here, often attracting the support of sympathetic politicians and exposure in the news media. Last year, for example, a young woman from Trinidad named Dularie Boodlal prevailed upon Canadian officials not to deport her and her three children after her husband, she said in an interview, threatened ""to cut me into pieces if I came home."" International attention likely will sharpen early next month, when Nurjehan N. Mawani, chairman of Canada's Immigration and Refugee Board, is scheduled to issue new guidelines that explicitly recognize for the first time refugee applications by women who say they are being persecuted or harmed strictly because of their gender. A draft of the guidelines circulated last year noted in part: ""The fact that violence, including sexual violence, against women is universal is irrelevant when determining whether rape and other gender-specific crimes constitute forms of persecution."" Arthur Helton, who heads the refugee project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights in New York, said the guidelines could serve as a model for other countries, as well as attract fresh numbers of women claiming refugee status in Canada. Mawani recently cited the 30,000 to 50,000 Muslim women who reportedly have been raped in Serbs' ""ethnic cleansing"" of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whom she qualified as refugees ""by any interpretation."" But spousal abuse warranting refugee protection is considerably more complicated, she said. Mawani, who immigrated here from Kenya, said in recent public remarks that ""in cases where the state makes no effort to protect a severely battered woman, or stop or punish a violent partner, and where no protection can be obtained within her own country . . . she is, in essence, fleeing for her life."" The guidelines are designed to provide the 280 refugee arbitrators scattered across Canada with a consistent method of interpreting the basic texts of international refugee law, according to officials and consultants who have worked on them. Clearer guidance, the officials say, might have settled the Nada case without ministerial intervention. The arbitrators, more than 40 percent of whom are women, rule on about 29,000 refugee applications of all kinds each year -- only a handful of which, thus far, have involved gender-based claims. They grant refugee status to about 58 percent of them. The refugee board does not specify the grounds of the applications. The 1951 United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees, on which the laws of Western nations are often modeled, makes no mention of gender. It defines a refugee as ""any person who [has] a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion"" and does not feel adequately protected by law enforcement authorities in his or her country of origin. Some refugee policy analysts believe ""membership in a particular social group"" is flexible-enough language to protect women like Nada and Boodlal. In their view, there is little support for amending the U.N. convention itself, as some have suggested, at a time when so many of its members, far from wanting to expand the definition of refugee, would like to eliminate categories of protection. Canada has one of the world's more liberal records in gender-based refugee issues, according to analysts in the field. According to Nancy Kelly, of the Human Rights Project at Harvard Law School, ""Canada is at the forefront of interpreting the U.N. convention to recognize gender-based persecution as a legitimate basis for asylum. U.S. courts have yet to recognize it."" Mawani said the guidelines will set strict standards for admission and her board will be on the alert for refugees who try to abuse the process. But she warned against cynicism in the face of the applicants' plights: ""We cannot blame the hopeless for seeking any possible avenue as a means to escape that hopelessness. In other words, we should not put them down for trying.""",1993,"Canada"
"414","France's embrace of liberty tested by Muslim dress; In country with deep Christian roots, political leaders push to ban women in burqas and veils from public spaces","West","France, which regards itself as the cradle of human rights, is moving to impose legal restrictions on Muslim women who wear Afghan-style burqas or other full-face veils. The restrictions, likely to apply to many public places, come in response to resentment in France and other European countries over the growing visibility of Muslims -- immigrants or locally born -- on a continent with ancient Christian roots. The tensions have long run through European societies but increasingly are coming to the surface as the number of Muslims grows and symbols of their faith, including mosques, are seen as a challenge to European traditions. Andre Gerin, a member of Parliament who recently completed six months of hearings on the burqa controversy, said that he has nothing against the more than five million Muslims in France but that full-face veils are the visible tip of an Islamist underground that threatens the French way of life. Although veiled women are estimated to number no more than several thousand in this country of 64 million, Gerin said, behind them are what he called ""gurus"" who are trying to impose Islamic law on French society. For instance, Gerin said, doctors at the Mother and Child Hospital in Lyon told him during a visit Thursday that they are threatened several times a week by angry Muslim men who refuse to allow their pregnant wives or daughters to be treated by male doctors, even for emergency births when nobody else is available. ""The scope of the problem is a lot broader than I thought,"" he said at a news conference here summing up his findings. ""It is insidious."" Gerin said representatives of several other European countries, as well as Canada, have expressed interest in his hearings, which included testimony from women's advocacy figures, Muslim leaders and sociologists. Gerin, who also is mayor in the working-class Lyon suburb of Venissieux, said his parliamentary commission will present formal recommendations for legislation Jan. 26. They will probably urge a nonpartisan parliamentary resolution condemning full-face veils in principle, he said, to be followed by targeted decrees or laws banning veils in public facilities such as town halls, and then a general law prohibiting full veils in as many places as possible under the French constitution. As Gerin described it, that law would bar fully veiled women from, for instance, walking down the Champs Elysees. ""Our objective is not to stigmatize these women, but to be clean, clear-cut and precise -- the full-face veil has no place in France,"" he declared. Women's advocacy groups, some of which include Muslim women, have strongly endorsed the proposed legislation to ban the full-face veil on grounds it offends women's dignity and symbolizes oppression by men. But several young Muslim women interviewed by French journalists have responded that they wear the veil of their own accord because they want to affirm adherence to a fundamentalist version of Islam. Getting a jump on Gerin's commission, the leader of President Nicolas Sarkozy's parliamentary majority, Jean-Francois Cope, this week formally proposed a law banning full-face veils in any public place, including the streets. More than 200 members of Parliament backed his suggested legislation, he said. Defense Minister Herve Morin, a centrist allied with Sarkozy, predicted such broad legislation would be unconstitutional. Moreover, he added, it could lead to embarrassing situations with foreigners, such as Persian Gulf billionaires who arrive in Paris with their fully veiled wives. Sarkozy and his prime minister, Francois Fillon, responded to the clamor by saying they want Parliament first to vote that a unanimous resolution declaring the full-face veil is unacceptable in France. Then, they added in apparently coordinated statements, they will push for laws calibrated to ban the burqa as much as possible in public places without earning a rebuke from the Constitutional Council, the body that rules on constitutional issues. The legislation should be debated only after regional elections scheduled in March, they added, to keep it from being caught up in party politics. Critics, particularly in the opposition Socialist Party, have charged much of Sarkozy's concern over the issue, including his organization of a ""national identity debate,"" is designed to curry favor with right-wing voters. France's Muslim establishment, including the government-encouraged Muslim Religion Council, has declared that nothing in Islam requires women to wear full-face veils. At the same time, the council leader, Mohammed Moussaoui, has been reluctant to criticize women who wear a full veil and voiced fears that a legal ban would ""stigmatize"" Muslims in the same way he said they were stigmatized by a 2004 law banning headscarves in public schools. In addition to the restrictions on full veils, Gerin said, his commission will urge the government to hand down new guidance for doctors, teachers and mayors who have to deal with what he called ""threats and violence"" from fundamentalist Muslims. History or biology teachers frequently are challenged by fundamentalist adolescents whose religious beliefs are contradicted by what they hear in school, he said, and in some communities half the girls in junior high physical education classes refuse to participate on religious grounds. ""Their ideas are not in conformity with our society,"" he added.",2010,"France"

"416","Women's Rights Gain In Diverse Countries","West","MORE THAN 100 WOMEN who are active in women's organizations in the Washington area gathered early this week in a WETA-TV studio for a satellite chat with women from Atlanta, Boston and Copenhagen where a United Nations conference on women was winding up.  The idea, according to organizer Shoshana Riemer of Arlington, was to provide an opportunity for American women who could not attend the conference to question women who could about how their countries have responded to goals set five years ago at the International Women's Conference in Mexico City. The American women heard from such diverse countries as Peru, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya, Portugal, Sri Lanka and New Zealand.  The message from abroad is one American women have been hearing at home: Progress has been made in these countries towards improving and equalizing the status of women, but there is still a long way to go. The questions from American women in the three cities hooked up for the satellite conversation focused on women's health, education and employment, and they produced interesting insights into the way women are living in foreign countries.  Literacy, for example, is a major problem in a country such as Kenya where, ""if any hardship comes to the family, it's the girl who is asked to stay at home and the boys keep on in school,"" as a Kenyan doctor explained. But many of these countries have recently passed laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex or race and mandating that women be paid the same as men. Two years after its 1974 revolution, Portugal adopted a new constitution in which sex discrimination was prohibited.  It also adopted a family law giving both men and women the same rights in a family unit and doing away with the head of the family concept.  Portugal's new family law also recognizes the right of women to choose between a professional life and work at home and states that work inside the home and child-raising have value. New Zealand also recognizes work inside the home and child-rearing by paying a family benefit for each child, usually to the mother.  This work inside the home is further recognized under New Zealand divorce law which presumes a 50-50 property split. Countries such as Kenya and New Zealand have found that passing equal-pay legislation is only the first step toward equal treatment of women in the workplace.  The Kenyan doctor said her country now needs ""to get women working so they can take advantage"" of equal pay.  In New Zealand, women have found that they need to publicize the existence of equal pay legislation in order to inform women what they are entitled to. A Nigerian woman said that agricultural extension workers have been advising women in rural areas of her country to try to increase their income as well as their output.  The Great Nigerian Deal, apparently, is that rural women work of farms and city men come and buy their products for little more than cost and then, you guessed it, sell them off in the cities and make a killing. American women heard of more familiar problems in New Zealand where, as a New Zealand woman put it, ""barriers of attitude . . . and some structural barriers still exist"" in education and employment.  She said her country needs to revise its curriculum and textbooks to remove the boys-do-math stereotypes.  There are not enough women in executive jobs in New Zealand industry and government, she said, and New Zealand feminists are devising programs for ""fostering women"" and training them ""so they can support each other and feel good about taking on extra responsibility.  We do strike attitudinal barriers -- (such as) women don't want to work for a woman boss."" The woman doctor from Kenya said her country has made some progress in moving women into middle-level management, although it still has no women in parliament and no women judges.  But Kenyan women have at least succeeded in getting some of the day care they need and have themselves set up more than 6,000 day care centers, above and beyond government and private industry centers. Sri Lanka is considering legislation that would make child care facilities compulsory in factories.  As a woman from Sri Lanka put it, ""the extended family is dying out and help is dying out."" Middle-income families can't afford nannies."" That may sound familiar, but it was the woman from Portugal who got the biggest round of understanding laughter from the studio audience in Arlington, when she sounded a refrain that apparently is now being heard around the world: ""It is always the mother who takes care of bringing the child, and collecting the child,"" she said.  ""It is not just a day care system we need, but a sharing of responsibilities.""",1980,"New Zealand"
